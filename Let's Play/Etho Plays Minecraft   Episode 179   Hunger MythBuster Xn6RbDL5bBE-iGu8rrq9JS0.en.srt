a little trick i learned while building

56
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

57
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,390

61
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,429
yeah so it's done uh the only thing left
to do now is to light up the caves in

62
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
to do now is to light up the caves in
 

63
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:35,990
to do now is to light up the caves in
the area

64
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
the area
 

65
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,230
the area
and until i do that it's going to be

66
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
and until i do that it's going to be
 

67
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,749
and until i do that it's going to be
pretty slow rates

68
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
pretty slow rates
 

69
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,350
pretty slow rates

all this land between the mob
 

93
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,790
all this land between the mob
system and here so that's about

94
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
system and here so that's about
 

95
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,510
system and here so that's about
20 blocks up we got to take outs a lot

96
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
20 blocks up we got to take outs a lot
 

97
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,949
20 blocks up we got to take outs a lot
of blocks

98
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
of blocks
 

99
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,309
of blocks
uh i'm gonna use tnt for that

100
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
uh i'm gonna use tnt for that
 

101
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,589
uh i'm gonna use tnt for that
let's go take a look outside if i can

102

have another tube in the middle and
 

109
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,869
have another tube in the middle and
we'll have slimes going through that

110
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
we'll have slimes going through that
 

111
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,229
we'll have slimes going through that
i think that might be cool if we can

112
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
i think that might be cool if we can
 

113
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,150
i think that might be cool if we can
find a slime chunk around here and make

114
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
find a slime chunk around here and make
 

115
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,589
find a slime chunk around here and make
it work out if not

116
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
it work out if not
 

117
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,350

silverfish
 

121
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,229
silverfish
room have sort of been taking place

122
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
room have sort of been taking place
 

123

00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
i cleared out the big mess underneath
 

125
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,949
i cleared out the big mess underneath
and killed most the silverfish i think

126
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
and killed most the silverfish i think
 

127
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,110
and killed most the silverfish i think
i broke the blocks encouraged them to

128
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
i broke the blocks encouraged them to
 

129
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,149
i broke the blocks encouraged them to
come out and then

130
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
come out and then
 

131
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,350
come out and then
kill them all all that i could find

132
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
kill them all all that i could find
 

133
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,670
kill them all all that i could find
so hopefully that mess is cleaned up got

134
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
so hopefully that mess is cleaned up got
 

135
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,149
so hopefully that mess is cleaned up got
rid of

rid of
 

137
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,350
rid of
a lot more of the lava and i'm still

parkouring around here
i'll cut to outside because this might

142
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
i'll cut to outside because this might
 

143
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,630
i'll cut to outside because this might
take me a while to get out of

144
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

145
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,869

00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
all right let's jump off i'll show you
 

147
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,190
all right let's jump off i'll show you
how high up it is

148
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200

 

149
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,030

quite a ways this is what it looks like

153
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,830

it looks a lot better as snow i gotta

154
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
it looks a lot better as snow i gotta
 

155
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,309
it looks a lot better as snow i gotta
say compared to cobble or wood it looks

156
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
say compared to cobble or wood it looks
 

157
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,270
say compared to cobble or wood it looks
really cool i might add some more

158
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
really cool i might add some more
 

159
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,990
really cool i might add some more

will get started because i got to
 

219

will get started because i got to
share some information

220
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039

 

221
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,629

oh yeah so this thing's working a lot

222
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
oh yeah so this thing's working a lot
 

223
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,510
oh yeah so this thing's working a lot
better now

224
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
better now
 

225
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,189
better now
that we have a few more layers on it

226
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
that we have a few more layers on it
 

227
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,430
that we have a few more layers on it
but once we get the caves all lit up

228
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
but once we get the caves all lit up
 

229
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,270
but once we get the caves all lit up
around here it's going to make a huge

230
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
around here it's going to make a huge
 

231
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,990
around here it's going to make a huge
difference

232

difference
 

233
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,270
difference
it'll be a lot lot better so we'll try

234
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
it'll be a lot lot better so we'll try
 

235

it'll be a lot lot better so we'll try
to do that sometime

check it out the signs are set up
 

241
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,469
check it out the signs are set up
charts are already here you are about to

today's mythbuster episode is going to
 

247

today's mythbuster episode is going to
be

248
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
be
 

249
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,670
be
about the minecraft hunger system

250
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
about the minecraft hunger system
 

251
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,390
about the minecraft hunger system
and i'm going to wager a bet that the

252
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
and i'm going to wager a bet that the
 

253
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,550
and i'm going to wager a bet that the
majority of the people that play this

254
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
majority of the people that play this
 

255
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,029
majority of the people that play this
game

256
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
game
 

257
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,550
game
have no idea how it works and before

258
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
have no idea how it works and before
 

259
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,189
have no idea how it works and before
today i was also one of them

260
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
today i was also one of them
 

261
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,870
today i was also one of them
and the reason for that is because the

262
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
and the reason for that is because the
 

263
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,590
and the reason for that is because the
hunger system in this game is very

264
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
hunger system in this game is very
 

265
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,469
hunger system in this game is very
unintuitive or in other words you

266
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
unintuitive or in other words you
 

267
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,550
unintuitive or in other words you
wouldn't know how it works unless

268
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
wouldn't know how it works unless
 

269
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,670
wouldn't know how it works unless
you spent many hours trying to figure it

270
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
you spent many hours trying to figure it
 

271
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,230
you spent many hours trying to figure it
out

272
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
out
 

273
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,230
out
or if you were to

274
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
or if you were to
 

275
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,830
or if you were to
look at the game code you might figure

276
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
look at the game code you might figure
 

277
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,749
look at the game code you might figure
it out that way

278
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
it out that way
 

279
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,070
it out that way
or if you had someone explain it to you

280
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
or if you had someone explain it to you
 

281
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,749
or if you had someone explain it to you
like i'm going to try to

282
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
like i'm going to try to
 

283

way i originally
 

293
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,469
way i originally

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,390
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20. so

346
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
19 20. so
 

347
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,869
19 20. so
that's our easy to reproduce measurement

348
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
that's our easy to reproduce measurement
 

349
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,309
that's our easy to reproduce measurement
system

350
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319

 

351
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,550

okay so the way i originally thought the

352
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
okay so the way i originally thought the
 

353
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,510
okay so the way i originally thought the
hunger worked

354
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
hunger worked
 

355
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,869
hunger worked
is if right now i'm down two and a half

is if right now i'm down two and a half
 

357
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,629
is if right now i'm down two and a half
bars right

358
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
bars right
 

359
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,749
bars right
eating steak recovers for

eating steak recovers for
four of those so i thought there was an

362
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
four of those so i thought there was an
 

363
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,830
four of those so i thought there was an
overflow to it

364
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
overflow to it
 

365
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,869
overflow to it
where it'll it only shows 10 but i

366
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
where it'll it only shows 10 but i
 

367
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,589
where it'll it only shows 10 but i
thought

368
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
thought
 

369
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,629
thought
in this case i would have what's

370
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
in this case i would have what's
 

371
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,070
in this case i would have what's
two and a half 11 and a half hunger

372
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
two and a half 11 and a half hunger
 

373
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,110
two and a half 11 and a half hunger
at the moment or or food i should say 11

374
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
at the moment or or food i should say 11
 

375
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,390
at the moment or or food i should say 11
and a half food

376
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
and a half food
 

377
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,950
and a half food
i thought there would be a 1.5 overflow

378
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
i thought there would be a 1.5 overflow
 

379
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,550
i thought there would be a 1.5 overflow
there that's the way i thought it always

380
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
there that's the way i thought it always
 

381
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,029
there that's the way i thought it always
worked because

382

watermelon

388
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
watermelon
 

389
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,909
watermelon
when you're when your food's at nine and

390
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
when you're when your food's at nine and
 

391
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,709
when you're when your food's at nine and
a half

392
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
a half
 

393
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,190
a half
compared to when you would eat a steak

394
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
compared to when you would eat a steak
 

395
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,269
compared to when you would eat a steak
when it's nine and a half

396
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
when it's nine and a half
 

397
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,190
when it's nine and a half
uh generally the steak

398
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
uh generally the steak
 

399
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,670
uh generally the steak
would keep you full a lot longer than

400
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
would keep you full a lot longer than
 

401
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,310
would keep you full a lot longer than
the watermelon that's

402
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
the watermelon that's
 

403
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,150
the watermelon that's
pretty pretty well known and

404
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160

 

405
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,710

i think a lot of people figured that's

406
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
i think a lot of people figured that's
 

407
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,990
i think a lot of people figured that's
the way it works

408
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
the way it works
 

409
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,310
the way it works
but it turns out there's actually two

410
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
but it turns out there's actually two
 

411
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,990
but it turns out there's actually two

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,990
figured out
exactly the method to it and

508
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
exactly the method to it and
 

509
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,829
exactly the method to it and
exact data values for the food in the

510
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
exact data values for the food in the
 

511
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,069
exact data values for the food in the
game and as well as exact data values

512
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
game and as well as exact data values
 

513
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,910
game and as well as exact data values
for the different actions in the game

514
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
for the different actions in the game
 

515
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,030
for the different actions in the game
and how they

516
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
and how they
 

517
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,550
and how they
take away your food so

518
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
take away your food so
 

519
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,630
take away your food so
it's very interesting i or at least i

520
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
it's very interesting i or at least i
 

521
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
it's very interesting i or at least i
thought it was and i encourage you to

522
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
thought it was and i encourage you to

and we're kind of gonna go over that

530
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
and we're kind of gonna go over that
 

531
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,389
and we're kind of gonna go over that
info today

info today
 

533
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,150

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
and uh dissect it a little bit do a
 

535
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,470
and uh dissect it a little bit do a
little

536
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
little
 

537
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,910
little
a few tests here there's a little bit of

538
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
a few tests here there's a little bit of
 

539
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,030
a few tests here there's a little bit of
conflicting if

540
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
conflicting if
 

541
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,949
conflicting if
info on it there's two charts that don't

542
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
info on it there's two charts that don't
 

543
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,790
info on it there's two charts that don't
really seem to

544
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
really seem to
 

545
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,550
really seem to
agree with each other totally um

546
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
agree with each other totally um
 

547
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,710
agree with each other totally um
but overall is pretty accurate and

548
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
but overall is pretty accurate and
 

549
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,150
but overall is pretty accurate and
there's a few things i wasn't really

550
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
there's a few things i wasn't really
 

551
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,710
there's a few things i wasn't really
sure about

552
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
sure about
 

553
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,310
sure about
either which i would like to check out

554
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
either which i would like to check out
 

555
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,590
either which i would like to check out
um so first of all like i said there's

556
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
um so first of all like i said there's
 

557
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,550
um so first of all like i said there's
two different food bars in this game

558
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
two different food bars in this game
 

559
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,550
two different food bars in this game
there's this one here that we can see

560
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560

 

561
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,030

and there's also a separate one an

562
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
and there's also a separate one an
 

563
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,990
and there's also a separate one an
invisible one

564
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
invisible one
 

565
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,870
invisible one
called the saturation bar which we can't

566
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
called the saturation bar which we can't
 

567
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,990
called the saturation bar which we can't
see

568
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
see
 

569
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,430
see
both of them have 20 points

570
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
both of them have 20 points
 

571
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,829
both of them have 20 points
maximum that we can have so each of

572
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
maximum that we can have so each of
 

573
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,190
maximum that we can have so each of
these food

574
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
these food
 

575
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,110
these food
bars each of these chicken legs counts

576
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
bars each of these chicken legs counts
 

577
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,710
bars each of these chicken legs counts
as two points

578
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
as two points
 

579
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,750
as two points
so we have three five seven seven and a

580
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
so we have three five seven seven and a
 

581
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,470
so we have three five seven seven and a
half here

582
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
half here
 

583
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,990
half here
which times that by twos 15 points

584
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
which times that by twos 15 points
 

585
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,829
which times that by twos 15 points
is our food value here out of a total of

586
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
is our food value here out of a total of
 

587
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:23,990
is our food value here out of a total of
20.

588
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
20.
 

589
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,310
20.
if we were to eat this steak it's good

590
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
if we were to eat this steak it's good
 

591
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,590
if we were to eat this steak it's good
for eight points

592
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
for eight points
 

593
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,269
for eight points
and uh there's only room for five points

594
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
and uh there's only room for five points
 

595
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,670
and uh there's only room for five points
here

596
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
here
 

597
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,910
here
so three points would actually go to

598
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
so three points would actually go to
 

599
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,949
so three points would actually go to
waste because there is no

600
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
waste because there is no
 

601
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,670
waste because there is no
overflow on this bar so you can actually

602
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
overflow on this bar so you can actually
 

603
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,829
overflow on this bar so you can actually
waste food in this game and most people

604
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
waste food in this game and most people
 

605
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,030
waste food in this game and most people
do

606
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
do
 

607
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,310
do
um from ignorance

608
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
um from ignorance
 

609
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,030
um from ignorance
and convenience and other reasons as

610
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
and convenience and other reasons as
 

611
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,829
and convenience and other reasons as
well i'm sure

612
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
well i'm sure
 

613
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,670
well i'm sure
um like i said i had no idea how this

614
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
um like i said i had no idea how this
 

615
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,550
um like i said i had no idea how this
worked until

616
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
worked until
 

617
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,990
worked until
i read the wiki page today

618
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000

 

619
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,990

but anyway there's two different food

620
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
but anyway there's two different food
 

621
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,069
but anyway there's two different food
bars and every food item in this game

622
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
bars and every food item in this game
 

623
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,030
bars and every food item in this game
also has

624
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
also has
 

625
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,190
also has
two different food values and i have

626
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
two different food values and i have
 

627
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,269
two different food values and i have
them arranged from least to greatest

628
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
them arranged from least to greatest
 

629
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,110
them arranged from least to greatest
here

630
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
here
 

631
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,389
here
cookies as you know are garbage

632
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399

 

633
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,470

but if you look at spider-eyes and

634
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
but if you look at spider-eyes and
 

635
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,910
but if you look at spider-eyes and
watermelon for example

636
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
watermelon for example
 

637
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,269
watermelon for example
both of them recover one or two points

638
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
both of them recover one or two points
 

639
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,750
both of them recover one or two points
on this bar here

640
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
on this bar here
 

641
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,230
on this bar here
but they have two completely different

642
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
but they have two completely different
 

643
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,870
but they have two completely different
values

644
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
values
 

645
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,829
values
this one's 5.2 and this one's 3.2

646
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839

 

647
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,069

so

648
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
so
 

649
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,389
so
top the the number two at the top here

650
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
top the the number two at the top here
 

651
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,829
top the the number two at the top here
is the one we know

652
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
is the one we know
 

653
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,790
is the one we know
that's goes two points to this food bar

654
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
that's goes two points to this food bar
 

655
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,870
that's goes two points to this food bar
and then also adds 1.2

656
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
and then also adds 1.2
 

657
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,750
and then also adds 1.2
points to the saturation bar which we

658
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
points to the saturation bar which we
 

659
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,030
points to the saturation bar which we
can't see

660
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
can't see
 

661
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,069
can't see
so for a total of 3.2

662
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
so for a total of 3.2
 

663
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,310
so for a total of 3.2
food value if we go over to spider eyes

664
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
food value if we go over to spider eyes
 

665
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,710
food value if we go over to spider eyes
they

666
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
they
 

667
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,470
they
are quite a bit better actually they

668
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
are quite a bit better actually they
 

669
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,990
are quite a bit better actually they
have

670
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
have
 

671
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,629
have
two points plus 3.2 to the saturation

672
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
two points plus 3.2 to the saturation
 

673
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,110
two points plus 3.2 to the saturation
bar

674
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
bar
 

675
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,150
bar
for a total of 5.2 that's

676
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
for a total of 5.2 that's
 

677
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,590
for a total of 5.2 that's

watermelon even though they seem to be
 

681
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,670
watermelon even though they seem to be
the same

682
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
the same
 

683
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,750
the same
according to what we can see on the main

684
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
according to what we can see on the main
 

685
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,350
according to what we can see on the main
food bar here

686
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
food bar here
 

687
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,350
food bar here
so you can you know when the saturation

688
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
so you can you know when the saturation
 

689
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,990
so you can you know when the saturation
bar

690
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
bar
 

691
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,030
bar
is empty if your your main food bar

692
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
is empty if your your main food bar
 

693
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,150
is empty if your your main food bar
is jittering uh that's the only

694
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
is jittering uh that's the only
 

695
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,829
is jittering uh that's the only
real visible sign of it right now my

696
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
real visible sign of it right now my
 

697
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,670
real visible sign of it right now my
food bar is not jittering but if i jump

698
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
food bar is not jittering but if i jump
 

699
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,189
food bar is not jittering but if i jump
around a little bit

700
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
around a little bit
 

701
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,030
around a little bit
we can use up our saturation bar

702
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
we can use up our saturation bar
 

703
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,350
we can use up our saturation bar
completely and you can see now

704
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360

 

705
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,949

just so happened i didn't have much in

706
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
just so happened i didn't have much in
 

707
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,550
just so happened i didn't have much in
it so it

708
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
it so it
 

709
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,509
it so it
emptied pretty quick there and now the

710
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
emptied pretty quick there and now the
 

711
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,189
emptied pretty quick there and now the
the food bar is jumping up and down

712
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
the food bar is jumping up and down
 

713
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,790
the food bar is jumping up and down
which means

714
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
which means
 

715
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,870
which means
my second food bar is at zero and now

716
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
my second food bar is at zero and now
 

717
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,910
my second food bar is at zero and now
we're using up

718
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
we're using up
 

719
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,470
we're using up
this food bar here you only use up this

720
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
this food bar here you only use up this
 

721
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,910
this food bar here you only use up this
food bar here if

722
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
food bar here if
 

723
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,550
food bar here if
if your saturation one is empty and then

724
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
if your saturation one is empty and then
 

725
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,670
if your saturation one is empty and then
this starts jittering

726
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680

 

727
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,509

alrighty so maybe we'll go through all

728
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
alrighty so maybe we'll go through all
 

729
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,590
alrighty so maybe we'll go through all
the food items here and see what their

730
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
the food items here and see what their
 

731
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,509
the food items here and see what their
actual food values are for the two

732
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
actual food values are for the two
 

733
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,430
actual food values are for the two

basically is what it is

746
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
basically is what it is
 

747
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,389
basically is what it is
for a combined total of 1.2 points

for a combined total of 1.2 points
 

749
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,389
for a combined total of 1.2 points
and we know from our jumping experiment

750
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
and we know from our jumping experiment
 

751
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,430
and we know from our jumping experiment
before

752
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
before
 

753
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,310
before
we can jump 20 times per point so

754
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
we can jump 20 times per point so
 

755
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,430
we can jump 20 times per point so
if we were to eat a cookie and get

756
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
if we were to eat a cookie and get
 

757
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,629
if we were to eat a cookie and get
no food wasted from it 1.2 times

758
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
no food wasted from it 1.2 times
 

759
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,629
no food wasted from it 1.2 times
20. eating a single cookie would allow

760
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
20. eating a single cookie would allow
 

761
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,509
20. eating a single cookie would allow
us to jump

762
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
us to jump
 

763
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,430
us to jump
24 times assuming we're not doing any

24 times assuming we're not doing any
 

765
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,269
24 times assuming we're not doing any
other action that

766
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
other action that
 

767
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,910
other action that
takes away our food anyway moving on

768
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
takes away our food anyway moving on
 

769
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,509
takes away our food anyway moving on
that's how that works

770
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
that's how that works

did notice this before i used to always
 

795
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,509
did notice this before i used to always
eat spider eyes then i switched to

796
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
eat spider eyes then i switched to
 

797
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,030
eat spider eyes then i switched to

799
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,110

and i found after i would eat a spider

800
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
and i found after i would eat a spider
 

801
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,230
and i found after i would eat a spider
eye

eye
 

803
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,310

i would get or after i would eat a

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
i would get or after i would eat a
 

805
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,990
i would get or after i would eat a
watermelon i would get hunger

806
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
watermelon i would get hunger
 

807
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,189
watermelon i would get hunger
hungry a lot faster than after i ate

808
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
hungry a lot faster than after i ate
 

809
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,790
hungry a lot faster than after i ate
a spider eye and that's because the

810
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
a spider eye and that's because the
 

811
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,590
a spider eye and that's because the
saturation value is a whopping

812
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
saturation value is a whopping
 

813
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,350

815
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,470
3.2 compared to the 1.2
of the watermelon so it is quite a

because you can eat it six

852
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
because you can eat it six
 

853
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,990
because you can eat it six
times and so this first number here is

so if you compare that to watermelon

878
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,240
so if you compare that to watermelon
 

879
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,710
so if you compare that to watermelon
20.8 divided by

or more filling than a watermelon so
 

891
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,029
or more filling than a watermelon so
that's

892
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
that's
 

893
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,390
that's
how you can use these numbers together

894
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
how you can use these numbers together
 

895
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,630
how you can use these numbers together
as well using our jumping illustration

896
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:41,640
as well using our jumping illustration

20.8 times 20
 

899
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,230
20.8 times 20
that would allow us to jump 416 times so

900
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
that would allow us to jump 416 times so
 

901
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,470
that would allow us to jump 416 times so
that's how many actions of jumping we

902
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
that's how many actions of jumping we
 

903
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,669
that's how many actions of jumping we
can perform

904
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
can perform
 

905
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,390
can perform
per cooked one if we don't waste any

906
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
per cooked one if we don't waste any
 

907
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,190
per cooked one if we don't waste any
um now let's go let's move on to the

908
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
um now let's go let's move on to the
 

909
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,150
um now let's go let's move on to the
actions these are

it's 0.1 per
 

975
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,310
it's 0.1 per
per block or meter so sprinting

blocks jumping we've covered
 

987
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,710
blocks jumping we've covered
is 0.2 so

988
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
is 0.2 so
 

989
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,470
is 0.2 so
again if we take 4 divide that by 0.2

990
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
again if we take 4 divide that by 0.2
 

991
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,430
again if we take 4 divide that by 0.2
we get 20 and that's how we get our

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
we get 20 and that's how we get our
 

993
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,990
we get 20 and that's how we get our

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960

 

1011
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,590

and what else block breaking a lot of

1012
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
and what else block breaking a lot of
 

1013
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,549
and what else block breaking a lot of
these i haven't tested block breaking is

1014
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
these i haven't tested block breaking is
 

1015
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,029
these i haven't tested block breaking is
one of them we can break

1016
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,039
one of them we can break
 

1017
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,710
one of them we can break
160 blocks before we use up the food

1018
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
160 blocks before we use up the food
 

1019
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,470
160 blocks before we use up the food
points

1020
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
points
 

1021
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,190
points
and then attacking a mob or whatever

1022
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
and then attacking a mob or whatever
 

1023
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,909
and then attacking a mob or whatever
takes

1024
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:40,919
takes
 

1025
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,230
takes
13.33 hits before we use up

1026
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
13.33 hits before we use up
 

1027
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,310
13.33 hits before we use up
like 13.3 three swings

1028
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
like 13.3 three swings
 

1029
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,590
like 13.3 three swings
at before we use up one

1030
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
at before we use up one
 

1031
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,270
at before we use up one
food point we're going to test this one

1032
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
food point we're going to test this one
 

1033
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,270
food point we're going to test this one
today probably because i'm not sure if a

1034
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
today probably because i'm not sure if a
 

1035
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,350
today probably because i'm not sure if a
miscounts as a swing or if it has to hit

1036
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
miscounts as a swing or if it has to hit
 

1037
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,110
miscounts as a swing or if it has to hit
the mob to use up your food

1038
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120

 

1039
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,430

damage that's us taking damage is the

1040
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
damage that's us taking damage is the
 

1041
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,029
damage that's us taking damage is the
same

1042
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
same
 

1043
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,430
same
and then food poison that's what you get

1044
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
and then food poison that's what you get
 

1045
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,830
and then food poison that's what you get
when you eat

1046
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
when you eat
 

1047
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,950
when you eat
zombie flesh sometimes seventy percent

1048
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
zombie flesh sometimes seventy percent
 

1049
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,789
zombie flesh sometimes seventy percent
of the time you get food poisoning

1050
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
of the time you get food poisoning
 

1051
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,909
of the time you get food poisoning
and then this will take away our food

1052
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919

 

1053
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,830

it should be if we divide fifteen by

1054
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
it should be if we divide fifteen by
 

1055
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,110
it should be if we divide fifteen by
four

1056
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,120

 

1057
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,950

3.75 points i think it

1058
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
3.75 points i think it
 

1059
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,630
3.75 points i think it
should take away i'm a little confused

1060
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
should take away i'm a little confused
 

1061
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,110
should take away i'm a little confused
about this one

1062
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
about this one
 

1063
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,789
about this one
over the duration of the entire

1064
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
over the duration of the entire
 

1065
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,510
over the duration of the entire
poisoning see it's still going down

1066
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
poisoning see it's still going down
 

1067
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,110
poisoning see it's still going down
i'm actually going to watch that back

1068
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
i'm actually going to watch that back
 

1069
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,430
i'm actually going to watch that back
and see if it took away 3.75

1070
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
and see if it took away 3.75
 

1071
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,430
and see if it took away 3.75
roughly

1072
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440

 

1073
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,510

yeah it seems to be correct because

1074
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
yeah it seems to be correct because
 

1075
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,950
yeah it seems to be correct because
zombie flesh gives you

1076
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
zombie flesh gives you
 

1077
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,110
zombie flesh gives you
1.8 saturation so that gets removed and

1078
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
1.8 saturation so that gets removed and
 

1079
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,110
1.8 saturation so that gets removed and
then your food starts to go down so we

1080
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
then your food starts to go down so we
 

1081
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,990
then your food starts to go down so we
went from

1082
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
went from
 

1083
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,510
went from
seven not seven fifteen

1084
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
seven not seven fifteen
 

1085
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,029
seven not seven fifteen
down to twelve so that's

1086
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
down to twelve so that's
 

1087
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,590
down to twelve so that's
that's 1.5 there plus the 1.8

1088
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600

 

1089
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,830

that is 3.3 and

1090
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
that is 3.3 and
 

1091
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,590
that is 3.3 and
since we can't see exactly what it is

1092
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
since we can't see exactly what it is
 

1093
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,549
since we can't see exactly what it is
that seems pretty close to 3.75

1094
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
that seems pretty close to 3.75
 

1095
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,149
that seems pretty close to 3.75
so it seems to be accurate

1096
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
so it seems to be accurate
 

1097
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,909
so it seems to be accurate
let's test one of these let's test

1098
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
let's test one of these let's test
 

1099
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,190
let's test one of these let's test
watermelon because i had

1100
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
watermelon because i had
 

1101
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,950
watermelon because i had
i haven't actually tested any of these

1102
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
i haven't actually tested any of these
 

1103
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,430
i haven't actually tested any of these
food values to make sure they're correct

1104
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
food values to make sure they're correct
 

1105
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,750
food values to make sure they're correct
and i'll show you how we can do that

1106
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
and i'll show you how we can do that
 

1107
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,630
and i'll show you how we can do that
let's jump

1108
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
let's jump
 

1109
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,549
let's jump
until our food just goes down

1110
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
until our food just goes down
 

1111
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,029
until our food just goes down
there we go we're going to eat a

1112
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
there we go we're going to eat a
 

1113
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,269
there we go we're going to eat a
watermelon

1114
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279

 

1115
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,190

and now our food birds not jittering

1116
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
and now our food birds not jittering
 

1117
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,630
and now our food birds not jittering
that means we have food in our

1118
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
that means we have food in our
 

1119
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,510
that means we have food in our
saturation so

1120
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
saturation so
 

1121
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,269
saturation so
1.2 in our saturation if we jump

1122
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:57,279
1.2 in our saturation if we jump
 

1123
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,390
1.2 in our saturation if we jump
what was it 20 times 1.2

1124
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
what was it 20 times 1.2
 

1125
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,990
what was it 20 times 1.2
i think it was 24 times

1126
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
i think it was 24 times
 

1127
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,110
i think it was 24 times
yes once we jump 24 times

1128
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
yes once we jump 24 times
 

1129
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,190
yes once we jump 24 times
uh our food bar should start jittering

1130
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
uh our food bar should start jittering
 

1131
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,390
uh our food bar should start jittering
so let's try that out

1132
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
so let's try that out
 

1133
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,590
so let's try that out
1 2 3 4 5

1134
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
1 2 3 4 5

1141
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,830
16 17 18 19 20 21 22
23 still not jittering

1142
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
23 still not jittering
 

1143
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,990
23 still not jittering
next time we jump it should start

1144
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000

 

1145
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,430

oh

1146
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440

 

1147
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,070

25 did i count wrong

1148
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
25 did i count wrong
 

1149
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,029
25 did i count wrong
oh boy 26

1150
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039

 

1151
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,830

something's not right here 27

1152
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840

 

1153
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,149

28

1154
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159

1155
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,430

29

1156
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440

 

1157
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,190

30 31 32

1158
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
30 31 32

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,630
30 31 32
33 34 35 36

1160
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
33 34 35 36
 

1161
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,269
33 34 35 36
37 38 39 40 what is going on there

1162
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:15,279
37 38 39 40 what is going on there
 

1163
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,110
37 38 39 40 what is going on there
finally started jittering

1164
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
finally started jittering
 

1165
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,269
finally started jittering
40. so these values were last updated

1166
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
40. so these values were last updated
 

1167
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,430
40. so these values were last updated
1.1 i think the wiki said

1168
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
1.1 i think the wiki said
 

1169
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,390
1.1 i think the wiki said
so um

1170
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
so um
 

1171
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,669
so um
yeah this might have got changed that's

1172
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
yeah this might have got changed that's
 

1173

still hasn't gone down next jump will do

1188
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
still hasn't gone down next jump will do
 

1189
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,870
still hasn't gone down next jump will do
it

1190
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
it
 

1191
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,390
it
there we go so 40 so this

1192
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
there we go so 40 so this
 

1193
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,669
there we go so 40 so this
value should actually be

1194
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
value should actually be
 

1195
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,669
value should actually be
2 not 1.2 and this should be

1196
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
2 not 1.2 and this should be
 

1197
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,430
2 not 1.2 and this should be
4 total interesting so we

1198
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
4 total interesting so we
 

1199
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,510
4 total interesting so we
may have to test all these to figure it

1200
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
may have to test all these to figure it
 

1201
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,630
may have to test all these to figure it
out exactly what it is now

1202
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640

 

1203
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,110

so we know it's been updated but
 

1225
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,630
so we know it's been updated but
apparently in the new version that we're

using right now
 

1229
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,269
using right now
it's a little bit different from what

1230

today
 

1237
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,230
today
especially these bigger numbers would be

1238
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
especially these bigger numbers would be
 

1239
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,310
especially these bigger numbers would be
hard to check in the game

1240
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
hard to check in the game
 

1241
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,990
hard to check in the game
using that method i showed

1242
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000

 

1243
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,269

getting poisoned from zombie flesh it's
actually

1258
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
actually
 

1259
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,710

exhaustion you divide that by four

1266
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
exhaustion you divide that by four
 

1267
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,870
exhaustion you divide that by four
and that gets you the total number of

1268
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
and that gets you the total number of
 

1269
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,750
and that gets you the total number of
points you lose which is 3.75

13 is the limit which tells me that it's

1338
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
13 is the limit which tells me that it's
 

1339
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,669
13 is the limit which tells me that it's
additive so if watermelons give you 2 to

1340
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
additive so if watermelons give you 2 to
 

1341
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,549
additive so if watermelons give you 2 to
the saturation

1342
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
the saturation
 

1343
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,350
the saturation
if i was to use up a bunch of my food

1344
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
if i was to use up a bunch of my food
 

1345
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,269
if i was to use up a bunch of my food
here

1346
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:15,279
here
 

1347
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,710
here
let's try this out just something i want

1348
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:18,720
let's try this out just something i want
 

1349
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,789
let's try this out just something i want
to figure out

1350
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799

 

1351
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,510

okay so i think we just used up the food

1352
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
okay so i think we just used up the food
 

1353
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,669
okay so i think we just used up the food
i shouldn't be moving around

1354
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
i shouldn't be moving around
 

1355
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,710
i shouldn't be moving around
moving uses up your

1356
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
moving uses up your
 

1357
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,190
moving uses up your
ah again i didn't time that very well

1358
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
ah again i didn't time that very well
 

1359
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,510
ah again i didn't time that very well
okay let's make sure we get it at the

1360
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
okay let's make sure we get it at the
 

1361
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,510
okay let's make sure we get it at the
right jump here

1362
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
right jump here
 

1363
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,269
right jump here
it was that jump so if we were to eat

1364
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
it was that jump so if we were to eat
 

1365
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,669
it was that jump so if we were to eat
two watermelons in a row now

1366
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679

 

1367
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,269

that should give us a total of four

1368
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
that should give us a total of four
 

1369
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,310
that should give us a total of four
saturation because

1370
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
saturation because
 

1371
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,149
saturation because
we're allowed to have that we have more

1372
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
we're allowed to have that we have more
 

1373
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,350
we're allowed to have that we have more
than 4

1374
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
than 4
 

1375
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,789
than 4
points in our main food bar so that

1376
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
points in our main food bar so that
 

1377
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,230
points in our main food bar so that
would allow us to jump

1378
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
would allow us to jump
 

1379
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,269
would allow us to jump
what is it 4 would be

1380
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
what is it 4 would be
 

1381
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,590
what is it 4 would be
times 20 80 times

1382
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
times 20 80 times
 

1383
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,269
times 20 80 times
and believe it or not i'm going to test

1384
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
and believe it or not i'm going to test
 

1385
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,549
and believe it or not i'm going to test
this so i'll be right back

1386
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
this so i'll be right back
 

1387
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,950
this so i'll be right back
yeah so there's still some hidden pieces

1388
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
yeah so there's still some hidden pieces
 

1389
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,990
yeah so there's still some hidden pieces
to this puzzle

1390
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
to this puzzle
 

1391
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,070
to this puzzle
um i've tried this twice now eating two

1392
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
um i've tried this twice now eating two
 

1393
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,909
um i've tried this twice now eating two
watermelons in a row will allow you to

1394
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
watermelons in a row will allow you to
 

1395
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,310
watermelons in a row will allow you to
jump

1396
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
jump
 

1397
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,470
jump
60 times before you use up the

1398
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
60 times before you use up the
 

1399
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,430
60 times before you use up the
saturation so that would be

1400
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
saturation so that would be
 

1401
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,669
saturation so that would be
three total from two

1402
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
three total from two
 

1403
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,789
three total from two
so somehow one point gets lost there

1404
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
so somehow one point gets lost there
 

1405
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,350
so somehow one point gets lost there
if you eat two in a row i've tried many

1406
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
if you eat two in a row i've tried many
 

1407
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,070
if you eat two in a row i've tried many
times

1408
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
times
 

1409
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,230
times
just being a single one it's always 40

1410
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
just being a single one it's always 40
 

1411
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,269
just being a single one it's always 40
jumps

1412
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
jumps
 

1413
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,470
jumps
which is two so

1414
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480

 

1415
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,230

yeah there's a bit to this that we don't

1416
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah there's a bit to this that we don't
 

1417
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,830
yeah there's a bit to this that we don't
know yet

1418
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
know yet
 

1419
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,990
know yet
uh but regardless it's pretty

1420
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
uh but regardless it's pretty
 

1421
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,350
uh but regardless it's pretty
interesting stuff requires more testing

1422
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
interesting stuff requires more testing
 

1423
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,950
interesting stuff requires more testing
more figuring out some other time

1424
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
more figuring out some other time
 

1425
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,870
more figuring out some other time
and i'm not necessarily the guy that's

1426
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
and i'm not necessarily the guy that's
 

1427
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,389
and i'm not necessarily the guy that's
going to do it

1428
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
going to do it
 

1429
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,950
going to do it
i'm going to try i want to confirm

1430
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
i'm going to try i want to confirm
 

1431
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,470
i'm going to try i want to confirm
sprinting

1432
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
sprinting
 

1433
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,230
sprinting
so maybe we'll head to the surface and

1434
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
so maybe we'll head to the surface and
 

1435
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,430
so maybe we'll head to the surface and
do a f3

1436
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,440
do a f3
 

1437
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,750
do a f3
point a to point b test and i also

1438
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
point a to point b test and i also
 

1439
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,149
point a to point b test and i also
wanted to try

1440
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
wanted to try
 

1441
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,830
wanted to try
getting or attacking uh

1442
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
getting or attacking uh
 

1443
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,669
getting or attacking uh
actually we can do that pretty simple

1444
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
actually we can do that pretty simple
 

1445
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,590
actually we can do that pretty simple
right now to figure out if missing

1446
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600

 

1447
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,710

counts for anything

1448
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720

 

1449
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,070

saturation is used up if we swing wildly

1450
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
saturation is used up if we swing wildly
 

1451
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,110
saturation is used up if we swing wildly
in the air

1452
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
in the air
 

1453
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,149
in the air
let's see if it uses up any food

1454
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
let's see if it uses up any food
 

1455
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,029
let's see if it uses up any food
we've swung more than 13.33 times now so

1456
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:51,039
we've swung more than 13.33 times now so
 

1457
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,430
we've swung more than 13.33 times now so
does not appear to

1458
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440

 

1459
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,430

and then we will go actually try hit a

1460
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440
and then we will go actually try hit a
 

1461
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,830
and then we will go actually try hit a
mob and see if that does it

1462
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
mob and see if that does it
 

1463
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,230
mob and see if that does it
okay so this is our sprinting test we

1464
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,240
okay so this is our sprinting test we
 

1465
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,950
okay so this is our sprinting test we
are going to run 40 blocks

1466
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
are going to run 40 blocks
 

1467
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,350
are going to run 40 blocks
we are at negative 340 right now we are

1468
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
we are at negative 340 right now we are
 

1469
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,430
we are at negative 340 right now we are
going to run to i think negative

1470
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
going to run to i think negative
 

1471
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,389
going to run to i think negative
380 and stop and see if it uses up a

1472
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
380 and stop and see if it uses up a
 

1473
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,389
380 and stop and see if it uses up a
food bar

1474
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
food bar
 

1475
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,630
food bar
or a food point i should say i just used

1476
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
or a food point i should say i just used
 

1477
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,990
or a food point i should say i just used
up one so

1478
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
up one so
 

1479
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,590
up one so
by jumping so here we go

1480
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
by jumping so here we go
 

1481
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:32,789
by jumping so here we go
i'm gonna run straight as i can

1482
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799

 

1483
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,070

and bingo

1484
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
and bingo
 

1485
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,590
and bingo
so that looked pretty right to me um

1486
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
so that looked pretty right to me um
 

1487
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,230
so that looked pretty right to me um
that's sprinting let's try taking damage

1488
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
that's sprinting let's try taking damage
 

1489
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,389
that's sprinting let's try taking damage
take this stuff off so 13.33 hits

1490
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399

 

1491
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,430

cactus will do we will have to do a

1492
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
cactus will do we will have to do a
 

1493
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,950
cactus will do we will have to do a
little bit of walking which drains

1494
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
little bit of walking which drains
 

1495
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,310
little bit of walking which drains
hunger but it's very

1496
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,320
hunger but it's very
 

1497
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,710
hunger but it's very
very small so i don't think it will

1498
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
very small so i don't think it will
 

1499
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,590
very small so i don't think it will
influence our rough test here

1500
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
