wrong yeah we're at our lab here I'm
 

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,529
wrong yeah we're at our lab here I'm
anxious to get this all built and get

the circle for the black wall it's

14
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:33,149
the circle for the black wall it's
 

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,720
the circle for the black wall it's
really dark here I'm a little worried

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:35,730
really dark here I'm a little worried
 

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,459
really dark here I'm a little worried
about placing torches because they will

18
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:37,469
about placing torches because they will
 

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,869
about placing torches because they will
melt our ice below if I'm not careful so

20
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
melt our ice below if I'm not careful so
 

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,280
melt our ice below if I'm not careful so
I'm going to make a backup before I do

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,290
I'm going to make a backup before I do
 

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm going to make a backup before I do
that and as you see we have a huge

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,210
that and as you see we have a huge
 

25
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,700
that and as you see we have a huge
floating thing above us now instead of

26
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:52,710
floating thing above us now instead of
 

27
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,060
floating thing above us now instead of
just a small floating thing I started

28
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,070
just a small floating thing I started
 

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,729
just a small floating thing I started
expanding this floor out of snow still

30
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:01,739
expanding this floor out of snow still
 

31
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,340
expanding this floor out of snow still
got a ways to go this will be the mob

32
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,350
got a ways to go this will be the mob
 

33
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,789
got a ways to go this will be the mob
sorting floor as I said before and it

34
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
sorting floor as I said before and it
 

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,770
sorting floor as I said before and it
will also be our ceiling for this room

36
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:12,780
will also be our ceiling for this room
 

37
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,550
will also be our ceiling for this room
down here although we may if it seems

38
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
down here although we may if it seems
 

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,460
down here although we may if it seems
like it's too high we may add extra

40
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,470
like it's too high we may add extra
 

41
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,730
like it's too high we may add extra
floors in between and lower the ceiling

42
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:24,740

 

43
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,950

it's up to us we can decide later I

44
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,960
it's up to us we can decide later I
 

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,200
it's up to us we can decide later I
moved our stick our ladder it's over

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,210
moved our stick our ladder it's over
 

47
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,539
moved our stick our ladder it's over
here now and it looks like I'm gonna

48
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:35,549
here now and it looks like I'm gonna
 

49
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,950
here now and it looks like I'm gonna
have to move it again because it's in

50
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
have to move it again because it's in
 

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,539
have to move it again because it's in
the way again and yeah things are

52
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:41,549
the way again and yeah things are
 

53
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,370
the way again and yeah things are
different around here now what happened

54
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,380
different around here now what happened
 

55
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,130
different around here now what happened
is I realized that the spawning pads

56
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,140
is I realized that the spawning pads
 

57
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,969
is I realized that the spawning pads
were just too small

58
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:53,979
were just too small
 

59
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,730
were just too small
I'll explain how I threw that out later

60
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:56,740
I'll explain how I threw that out later
 

61
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,010
I'll explain how I threw that out later
but yeah that was a problem they're too

62
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,020
but yeah that was a problem they're too
 

63
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,870
but yeah that was a problem they're too
small so I expanded them here before we

64
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:03,880
small so I expanded them here before we
 

65
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,660
small so I expanded them here before we
just had that one that one that one and

66
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:06,670
just had that one that one that one and
 

67
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,470
just had that one that one that one and
that one for spawning pets 100 us now we

68
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,480
that one for spawning pets 100 us now we
 

69
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,390
that one for spawning pets 100 us now we
had a hundred blocks of spawning space I

70
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:15,400
had a hundred blocks of spawning space I
 

71
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,280
had a hundred blocks of spawning space I
added this one in the center

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,290
added this one in the center
 

73
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,100
added this one in the center
maybe you suggested that and then I

74
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,110
maybe you suggested that and then I
 

75
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,530
maybe you suggested that and then I
added these ones on the side so we have

76
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,540
added these ones on the side so we have
 

77
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,190
added these ones on the side so we have
12 big pads now in this little one in

78
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
12 big pads now in this little one in
 

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,780
12 big pads now in this little one in
the center so we had a hundred 100 spots

80
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:33,790
the center so we had a hundred 100 spots
 

81
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,340
the center so we had a hundred 100 spots
originally now we have three hundred and

82
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,350
originally now we have three hundred and
 

83
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:46,860
originally now we have three hundred and
five six eight five three hundred and

84
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:46,870
five six eight five three hundred and
 

85
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,530
five six eight five three hundred and
thirteen bondable spots now and we will

86
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,540
thirteen bondable spots now and we will
 

87
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,110
thirteen bondable spots now and we will
get rid of

88
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
get rid of
 

89
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,570
get rid of
it's a little extra stuff we have I also

90
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,580
it's a little extra stuff we have I also
 

91
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,550
it's a little extra stuff we have I also
realized last episode that I built my

92
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
realized last episode that I built my
 

93
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,290
realized last episode that I built my
spawning pads in the wrong place they

94
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,300
spawning pads in the wrong place they
 

95
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,339
spawning pads in the wrong place they
were shifted over one block so I fixed

96
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:10,349
were shifted over one block so I fixed
 

97
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,930
were shifted over one block so I fixed
that to extend this I simply went up one

98
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
that to extend this I simply went up one
 

99
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,270
that to extend this I simply went up one
block vertically and extended out

100
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
block vertically and extended out
 

101
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,550
block vertically and extended out
another eight blocks so we have another

102
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,560
another eight blocks so we have another
 

103
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,839
another eight blocks so we have another
full-length water stream here that's one

104
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:23,849
full-length water stream here that's one
 

105
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,210
full-length water stream here that's one
of the reasons why I've made my diamond

106
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
of the reasons why I've made my diamond
 

107
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,070
of the reasons why I've made my diamond
shape spawning pads

108
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
shape spawning pads
 

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,479
shape spawning pads
base seven one two three four five six

110
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,489
base seven one two three four five six
 

111
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,750
base seven one two three four five six
seven with the one block airspace

112
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
seven with the one block airspace
 

113
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,080
seven with the one block airspace
between each one because that that makes

114
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,090
between each one because that that makes
 

115
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,089
between each one because that that makes
it eight blocks so that's the same

116
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:41,099
it eight blocks so that's the same
 

117
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,850
it eight blocks so that's the same
length as water will flow so this works

118
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:43,860
length as water will flow so this works
 

119
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,470
length as water will flow so this works
out pretty much perfect if we want to

120
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
out pretty much perfect if we want to
 

121
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,110
out pretty much perfect if we want to
extend it and it's this be spawning pad

122
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
extend it and it's this be spawning pad
 

123
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,729
extend it and it's this be spawning pad
zero higher one block as well sorry

124
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:00,739
zero higher one block as well sorry
 

125
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:08,110
zero higher one block as well sorry
sorry about that mine sheep bad habit

126
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,120

 

127
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,370

okay the one thing I need to decide

128
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,380
okay the one thing I need to decide
 

129
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,890
okay the one thing I need to decide
right now is what I'm doing for the

130
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:12,900
right now is what I'm doing for the
 

131
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,819
right now is what I'm doing for the
ceiling in here people have told me not

132
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:16,829
ceiling in here people have told me not
 

133
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,680
ceiling in here people have told me not
to use sandstone since of the snowy

134
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:18,690
to use sandstone since of the snowy
 

135
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,659
to use sandstone since of the snowy
biome I like using sandstone I have

136
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:23,669
biome I like using sandstone I have
 

137
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,830
biome I like using sandstone I have
tried both here and I believe I'm gonna

138
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
tried both here and I believe I'm gonna
 

139
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,830
tried both here and I believe I'm gonna
use sandstone for the ceiling now keep

140
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:30,840
use sandstone for the ceiling now keep
 

141
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,390
use sandstone for the ceiling now keep
in mind there's not gonna be any snow or

142
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
in mind there's not gonna be any snow or
 

143
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,710
in mind there's not gonna be any snow or
ice anywhere near these passive mob

144
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
ice anywhere near these passive mob
 

145
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,409
ice anywhere near these passive mob
spawning pads you won't see any snow or

146
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:39,419
spawning pads you won't see any snow or
 

147
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,230
spawning pads you won't see any snow or
ice and the sandstone is gonna be

148
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
ice and the sandstone is gonna be
 

149
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,850
ice and the sandstone is gonna be
covered so I don't think there's

150
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:46,860
covered so I don't think there's
 

151
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,680
covered so I don't think there's
anything wrong with using it it's not

152
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,690
anything wrong with using it it's not
 

153
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,020
anything wrong with using it it's not
going to clash with snow and ice because

154
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,030
going to clash with snow and ice because
 

155
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,730
going to clash with snow and ice because
they'll be none around basically

156
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:53,740
they'll be none around basically
 

157
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,040
they'll be none around basically
and over here I had a test setup where I

158
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,050
and over here I had a test setup where I
 

159
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,180
and over here I had a test setup where I
was seeing what level grass will stay

160
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,190
was seeing what level grass will stay
 

161
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,960
was seeing what level grass will stay
alive if it's covered by water

162
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:02,970
alive if it's covered by water

last video a guy named Skyliner W tested
this out and he found grass will stay

172
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,010
this out and he found grass will stay
 

173
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,340
this out and he found grass will stay
alive if it's at light level seven or

174
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,350
alive if it's at light level seven or
 

175
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,540
alive if it's at light level seven or
more it's covered with water so we have

176
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,550
more it's covered with water so we have
 

177
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,910
more it's covered with water so we have
torches here that's light level 14 at

178
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:26,920
torches here that's light level 14 at
 

179
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,430
torches here that's light level 14 at
the torch down one blocks 1312 above the

180
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,440
the torch down one blocks 1312 above the
 

181

two instead of just one like air does so

184
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:41,740
two instead of just one like air does so
 

185
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,370

it would actually be 11 directly below

186
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,380
it would actually be 11 directly below
 

187
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:54,330
it would actually be 11 directly below
at this point here 11 10 9 so I could go

188
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,340
at this point here 11 10 9 so I could go
 

189
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
at this point here 11 10 9 so I could go
on other two blocks covered with water

190
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,350
on other two blocks covered with water
 

191
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,460
on other two blocks covered with water
and it still wanted to grass still

192
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,470
and it still wanted to grass still
 

193
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,020

wouldn't die if it was covered by water

194
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,030
wouldn't die if it was covered by water
 

195
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,960
wouldn't die if it was covered by water
at this light level that's good to know

196
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:05,970
at this light level that's good to know
 

197
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:13,250
at this light level that's good to know
so I'll have glowstone in the ceiling

198
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,260

 

199
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,390

here it's gonna cover over everything

258
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:10,420
here it's gonna cover over everything

below so above some of the spawning pads
 

261
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,230

the ones on the outside it's only gonna
 

263
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,130
the ones on the outside it's only gonna
be too high two blocks high and the

be too high two blocks high and the
 

265
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,330
be too high two blocks high and the
middle ones at 73 blocks high will have

spawning again you don't really need

274
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,390
spawning again you don't really need
 

275
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,170
spawning again you don't really need
this feature I don't think I don't even

276
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,180
this feature I don't think I don't even
 

277
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,050
this feature I don't think I don't even
really need it but if you want to do it

278
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,060
really need it but if you want to do it
 

279
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:53,490
really need it but if you want to do it
it's up to you somebody told me another

280
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,500
it's up to you somebody told me another
 

281
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,730
it's up to you somebody told me another
day that squid have their own mob limit

282
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:56,740
day that squid have their own mob limit
 

283
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,260
day that squid have their own mob limit
of 8 and I agree with that seems to make

284
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,270
of 8 and I agree with that seems to make
 

285
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,010
of 8 and I agree with that seems to make
sense when you're moving around though

286
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,020
sense when you're moving around though
 

287

you'll have a lot of mobs like you might

288
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,870
you'll have a lot of mobs like you might
 

289
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,790
you'll have a lot of mobs like you might
see

290
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
see
 

291
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,829
see
over 40 or so that's because there's a

292
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
over 40 or so that's because there's a
 

293
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,079
over 40 or so that's because there's a
lot of ocean around when it tries to

294
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:16,089
lot of ocean around when it tries to
 

295
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,180
lot of ocean around when it tries to
place them

296
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,190
place them
 

297
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,490
place them
it'll place a bunch there's lots of

298
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,500
it'll place a bunch there's lots of
 

299
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,320
it'll place a bunch there's lots of
spots available because what it what the

300
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,330
spots available because what it what the
 

301
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,769
spots available because what it what the
game does when it's placing the mobs

302
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:24,779
game does when it's placing the mobs
 

303
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,550
game does when it's placing the mobs
it'll go through all the chunks every

304
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,560
it'll go through all the chunks every
 

305
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:37,620
it'll go through all the chunks every
cycle and they'll it was my awesome

306
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:37,630
cycle and they'll it was my awesome
 

307
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,250
cycle and they'll it was my awesome
explaining skills again yeah so like for

308
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,260
explaining skills again yeah so like for
 

309
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,519
explaining skills again yeah so like for
every cycle if the mob count is below

310
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:47,529
every cycle if the mob count is below
 

311
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,370
every cycle if the mob count is below
the mob limits then it will try Place

312
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:50,380
the mob limits then it will try Place
 

313
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,320
the mob limits then it will try Place
mobs and it will go through all the

314
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,330
mobs and it will go through all the
 

315
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,000
mobs and it will go through all the
chunks and if at that chunk they're able

316
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,010
chunks and if at that chunk they're able
 

317
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,720
chunks and if at that chunk they're able
to place mobs they will and it's

318
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:00,730
to place mobs they will and it's
 

319
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,519
to place mobs they will and it's
possible that they could place mobs in

320
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,529
possible that they could place mobs in
 

321
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,220
possible that they could place mobs in
every single chunk if it picks the right

322
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,230
every single chunk if it picks the right
 

323
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,440
every single chunk if it picks the right
place every one of those chunks but

324
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,450
place every one of those chunks but
 

325
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,620
place every one of those chunks but
that's unlikely but if you have lots of

326
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:10,630
that's unlikely but if you have lots of
 

327
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,240
that's unlikely but if you have lots of
ocean it's more likely that they will

328
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,250
ocean it's more likely that they will
 

329
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,780
ocean it's more likely that they will
find a spot for the squid to spawn and

330
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:17,790
find a spot for the squid to spawn and
 

331
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,980
find a spot for the squid to spawn and
then it will place some and it can place

332
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:22,990
then it will place some and it can place
 

333
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,150
then it will place some and it can place
as many as it wants in that cycle and

334
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,160
as many as it wants in that cycle and
 

335
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,360
as many as it wants in that cycle and
then you might have 40 squid after that

336
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,370
then you might have 40 squid after that
 

337
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,660
then you might have 40 squid after that
one cycle which is above the limit of

338
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,670
one cycle which is above the limit of
 

339
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,540
one cycle which is above the limit of
eight assuming that's what it is so the

340
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,550
eight assuming that's what it is so the
 

341
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,880
eight assuming that's what it is so the
next cycle it won't try to place any

342
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:38,890
next cycle it won't try to place any
 

343
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,690
next cycle it won't try to place any
mobs because it's above that limit so

344
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:42,700
mobs because it's above that limit so
 

345
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,449
mobs because it's above that limit so
when you're exploring new areas it's

346
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:45,459
when you're exploring new areas it's
 

347
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,000
when you're exploring new areas it's
likely that you like this common that

348
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,010
likely that you like this common that
 

349
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,530
likely that you like this common that
you'll see lots of squid but if you're

350
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:49,540
you'll see lots of squid but if you're
 

351
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,650
you'll see lots of squid but if you're
in that area for a long time number of

352
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:52,660
in that area for a long time number of
 

353
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,470
in that area for a long time number of
squid seems to dwindle down to around

354
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,480
squid seems to dwindle down to around
 

355
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:05,019
squid seems to dwindle down to around
eight or so maybe slightly higher

356
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:05,029

 

357
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,350

and I don't know I'm rambling about that

358
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:08,360
and I don't know I'm rambling about that
 

359
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,699
and I don't know I'm rambling about that
it's really late here I'm just trying to

360
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:10,709
it's really late here I'm just trying to
 

361
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,119
it's really late here I'm just trying to
feel time in this episode I guess you

362
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:14,129
feel time in this episode I guess you
 

363
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,160
feel time in this episode I guess you
could say so that I can get it out

364
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,170
could say so that I can get it out
 

365
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,509
could say so that I can get it out
tonight otherwise it's gonna be another

366
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
tonight otherwise it's gonna be another
 

367
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,629
tonight otherwise it's gonna be another
day without Minecraft ok that's done

368
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:25,639

 

369
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:37,850

sweet just below the clouds and it's

370
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:37,860
sweet just below the clouds and it's
 

371
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,869
sweet just below the clouds and it's
really dark under here now so our next

372
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:44,879
really dark under here now so our next
 

373
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,410
really dark under here now so our next
step will be will have walls out here

374
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,420
step will be will have walls out here
 

375
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,290
step will be will have walls out here
I'm not really sure I'm gonna use I'm

376
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm not really sure I'm gonna use I'm
 

377
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,379
I'm not really sure I'm gonna use I'm
guessing sandstone and above every

378
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:57,389
guessing sandstone and above every
 

379
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,139
guessing sandstone and above every
center of these pads there'll be a hole

380
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:00,149
center of these pads there'll be a hole
 

381
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:10,460
center of these pads there'll be a hole
that water to flow down to flood it so

382
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,470
that water to flow down to flood it so
 

383
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,210
that water to flow down to flood it so
I'm gonna work on that have to come up

384
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,220
I'm gonna work on that have to come up
 

385
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,650
I'm gonna work on that have to come up
with some pattern for the post stone

386
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:17,660
with some pattern for the post stone
 

387
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,590
with some pattern for the post stone
probably try to place four for every pad

388
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
probably try to place four for every pad
 

389
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,769
probably try to place four for every pad
for glowstone for a pad type of ink

390
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:23,779
for glowstone for a pad type of ink
 

391
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,569
for glowstone for a pad type of ink
evenly spaced and I'll see you in a few

392
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:29,579
evenly spaced and I'll see you in a few
 

393
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:35,210
evenly spaced and I'll see you in a few
minutes as I work this out a bit so

394
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:35,220
minutes as I work this out a bit so
 

395
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,999
minutes as I work this out a bit so
we're up here again I'm thinking we're

396
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,009
we're up here again I'm thinking we're
 

397
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,400
we're up here again I'm thinking we're
gonna work on setting up our water

398
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,410
gonna work on setting up our water
 

399
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,499
gonna work on setting up our water
shut-off system and I believe we're

400
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:45,509
shut-off system and I believe we're
 

401
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,600
shut-off system and I believe we're
gonna use one water bucket per for every

402
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,610
gonna use one water bucket per for every
 

403
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,400
gonna use one water bucket per for every
two spawning pads so these are the

404
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,410
two spawning pads so these are the
 

405
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,740
two spawning pads so these are the
centers everywhere I have these uh

406
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:57,750
centers everywhere I have these uh
 

407
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,699
centers everywhere I have these uh
blocks missing I think they'll work best

408
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:01,709
blocks missing I think they'll work best
 

409
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,679
blocks missing I think they'll work best
if we have a regular piston over here

410
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:05,689
if we have a regular piston over here
 

411
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:11,730
if we have a regular piston over here
and water being held in place

412
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:11,740
and water being held in place
 

413
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,480
and water being held in place
in here and when released it will flow

414
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,490
in here and when released it will flow
 

415
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,490
in here and when released it will flow
to the two holes because it's in the

416
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:17,500
to the two holes because it's in the
 

417
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,180
to the two holes because it's in the
center of both of them and when the

418
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,190
center of both of them and when the
 

419
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:31,640
center of both of them and when the
piston is powered it'll shut it off

420
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,650

 

421
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:38,100

that's the way we'll do it whoo I felt

422
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,110
that's the way we'll do it whoo I felt
 

423
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:45,380
that's the way we'll do it whoo I felt
my damn leg when I shut that water off

424
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,390

 

425
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,070

yeah so for all the outside ones just in

426
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,080
yeah so for all the outside ones just in
 

427
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:58,050
yeah so for all the outside ones just in
their water held there you really don't

428
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,060
their water held there you really don't
 

429
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:09,230
their water held there you really don't
need much to it this is pretty simple

430
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,240

 

431
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,350

those animals are really annoying and

432
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360

 

433
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:28,230

one more here two three four I thought

434
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
one more here two three four I thought
 

435
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,730
one more here two three four I thought
we were gonna do the mob spawning today

436
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:29,740
we were gonna do the mob spawning today
 

437
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,890
we were gonna do the mob spawning today
or the mob sorting but I don't think

438
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:31,900
or the mob sorting but I don't think
 

439
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,290
or the mob sorting but I don't think
that's gonna happen

440
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,300
that's gonna happen
 

441
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:43,530
that's gonna happen
at this rate okay so now we have yes

442
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:43,540
at this rate okay so now we have yes
 

443
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,820
at this rate okay so now we have yes
there's only five more holes left and

444
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:47,830
there's only five more holes left and
 

445
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,250
there's only five more holes left and
this one is if we place water here I'll

446
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:53,260
this one is if we place water here I'll
 

447
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,519
this one is if we place water here I'll
cover three of the holes

448
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:58,529

 

449
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:05,730

so maybe we'll do that oh but you know

450
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:05,740
so maybe we'll do that oh but you know
 

451
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,889
so maybe we'll do that oh but you know
what

452
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:06,899
what
 

453
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,150
what
no yeah that'll work that will work

454
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
no yeah that'll work that will work
 

455
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:25,249
no yeah that'll work that will work
pretty sure or no no it's nothing work

456
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:25,259

 

457
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:31,319

hmm yeah we don't really want that

458
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:31,329
hmm yeah we don't really want that
 

459
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,329
hmm yeah we don't really want that
though because it's gonna wreck our

460
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:33,339
though because it's gonna wreck our
 

461
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:51,299
though because it's gonna wreck our
wiring yeah do that and 20 here but if

462
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:51,309
wiring yeah do that and 20 here but if
 

463
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:56,400
wiring yeah do that and 20 here but if
that's and we'll have one final one over

464
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,410
that's and we'll have one final one over
 

465
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,189
that's and we'll have one final one over
here do have redstone on me not much it

466
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:02,199
here do have redstone on me not much it
 

467
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:14,420
here do have redstone on me not much it
should be close to enough

468
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,430

 

469
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,090

I wonder what the best way of doing this

470
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,100
I wonder what the best way of doing this
 

471
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:31,670
I wonder what the best way of doing this
would have been okay I'll finish this up

472
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
would have been okay I'll finish this up
 

473
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
would have been okay I'll finish this up
this is getting really boring and then

474
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:33,930
this is getting really boring and then
 

475
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,280
this is getting really boring and then
we will be back I got this wired now

476
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,290
we will be back I got this wired now
 

477
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,090
we will be back I got this wired now
didn't use too much redstone so the

478
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,100
didn't use too much redstone so the
 

479
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,600
didn't use too much redstone so the
controls gonna be on the side here and

480

redstone powers this one signal flows
goes to the very center one here splits

484
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,180
goes to the very center one here splits
 

485
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,930
goes to the very center one here splits
off to the right and left right 1 hours

486
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:02,940
off to the right and left right 1 hours
 

487
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,079
off to the right and left right 1 hours
this piston here also goes off to the

488
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,089
this piston here also goes off to the
 

489
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,720
this piston here also goes off to the
side and it also goes no it ends there

490
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,730
side and it also goes no it ends there
 

491
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,130
side and it also goes no it ends there
this side goes off that way powers this

492
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,140
this side goes off that way powers this
 

493
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,610
this side goes off that way powers this
one here this wire here powers this and

494
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:19,620
one here this wire here powers this and
 

495
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,220
one here this wire here powers this and
it keeps going here to this very far one

496
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,230
it keeps going here to this very far one
 

497
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,560
it keeps going here to this very far one
it's a very minimal requirements for

498
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,570
it's a very minimal requirements for
 

499
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,620
it's a very minimal requirements for
this and one of my goals was keeping

500
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:30,630
this and one of my goals was keeping
 

501
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,620
this and one of my goals was keeping
this all within 2 Box high that's why I

502
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:33,630
this all within 2 Box high that's why I
 

503
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,510
this all within 2 Box high that's why I
have the repeaters like this to send

504
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
have the repeaters like this to send
 

505
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,160
have the repeaters like this to send
power through this block to the other

506
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,170
power through this block to the other
 

507
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,040
power through this block to the other
side because I need this open because

508
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,050
side because I need this open because
 

509
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,310
side because I need this open because
water flows through here that's how we

510
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
water flows through here that's how we
 

511
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,310
water flows through here that's how we
get our redstone wire over our wire

512
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,320
get our redstone wire over our wire
 

513
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,930
get our redstone wire over our wire
that's how we get our redstone wire over

514
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:53,940
that's how we get our redstone wire over
 

515
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,440
that's how we get our redstone wire over
our water stream within two blocks

516
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,450
our water stream within two blocks
 

517
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,250
our water stream within two blocks
height switch it really likes a game

518
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,260
height switch it really likes a game
 

519
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,020
height switch it really likes a game
when you switch it because that's a lot

520
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,030
when you switch it because that's a lot
 

521
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,750
when you switch it because that's a lot
of water currents to update

522
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760

 

523
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,320

for about 30 seconds to a minute then it

524
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,330
for about 30 seconds to a minute then it
 

525
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,980
for about 30 seconds to a minute then it
seems to settle down now it's now it's

526
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:16,990
seems to settle down now it's now it's
 

527
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,680
seems to settle down now it's now it's
pretty much settled yeah

528
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:22,690
pretty much settled yeah
 

529
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,980
pretty much settled yeah
pretty simple oh damn stealing all my

530
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:25,990
pretty simple oh damn stealing all my
 

531
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:39,930
pretty simple oh damn stealing all my
grass you know yeah I don't have to

532
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:39,940
grass you know yeah I don't have to
 

533
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,870
grass you know yeah I don't have to
glowstone up yet so the grass will die

534
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
glowstone up yet so the grass will die
 

535
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
glowstone up yet so the grass will die
like this

536
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,490
like this
 

537
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:51,050
like this
pretty quickly

538
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:51,060

 

539
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:58,650

brutal alright so we need glowstone in

540
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:58,660
brutal alright so we need glowstone in
 

541
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:08,460
brutal alright so we need glowstone in
here see diagonally how should we space

542
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:08,470
here see diagonally how should we space
 

543
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:15,270
here see diagonally how should we space
it this is a center it's one two three

544
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
it this is a center it's one two three
 

545
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,760
it this is a center it's one two three
four five seven block gap between holes

546
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:22,770
four five seven block gap between holes
 

547
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:30,110
four five seven block gap between holes
in some places oh it's eight

548
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,120

 

549
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,560

so I think maybe we'll just have

550
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:36,570
so I think maybe we'll just have
 

551
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,360
so I think maybe we'll just have
redstone the second block out diagonally

552
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,370
redstone the second block out diagonally
 

553
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,850
redstone the second block out diagonally
from the center so one here one here one

554
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:48,860
from the center so one here one here one
 

555
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,680
from the center so one here one here one
here and one here on all spawning pads

556
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,690
here and one here on all spawning pads
 

557
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,080
here and one here on all spawning pads
thinking maybe I'll try that out and

558
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,090
thinking maybe I'll try that out and
 

559
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,000
thinking maybe I'll try that out and
then we will be back I'm gonna make a

560
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,010
then we will be back I'm gonna make a
 

561
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:11,750
then we will be back I'm gonna make a
backup first all right so this is what

562
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
backup first all right so this is what
 

563
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,500
backup first all right so this is what
the glowstone looks like space like that

564
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:14,510
the glowstone looks like space like that
 

565
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,299
the glowstone looks like space like that
I'm pretty happy with it looks okay to

566
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:17,309
I'm pretty happy with it looks okay to
 

567
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,269
I'm pretty happy with it looks okay to
me let me know what you guys think I do

568
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:23,279
me let me know what you guys think I do
 

569
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,570
me let me know what you guys think I do
have a backup in case I wanna change my

570
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:26,580
have a backup in case I wanna change my
 

571
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,279
have a backup in case I wanna change my
mind

572
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:31,289

 

573
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,250

yeah it should work good

574
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,260
yeah it should work good
 

575
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,990
yeah it should work good
most of the grasses grown back now that

576
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,000
most of the grasses grown back now that
 

577
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,340
most of the grasses grown back now that
died from the water now that we have the

578
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,350
died from the water now that we have the
 

579
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:47,490
died from the water now that we have the
glowstone it shouldn't die it looks like

580
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:47,500
glowstone it shouldn't die it looks like
 

581
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,100
glowstone it shouldn't die it looks like
with them all flowing it will mess up

582
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,110
with them all flowing it will mess up
 

583
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,320
with them all flowing it will mess up
the water patterns below which will

584
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,330
the water patterns below which will
 

585
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,799
the water patterns below which will
likely trap animals in the system at the

586
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:58,809
likely trap animals in the system at the
 

587
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,220
likely trap animals in the system at the
time this is not a feature I really

588
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,230
time this is not a feature I really
 

589
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,899
time this is not a feature I really
intend on using all the time if at all

590
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:06,909
intend on using all the time if at all
 

591
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,870
intend on using all the time if at all
ever if I do want to switch Basset mob

592
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
ever if I do want to switch Basset mob
 

593
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,419
ever if I do want to switch Basset mob
spawning off it'll probably for probably

594
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:15,429
spawning off it'll probably for probably
 

595
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,269
spawning off it'll probably for probably
be for long periods of time and as soon

596
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:18,279
be for long periods of time and as soon
 

597
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,310
be for long periods of time and as soon
as I walk away from this area any mobs

598
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
as I walk away from this area any mobs
 

599
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,440
as I walk away from this area any mobs
that are stuck up here will be spawn

600
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,450
that are stuck up here will be spawn
 

601
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,750
that are stuck up here will be spawn
actually I don't even have to leave the

602
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
actually I don't even have to leave the
 

603
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,899
actually I don't even have to leave the
area because on these spawning pads my

604
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:32,909
area because on these spawning pads my
 

605
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,760
area because on these spawning pads my
y-coordinate is 102 and down by the EMP

606
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:38,770
y-coordinate is 102 and down by the EMP
 

607
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:47,299
y-coordinate is 102 and down by the EMP
units is this 71 so it's about 31 blocks

608
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:47,309
units is this 71 so it's about 31 blocks
 

609
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:52,139
units is this 71 so it's about 31 blocks
above that mobs despawn if they're 32

610
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:52,149
above that mobs despawn if they're 32
 

611
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,450
above that mobs despawn if they're 32
blocks away from you 3 dimensional space

612
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:54,460
blocks away from you 3 dimensional space
 

613
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,950
blocks away from you 3 dimensional space
so they should be spawn if I'm on the

614
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
so they should be spawn if I'm on the
 

615
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,740
so they should be spawn if I'm on the
EMP I guess will be a little bit lower

616
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:03,750
EMP I guess will be a little bit lower
 

617
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,659
EMP I guess will be a little bit lower
there'll be about 27 28 blocks above me

618
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:09,669
there'll be about 27 28 blocks above me
 

619
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:14,700
there'll be about 27 28 blocks above me
and if I'm slightly sideways from them

620
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,710
and if I'm slightly sideways from them
 

621
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,430
and if I'm slightly sideways from them
they will be over 32 blocks away

622
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
they will be over 32 blocks away
 

623
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,380
they will be over 32 blocks away
so they'll despawn if they're stuck up

624
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,390
so they'll despawn if they're stuck up
 

625
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,330
so they'll despawn if they're stuck up
here even if I'm in the area but yeah

626
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:24,340
here even if I'm in the area but yeah
 

627
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,529
here even if I'm in the area but yeah
it's a feature I don't really plan on

628
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:25,539
it's a feature I don't really plan on
 

629
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,769
it's a feature I don't really plan on
using much if at all ever but it's nice

630
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:28,779
using much if at all ever but it's nice
 

631
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,570
using much if at all ever but it's nice
to have just in case I need it for

632
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:30,580
to have just in case I need it for
 

633
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,780
to have just in case I need it for
something

634
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:33,790

 

635
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,720

all right so let's shut it off cool

636
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:37,730
all right so let's shut it off cool
 

637
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,610
all right so let's shut it off cool
thing is the glowstone lights it up here

638
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:39,620
thing is the glowstone lights it up here
 

639
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,960
thing is the glowstone lights it up here
and it also lights it up below so

640
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:42,970
and it also lights it up below so
 

641
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,200
and it also lights it up below so
double-double function and all these

642
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,210
double-double function and all these
 

643
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,670
double-double function and all these
water screens are thought out now I

644
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:50,680
water screens are thought out now I
 

645
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,180
water screens are thought out now I
thought them

646
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,190
thought them
 

647
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,650
thought them
we do need sidewalls for here I'll do

648
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:56,660
we do need sidewalls for here I'll do
 

649
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,240
we do need sidewalls for here I'll do
that

650
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,250
that
 

651
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,620
that
off-camera after this episode let me

652
00:22:59,620 --> 00:22:59,630
off-camera after this episode let me
 

653
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,900
off-camera after this episode let me
know if I should use cobblestone if I

654
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:01,910
know if I should use cobblestone if I
 

655
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,990
know if I should use cobblestone if I
should use sandstone I should use snow

656
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,000
should use sandstone I should use snow
 

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,270
should use sandstone I should use snow
tell me what you think or any other

658
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
tell me what you think or any other
 

659
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:17,110
tell me what you think or any other
block for the sides yeah so water pulls

660
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
block for the sides yeah so water pulls
 

661
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,600
block for the sides yeah so water pulls
them all to the center and then they

662
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,610
them all to the center and then they
 

663
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,130
them all to the center and then they
fall down that three wide hole there

664
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,140
fall down that three wide hole there
 

665
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,780
fall down that three wide hole there
they'll try to fight it a little bit but

666
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:28,790
they'll try to fight it a little bit but
 

667
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:34,440
they'll try to fight it a little bit but
they can't forever

668
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,450

 

669
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,630

not sure if having ice below would make

670
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:37,640
not sure if having ice below would make
 

671
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,180
not sure if having ice below would make
that better and I don't know if it's

672
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,190
that better and I don't know if it's
 

673
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,770
that better and I don't know if it's
really worth the hassle even if it does

674
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:43,780
really worth the hassle even if it does
 

675
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,290
really worth the hassle even if it does
but I'm kind of curious

676
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:49,300

 

677
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:58,380

okay we're gonna go down below alright

678
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,390
okay we're gonna go down below alright
 

679
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,350
okay we're gonna go down below alright
so the reason why I made the spawning

680
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
so the reason why I made the spawning
 

681
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,230
so the reason why I made the spawning
pads

682
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,240
pads
 

683
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,880
pads
bigger is because of this experiment I

684
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:05,890
bigger is because of this experiment I
 

685
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,800
bigger is because of this experiment I
did here I have the mobs falling down to

686
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:10,810
did here I have the mobs falling down to
 

687
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,600
did here I have the mobs falling down to
their death once they get to that center

688
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:12,610
their death once they get to that center
 

689
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,740
their death once they get to that center
point so they die quickly so that more

690
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:16,750
point so they die quickly so that more
 

691
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,910
point so they die quickly so that more
mob stand spot on the patch and what I

692
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:20,920
mob stand spot on the patch and what I
 

693
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,670
mob stand spot on the patch and what I
found is with only 100 spawn table

694
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:23,680
found is with only 100 spawn table
 

695
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,730
found is with only 100 spawn table
spaces the mobs just weren't spawning

696
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:29,740
spaces the mobs just weren't spawning
 

697
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,760
spaces the mobs just weren't spawning
quick enough there's only about 5 to 10

698
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:32,770
quick enough there's only about 5 to 10
 

699
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:39,410
quick enough there's only about 5 to 10
up there at once maximum and since the

700
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:39,420
up there at once maximum and since the
 

701
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,840
up there at once maximum and since the
passive mob spawning tap is bigger than

702
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:42,850
passive mob spawning tap is bigger than
 

703
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,230
passive mob spawning tap is bigger than
that let's say I don't know what it is I

704
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
that let's say I don't know what it is I
 

705
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,440
that let's say I don't know what it is I
think it's either 15 to 25 somewhere

706
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,450
think it's either 15 to 25 somewhere
 

707
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,580
think it's either 15 to 25 somewhere
around there so that's how many mobs I

708
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:53,590
around there so that's how many mobs I
 

709
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,640
around there so that's how many mobs I
want up there when I'm running this test

710
00:24:59,640 --> 00:24:59,650
want up there when I'm running this test
 

711
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,860
want up there when I'm running this test
and that's what I have now that the pads

712
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:01,870
and that's what I have now that the pads
 

713
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,270
and that's what I have now that the pads
are bigger I'm gonna kill all these

714
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,280
are bigger I'm gonna kill all these
 

715
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,070
are bigger I'm gonna kill all these
chickens otherwise you just run away

716
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
chickens otherwise you just run away
 

717
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,670
chickens otherwise you just run away
they have no way of dying at the moment

718
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:13,680

 

719
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,180

but yeah I see 3 5 there's about 15

720
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,190
but yeah I see 3 5 there's about 15
 

721
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,280
but yeah I see 3 5 there's about 15
passive mobs up there all the time

722
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,290

 

723
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,980

so it's the mob system the spawning pads

724
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,990
so it's the mob system the spawning pads
 

725
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,350
so it's the mob system the spawning pads
been keep up at this rate which is good

726
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:28,360
been keep up at this rate which is good
 

727
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,690
been keep up at this rate which is good
and once I add the mob sorting stuff

728
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:32,700
and once I add the mob sorting stuff
 

729
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,460
and once I add the mob sorting stuff
it'll take them slightly longer to die

730
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,470
it'll take them slightly longer to die
 

731
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,760
it'll take them slightly longer to die
in these EMP units because they'll have

732
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:38,770
in these EMP units because they'll have
 

733
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,540
in these EMP units because they'll have
to travel a little bit further so I'll

734
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:42,550
to travel a little bit further so I'll
 

735
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,310
to travel a little bit further so I'll
give them even more time to spawn up

736
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
give them even more time to spawn up
 

737
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,830
give them even more time to spawn up
there so at this rate it seems to be

738
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:46,840
there so at this rate it seems to be
 

739
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,290
there so at this rate it seems to be
good it's a constant stream of falling

740
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:52,300
good it's a constant stream of falling
 

741
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,140
good it's a constant stream of falling
mobs

742
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,150

 

743
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,060

and so far I haven't had any problem

744
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,070
and so far I haven't had any problem
 

745
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,250
and so far I haven't had any problem
with Bob's not spotting glitch so I

746
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:04,260
with Bob's not spotting glitch so I
 

747
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,240
with Bob's not spotting glitch so I
think building my spawning pad on the

748
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,250
think building my spawning pad on the
 

749
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,160
think building my spawning pad on the
Ford region borders is working out good

750
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,170
Ford region borders is working out good
 

751
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,540
Ford region borders is working out good
as they seem to spawn in all four

752
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:15,550
as they seem to spawn in all four
 

753
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:24,480
as they seem to spawn in all four
regions still as far as I can tell my

754
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,490
regions still as far as I can tell my
 

755
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,490
regions still as far as I can tell my
other passive mob system it would work

756
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:26,500
other passive mob system it would work
 

757
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,740
other passive mob system it would work
for about five ten minutes then it was

758
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:28,750
for about five ten minutes then it was
 

759
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,110
for about five ten minutes then it was
just stopped working for you know half

760
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
just stopped working for you know half
 

761
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,390
just stopped working for you know half
an hour to an hour and I'd have to leave

762
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,400
an hour to an hour and I'd have to leave
 

763
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,180
an hour to an hour and I'd have to leave
the area and I'll come back to get it

764
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,190
the area and I'll come back to get it
 

765
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,300
the area and I'll come back to get it
working again this one is this keeps on

766
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,310
working again this one is this keeps on
 

767
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:45,390
working again this one is this keeps on
working which is really really good I'm

768
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,400
working which is really really good I'm
 

769
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,670
working which is really really good I'm
happy about that okay so we're gonna end

770
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:50,680
happy about that okay so we're gonna end
 

771
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,110
happy about that okay so we're gonna end
it here and maybe hopefully next time

772
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
it here and maybe hopefully next time
 

773
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,530
it here and maybe hopefully next time
I'll work on the mob sorting if we do

774
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:58,540
I'll work on the mob sorting if we do
 

775
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:04,050
I'll work on the mob sorting if we do
another mob episode and I will see you

776
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,060
another mob episode and I will see you
 

777
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,030
another mob episode and I will see you
then and thank you for watching take

778
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,040
then and thank you for watching take
 

779
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,920
then and thank you for watching take
care bye bye

780
