so many
 

193
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,670

uh
 

197
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,390
uh
it was over a stack of iron blocks to do

198
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
it was over a stack of iron blocks to do
 

199
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,670
it was over a stack of iron blocks to do
all this it's crazy

200
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
all this it's crazy
 

201
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,189
all this it's crazy
but i think it's the simplest way of

202
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
but i think it's the simplest way of
 

203
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,270
but i think it's the simplest way of
doing it and in the long run it will

204
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
doing it and in the long run it will
 

205
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,189
doing it and in the long run it will
work out the best

206
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
work out the best
 

207
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,310
work out the best
uh we have only 32 string collected

208
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
uh we have only 32 string collected
 

209
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,230
uh we have only 32 string collected
so far i wonder if i

210
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240

 

211
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,469

i'm not going to check them all i wonder

212
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
i'm not going to check them all i wonder
 

213
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,430
i'm not going to check them all i wonder
if i

214
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
if i
 

215
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,270
if i
made it so some of them didn't link

216
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
made it so some of them didn't link
 

217
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,950
made it so some of them didn't link
properly

218
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
properly
 

219
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,430
properly
but yeah they spawn up at the spawner

220
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
but yeah they spawn up at the spawner
 

221
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,430
but yeah they spawn up at the spawner
there and they fall down

222
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
there and they fall down
 

223
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,270
there and they fall down
something i wanted to test last episode

224
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
something i wanted to test last episode
 

225
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,870
something i wanted to test last episode
but we never got around to it is

226
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
but we never got around to it is
 

227
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,790
but we never got around to it is
if they would fall through a film of

228
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
if they would fall through a film of
 

229
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,110
if they would fall through a film of
water like this

230
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
water like this
 

231
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,830
water like this
and it turns out they do

232
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
and it turns out they do
 

233
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,590
and it turns out they do
so i was hoping to have like a switch

234
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
so i was hoping to have like a switch
 

235
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,430
so i was hoping to have like a switch
that we could turn the water off and

236
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
that we could turn the water off and
 

237
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,870
that we could turn the water off and
and make them go through this part of

238
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
and make them go through this part of
 

239
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,870
and make them go through this part of
the the spider farm

240
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
the the spider farm
 

241
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,909
the the spider farm
but uh now they just fall through like

242
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
but uh now they just fall through like
 

243
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,629
but uh now they just fall through like
it's not there

244
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639

 

245
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,350

no matter what height they spawn it i

246
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
no matter what height they spawn it i
 

247
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,189
no matter what height they spawn it i
think one got through i hear him

248
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
think one got through i hear him
 

249
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,070
think one got through i hear him
up there what another slime got through

make it go to a chest and then have a

414
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
make it go to a chest and then have a
 

415
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,310
make it go to a chest and then have a
storage mine cart that fills up and

416
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
storage mine cart that fills up and
 

417
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,670
storage mine cart that fills up and
brings it up

418
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
brings it up
 

419
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,870
brings it up
to the surface here or to a

420
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
to the surface here or to a
 

421
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,430
to the surface here or to a
higher part in our cave and drops off

422
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
higher part in our cave and drops off
 

423
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,389
higher part in our cave and drops off
all the string there somewhere

424
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
all the string there somewhere
 

425
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,070
all the string there somewhere
and then sends the storage minecart back

426
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
and then sends the storage minecart back
 

427
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,750
and then sends the storage minecart back
down to get refilled

428
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
down to get refilled
 

429
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,590
down to get refilled
that way i don't have to go down into

430
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
that way i don't have to go down into
 

431
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,829
that way i don't have to go down into
this nasty pit to pick up string when i

432
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
this nasty pit to pick up string when i
 

433
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,790
this nasty pit to pick up string when i
need it

434
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
need it
 

435
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,310
need it
and when we get enough string we should

436
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
and when we get enough string we should
 

437
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,630
and when we get enough string we should
be able to finish up the gold farm

438
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
be able to finish up the gold farm
 

439
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,670
be able to finish up the gold farm
i think although i need iron now

440
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
i think although i need iron now
 

441
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,150
i think although i need iron now
because i used it all but for today i

442
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
because i used it all but for today i
 

443
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,110
because i used it all but for today i
think that

444
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
think that
 

445
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,070
think that
the main project i want to work on is

446
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
the main project i want to work on is
 

447
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,030
the main project i want to work on is
this area

448
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
this area
 

449
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,150
this area
here we should work on this a bit

450
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
here we should work on this a bit
 

451
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,750
here we should work on this a bit
uh first off let's try to

452
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
uh first off let's try to
 

453
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,509
uh first off let's try to
define the shape of this room a little

454
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
define the shape of this room a little
 

455
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,389
define the shape of this room a little
bit better we have this thing here

456
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
bit better we have this thing here
 

457
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,910
bit better we have this thing here
we should match the shape of this but

458
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
we should match the shape of this but
 

459
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,150
we should match the shape of this but
like if we go up here for example this

460
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
like if we go up here for example this
 

461
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,190
like if we go up here for example this
is what we're

462
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
is what we're
 

463
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,389
is what we're
we're trying to copy have a three wide

464
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
we're trying to copy have a three wide
 

465
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,190

grass path and then wood on both sides i

466
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
grass path and then wood on both sides i
 

467
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,630
grass path and then wood on both sides i
think

468
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
think
 

469
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,190
think
so like for here it's easy

470
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
so like for here it's easy
 

471
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,150
so like for here it's easy
just count out three and we want wood

472
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
just count out three and we want wood
 

473
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,790
just count out three and we want wood
here right

474
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
here right
 

475

478
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
uh let's go does it look bad if we do
 

479
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,910
uh let's go does it look bad if we do
this

480
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920

 

481
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,150

i think that's too narrow yeah i think

482
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
i think that's too narrow yeah i think
 

483
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,310
i think that's too narrow yeah i think

the idea is i want to be able to bring

510
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
the idea is i want to be able to bring
 

511
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,430
the idea is i want to be able to bring
my horses down here

512
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
my horses down here
 

513
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,310
my horses down here
and then have like have this like a

514
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
and then have like have this like a
 

515
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,949
and then have like have this like a
parking

516
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
parking
 

517
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,470
parking
lot almost to have a two wide

518
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
lot almost to have a two wide
 

519
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,790
lot almost to have a two wide
door entrance i can i can ride in with

520
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
door entrance i can i can ride in with
 

521
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,829
door entrance i can i can ride in with
the horse

522
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839

 

523
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,630

ride in and then the horse gets locked

524
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
ride in and then the horse gets locked
 

525
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,910
ride in and then the horse gets locked
up

526
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
up
 

527
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,030
up
and when i press shift i can walk out

528
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
and when i press shift i can walk out
 

529
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,590
and when i press shift i can walk out
without the horse being able to get out

530
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
without the horse being able to get out
 

531
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,269
without the horse being able to get out
and without the horse suffocating or

532
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
and without the horse suffocating or
 

533
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,190
and without the horse suffocating or
anything like that and then i want to

534
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
anything like that and then i want to
 

535
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,990
anything like that and then i want to
make it

536
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
make it
 

537
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,990
make it
easy so that i can just right click on

538
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
easy so that i can just right click on
 

539
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,630
easy so that i can just right click on
the horse

540
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
the horse
 

541
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,630
the horse
door opens and i can back the horse out

542
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
door opens and i can back the horse out
 

543
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,870
door opens and i can back the horse out
real real simple

544
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
real real simple
 

545
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,910
real real simple
one thing i've learned already uh when i

546
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
one thing i've learned already uh when i
 

547
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,550
one thing i've learned already uh when i
do this

548
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
do this
 

549
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,430
do this
this is not enough head room i hit my

550
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
this is not enough head room i hit my
 

551
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,110
this is not enough head room i hit my
head if it's only three high

552
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
head if it's only three high
 

553
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,550
head if it's only three high
when i get off the horse uh maybe we'll

554
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
when i get off the horse uh maybe we'll
 

555
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,550
when i get off the horse uh maybe we'll
go

556
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
go
 

557
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,470
go
go up to the surface so and just work

558
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
go up to the surface so and just work
 

559
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,990
go up to the surface so and just work
out a little design for it

560
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000

 

561
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,470

is it night oh it's night okay one sec

562
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480

 

563
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,949

yeah so let's try to design some kind of

564
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
yeah so let's try to design some kind of
 

565
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,550
yeah so let's try to design some kind of
stall for

566
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
stall for
 

567
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,470
stall for
parking horses i was thinking something

568
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
parking horses i was thinking something
 

569
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,990
parking horses i was thinking something
like this is probably about

570
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
like this is probably about
 

571
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,990
like this is probably about
all we would need uh

572
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
all we would need uh
 

573
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,430
all we would need uh
because they just need like a two by two

574
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
because they just need like a two by two
 

575
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,870
because they just need like a two by two
space oh hello uh

576
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
space oh hello uh
 

577
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,110
space oh hello uh
you know it goes day and it's really not

578
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
you know it goes day and it's really not
 

579
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,990
you know it goes day and it's really not
safe around here

580
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
safe around here
 

581
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,910
safe around here
i have so many trees in this area this

582
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
i have so many trees in this area this
 

583
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,910
i have so many trees in this area this
creeper is always

584
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
creeper is always
 

585
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,829
creeper is always
uh the main reason i haven't really been

586
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
uh the main reason i haven't really been
 

587
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,990
uh the main reason i haven't really been
using horses as much as i would like to

588
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
using horses as much as i would like to
 

589
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,710
using horses as much as i would like to
is because they're a bit of a hassle to

590
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
is because they're a bit of a hassle to
 

591
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,829
is because they're a bit of a hassle to
to to get going and to get off

592
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
to to get going and to get off
 

593
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,790
to to get going and to get off
because if you just leave them wandering

594
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
because if you just leave them wandering
 

595
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,710
because if you just leave them wandering
they take off like they'll go

596
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
they take off like they'll go
 

597
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,030
they take off like they'll go
100 200 blocks really quick and you'll

598
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
100 200 blocks really quick and you'll
 

599
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,870
100 200 blocks really quick and you'll
lose them like on the mytrex server

600
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
lose them like on the mytrex server
 

601
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,230
lose them like on the mytrex server
people are losing their horses

602
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
people are losing their horses
 

603
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,550
people are losing their horses
all the time because you just hop off

604
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
all the time because you just hop off
 

605
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,310
all the time because you just hop off
and

606
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
and
 

607
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,350
and
they wander you can turn around 15

608
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
they wander you can turn around 15
 

609
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,110
they wander you can turn around 15
seconds later and they're gone and you

610
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
seconds later and they're gone and you
 

611
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,190
seconds later and they're gone and you
have to go find them

612
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
have to go find them
 

613
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,230
have to go find them
it's pretty crazy so if i set up like a

614
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
it's pretty crazy so if i set up like a
 

615
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,069
it's pretty crazy so if i set up like a
little parking stalls every

616
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
little parking stalls every
 

617
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,750
little parking stalls every
so often my world that would be really

618
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
so often my world that would be really
 

619
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,069
so often my world that would be really
cool uh so a horse

620
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
cool uh so a horse
 

621
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,710
cool uh so a horse
i don't think can get through that

622
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720

 

623
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,870

just gotta figure out oh which which

624
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
just gotta figure out oh which which
 

625
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,550
just gotta figure out oh which which
side is it this side okay so they can't

626
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
side is it this side okay so they can't
 

627
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,430
side is it this side okay so they can't
get through that for sure

628
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
get through that for sure
 

629
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,949
get through that for sure
uh let's try go a little bit higher

630
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959

 

631
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,310

all right so they can't get through that

632
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
all right so they can't get through that
 

633
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,470
all right so they can't get through that
either so they're over a block and a

634
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
either so they're over a block and a
 

635
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,030
either so they're over a block and a
half tall

636
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040

 

637
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,150

and they should be able to get through

638
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
and they should be able to get through
 

639
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,470
and they should be able to get through
this yeah okay

640
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
this yeah okay
 

641
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,590
this yeah okay
so i think um

642
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600

 

643
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,870

actually you know i think the best way

644
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
actually you know i think the best way
 

645
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,190
actually you know i think the best way
of doing it making like a door for them

646
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
of doing it making like a door for them
 

647
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,150
of doing it making like a door for them
is just have one block like that they

648
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
is just have one block like that they
 

649
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,430
is just have one block like that they
won't be able to get through that on

650
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
won't be able to get through that on
 

651
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,069
won't be able to get through that on
their own

652
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
their own
 

653
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,829
their own
like have a piston come up out of the

654
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
like have a piston come up out of the
 

655
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,670
like have a piston come up out of the
ground or something that that pushes the

656
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
ground or something that that pushes the
 

657
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,710
ground or something that that pushes the
block up

658
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
block up
 

659
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,110
block up
if we get off the horse we can still

660
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
if we get off the horse we can still
 

661
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,790
if we get off the horse we can still
walk out of that

662
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
walk out of that
 

663
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,230
walk out of that
and then we need to make it so that when

664
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
and then we need to make it so that when
 

665
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,550
and then we need to make it so that when
we hop on the horse that block goes down

666
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
we hop on the horse that block goes down
 

667
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,910
we hop on the horse that block goes down
ideally

668
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
ideally
 

669
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,189
ideally
if we can do something like that um

670
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
if we can do something like that um
 

671
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,430
if we can do something like that um
that would involve doing using trip

672
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
that would involve doing using trip
 

673
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,870
that would involve doing using trip
hooks though

674
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
hooks though
 

675
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,430
hooks though
i call them trip hooks i don't tripwire

676
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
i call them trip hooks i don't tripwire
 

677
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,629
i call them trip hooks i don't tripwire
hook

678
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
hook
 

679
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,750
hook
uh so i just

680
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760

 

681
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,949

i wish you could make these a little

682
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
i wish you could make these a little
 

683
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,350
i wish you could make these a little
more compact i think we would have to do

684
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
more compact i think we would have to do
 

685
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,150
more compact i think we would have to do
something like this

686
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
something like this
 

687
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,430
something like this
get these like this

688
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
get these like this
 

689
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,350
get these like this
and if if this is

690
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
and if if this is
 

691
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,629
and if if this is
tripped make the piston go down

692
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639

 

693
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,870

yeah well no that doesn't work because

694
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
yeah well no that doesn't work because
 

695
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,990
yeah well no that doesn't work because
how am i going to get the

696
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
how am i going to get the
 

697
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,389
how am i going to get the
horse in here if that's up

698
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399

 

699
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,110

man this is a tough problem maybe i got

700
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
man this is a tough problem maybe i got
 

701
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,870
man this is a tough problem maybe i got
to use a t-flip flop or something for

702
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
to use a t-flip flop or something for
 

703
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,350
to use a t-flip flop or something for
this

704
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
this
 

705
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,310
this
i'll mess with it for a sec here yeah so

706
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
i'll mess with it for a sec here yeah so
 

707
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,310
i'll mess with it for a sec here yeah so
t-flip-flop is definitely the way to go

708
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
t-flip-flop is definitely the way to go
 

709
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,910
t-flip-flop is definitely the way to go
with this i think it seems to work out

710
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
with this i think it seems to work out
 

711
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,030
with this i think it seems to work out
pretty good uh had a creeper blast just

712
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
pretty good uh had a creeper blast just
 

713
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,430
pretty good uh had a creeper blast just
about

714
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
about

killed me very quick coincidentally

716
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
killed me very quick coincidentally
 

717
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,829
killed me very quick coincidentally
after talking about them

718
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
after talking about them
 

719
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,910
after talking about them
uh so check this out

720
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
uh so check this out
 

721
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,509
uh so check this out
tripwire goes to a sticky piston pushes

722
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
tripwire goes to a sticky piston pushes
 

723
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,670
tripwire goes to a sticky piston pushes
the block up

724
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
the block up
 

725
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,790
the block up
that converts it into a one tick pulse

726
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
that converts it into a one tick pulse
 

727
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,710
that converts it into a one tick pulse
which goes to another sticky piston down

728
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
which goes to another sticky piston down
 

729
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,230
which goes to another sticky piston down
here if you power

730
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
here if you power
 

731
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,790
here if you power
a sticky piston for only one tick it

732
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
a sticky piston for only one tick it
 

733
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,470
a sticky piston for only one tick it
will leave the block behind

734
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
will leave the block behind
 

735
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,790
will leave the block behind
so it's like a t flip flop and

736
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
so it's like a t flip flop and
 

737
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,829
so it's like a t flip flop and
check it out so i hop on the horse

738
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
check it out so i hop on the horse
 

739
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,870
check it out so i hop on the horse
block goes down from that stays down

740
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
block goes down from that stays down
 

741
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,949
block goes down from that stays down
until we return block goes up

742
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
until we return block goes up
 

743
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,230
until we return block goes up
hop off well i i hopped off

744
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
hop off well i i hopped off
 

745
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,470
hop off well i i hopped off
into the trip hook so something we're

746
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
into the trip hook so something we're
 

747
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,150
into the trip hook so something we're
gonna have to do with this is make sure

748
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
gonna have to do with this is make sure
 

749
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,350
gonna have to do with this is make sure
i don't uh

750
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
i don't uh
 

751
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,230
i don't uh
get off on the sides here so as long as

752
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
get off on the sides here so as long as
 

753
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,670
get off on the sides here so as long as
i make it so

754
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
i make it so
 

755
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,069
i make it so
there's no two block high space i should

756
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
there's no two block high space i should
 

757
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,430
there's no two block high space i should
be

758
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
be
 

759
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,550
be
able to prevent that from happening

760
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
able to prevent that from happening
 

761
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,509
able to prevent that from happening
let's try this try this again

762
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
let's try this try this again
 

763
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,829
let's try this try this again
alright so now we shouldn't spawn on the

764
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
alright so now we shouldn't spawn on the
 

765
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,990
alright so now we shouldn't spawn on the
sides

766
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
sides
 

767
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,230
sides
ride out return from a long journey

768
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
ride out return from a long journey
 

769
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,949
ride out return from a long journey
goes back up hop off the horse walk out

770
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
goes back up hop off the horse walk out
 

771
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,590
goes back up hop off the horse walk out
perfect so that's what i want to do the

772
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
perfect so that's what i want to do the
 

773
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,350
perfect so that's what i want to do the
only thing

774
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
only thing
 

775
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,670
only thing
oh i did not press shift i i swear

776
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
oh i did not press shift i i swear
 

777
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,870
oh i did not press shift i i swear
why did that happen that was weird

778
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
why did that happen that was weird
 

779
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,670
why did that happen that was weird
um the only thing i want to make this

780
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
um the only thing i want to make this
 

781
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,189
um the only thing i want to make this
tileable so i can't have all this

782
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
tileable so i can't have all this
 

783
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,629
tileable so i can't have all this
redstone to the side so i think

784
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
redstone to the side so i think
 

785
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,590
redstone to the side so i think
i'll try to run it to the back here and

786
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
i'll try to run it to the back here and
 

787
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,710
i'll try to run it to the back here and
also

788
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
also
 

789
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,150
also
maybe bring this in one block because we

790
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
maybe bring this in one block because we
 

791
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,189
maybe bring this in one block because we
only need the string

792
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
only need the string
 

793
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,230
only need the string
one block wide not two like this

794
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
one block wide not two like this
 

795
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,949
one block wide not two like this
and yeah

796
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
and yeah
 

797
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,470
and yeah
all right so we're gonna put a bunch of

798
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
all right so we're gonna put a bunch of
 

799
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,030
all right so we're gonna put a bunch of
these

800
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
these
 

801
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,110
these
i think like i'm gonna try and make like

802
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
i think like i'm gonna try and make like
 

803
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,550
i think like i'm gonna try and make like
eight of them i think

804
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
eight of them i think
 

805
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,069
eight of them i think
down in that room let's just go back

806
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
down in that room let's just go back
 

807
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,310
down in that room let's just go back
there

808
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
there
 

809
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,230
there
and i think that'll be really cool so

810
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
and i think that'll be really cool so
 

811
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,710
and i think that'll be really cool so
i'll be able to keep a stock of horses

812
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
i'll be able to keep a stock of horses
 

813
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,550
i'll be able to keep a stock of horses
uh like a storage room for horses

814
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
uh like a storage room for horses
 

815
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,749
uh like a storage room for horses
basically

816
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
basically
 

817
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,550
basically
in this little area um

818
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560

 

819
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,269

yes over here so i'm gonna have to move

820
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
yes over here so i'm gonna have to move
 

821
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,870
yes over here so i'm gonna have to move
all these chests

822
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
all these chests
 

823
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,430
all these chests
out of here man

824
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
out of here man
 

825
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,789
out of here man
let me show you how much stuff is here

826
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
let me show you how much stuff is here
 

827
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,429
let me show you how much stuff is here
all this i'm gonna bring an ender chest

828
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
all this i'm gonna bring an ender chest
 

829
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,630
all this i'm gonna bring an ender chest
here i think to speed it up

830
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640

 

831
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,829

man

832
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839

 

833
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,669

this used to be my main storage room

834
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
this used to be my main storage room
 

835
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,429
this used to be my main storage room
this area here for the longest time

836
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
this area here for the longest time
 

837
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,549
this area here for the longest time
before i built that

838
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
before i built that
 

839
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,270
before i built that
that shutter one up there by the furnace

840
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
that shutter one up there by the furnace
 

841
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,429
that shutter one up there by the furnace
room

842
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
room
 

843
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,150
room
um now i've been using it for bulk

844
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
um now i've been using it for bulk
 

845
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,630
um now i've been using it for bulk
storage basically

846
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
storage basically
 

847
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,310
storage basically
oh yeah and i did this by the way check

848
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
oh yeah and i did this by the way check
 

849
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,750
oh yeah and i did this by the way check
it out so

850
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
it out so
 

851
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,909
it out so
that means the walls can go on the

852
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
that means the walls can go on the
 

853
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,950
that means the walls can go on the
outside of this wood

854
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
outside of this wood
 

855
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,750
outside of this wood
anything at the wood or inside we don't

856
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
anything at the wood or inside we don't
 

857
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,390
anything at the wood or inside we don't
want to

858
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
want to
 

859
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,110
want to
put any walls and also we can hide

860
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
put any walls and also we can hide
 

861
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,630
put any walls and also we can hide
lighting

862
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
lighting
 

863
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,549
lighting
using pistons kind of like we did up

864
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
using pistons kind of like we did up
 

865
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,990
using pistons kind of like we did up
here

866
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000

 

867
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,590

so underneath each of these pistons is

868
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
so underneath each of these pistons is
 

869
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,390
so underneath each of these pistons is
yeah i can break it it is like a pumpkin

870
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
yeah i can break it it is like a pumpkin
 

871
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,669
yeah i can break it it is like a pumpkin
or something so that's

872
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
or something so that's
 

873
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,549
or something so that's
that's how i'm lighting a lot of my base

874
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
that's how i'm lighting a lot of my base
 

875
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,909
that's how i'm lighting a lot of my base
with that little trick

876
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
with that little trick
 

877
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,750
with that little trick
so we'll do the same down there and that

878
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
so we'll do the same down there and that
 

879
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,830
so we'll do the same down there and that
should allow us to get rid of a lot of

880
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
should allow us to get rid of a lot of
 

881
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,950
should allow us to get rid of a lot of
these torches

882
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960

 

883
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,830

oh man that was brutal that took over

884
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
oh man that was brutal that took over
 

885
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,549
oh man that was brutal that took over
half an hour to do

886
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
half an hour to do
 

887
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,830
half an hour to do

to uh this area here i wanted
 

905
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,990
to uh this area here i wanted
something i want to build sometime is

906
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
something i want to build sometime is
 

907
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,789
something i want to build sometime is
like a place for my bulk storage

908
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
like a place for my bulk storage
 

909
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,230
like a place for my bulk storage
like this stuff um but for now i just

910
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
like this stuff um but for now i just
 

911
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,909
like this stuff um but for now i just
put it out of the way

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
put it out of the way
 

913
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,830
put it out of the way
somewhere i can't really build or that i

914
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
somewhere i can't really build or that i
 

915
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,110
somewhere i can't really build or that i
don't really plan on building

916
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
don't really plan on building
 

917
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,470
don't really plan on building
and it's all in these chests

918
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
and it's all in these chests
 

919
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,110
and it's all in these chests
but i was like even doing like this

920
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
but i was like even doing like this
 

921
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,710
but i was like even doing like this
trick where you double clicked and

922
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
trick where you double clicked and
 

923
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,630
trick where you double clicked and
it fills your inventory instantly that

924
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
it fills your inventory instantly that
 

925
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,470
it fills your inventory instantly that
was a lifesaver

926
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
was a lifesaver
 

927
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,750
was a lifesaver
but it still took a long time

928
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
but it still took a long time
 

929
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,789
but it still took a long time
even with the speed two all these high

930
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
even with the speed two all these high
 

931
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,990
even with the speed two all these high
efficiency things and it was a big job

932
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
efficiency things and it was a big job
 

933
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,470
efficiency things and it was a big job
anyway that's done uh we can start

934
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
anyway that's done uh we can start
 

935
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,070
anyway that's done uh we can start
building our little

936
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
building our little
 

937
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,549
building our little
horse horse stalls or horse stables

938
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
horse horse stalls or horse stables
 

939
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,110
horse horse stalls or horse stables
whatever you want to call them down here

940
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
whatever you want to call them down here
 

941
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,789
whatever you want to call them down here
um okay so i want to have a path

942
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
um okay so i want to have a path
 

943
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,029
um okay so i want to have a path
here for sure uh those horse stables i

944
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
here for sure uh those horse stables i
 

945
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,230
here for sure uh those horse stables i
think are gonna

946
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
think are gonna
 

947
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,549
think are gonna
take up one two three four just for the

948
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
take up one two three four just for the
 

949
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,669
take up one two three four just for the
visual part of it

950
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
visual part of it
 

951
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,110
visual part of it
and then redstone is gonna take another

952
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
and then redstone is gonna take another
 

953
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,990
and then redstone is gonna take another
one or two blocks

954
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
one or two blocks
 

955
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,430
one or two blocks
in the back so we're pushing

956
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
in the back so we're pushing
 

957
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,830
in the back so we're pushing
we're get like if we if we put it here

958
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
we're get like if we if we put it here
 

959
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,669
we're get like if we if we put it here
uh it's going to come pretty close to

960
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
uh it's going to come pretty close to
 

961
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,270
uh it's going to come pretty close to
this path

962
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
this path
 

963
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,430
this path
so we'll either want to move it over one

964
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
so we'll either want to move it over one
 

965
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,510
so we'll either want to move it over one
more to the left i'm not sure

966
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520

 

967
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,549

but yeah uh

968
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
but yeah uh
 

969
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,190
but yeah uh
i guess actually okay here's how we're

970
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
i guess actually okay here's how we're
 

971
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,390
i guess actually okay here's how we're
going to start this we're going to go

972
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
going to start this we're going to go
 

973
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
going to start this we're going to go
down

974
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
down
 

975
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,990
down
half a slab or a full block actually

976
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
half a slab or a full block actually
 

977
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,190
half a slab or a full block actually
um let's see

978
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
um let's see
 

979
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,190
um let's see
i want to put the next one here or here

980
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
i want to put the next one here or here
 

981
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,230
i want to put the next one here or here
i think we'll go

982
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
i think we'll go
 

983
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,270
i think we'll go
here i think that's going to work out

984
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
here i think that's going to work out
 

985
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,909
here i think that's going to work out
better in the long run so we'll go down

986
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
better in the long run so we'll go down
 

987
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,990
better in the long run so we'll go down
a block

988
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
a block
 

989
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,310
a block
we'll set up grass down here i think

990
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
we'll set up grass down here i think
 

991
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,590
we'll set up grass down here i think
we'll make the path

992
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
we'll make the path
 

993
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,830
we'll make the path
only two wide instead of three like

994
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
only two wide instead of three like
 

995
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,710
only two wide instead of three like
normal

996
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
normal
 

997
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,390
normal
because i plan on putting

998
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
because i plan on putting
 

999
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,430
because i plan on putting
um oops wrong pick i plan on putting

1000
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
um oops wrong pick i plan on putting
 

1001
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,430
um oops wrong pick i plan on putting
like an elevator to the surface at the

1002
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
like an elevator to the surface at the
 

1003
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,390
like an elevator to the surface at the
end of this as well

1004
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
end of this as well
 

1005
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,430
end of this as well
to get the horses out real quick

1006
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
to get the horses out real quick
 

1007
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,470
to get the horses out real quick
and that's going to be an even number so

1008
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
and that's going to be an even number so
 

1009
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,909
and that's going to be an even number so
we should work with even numbers for

1010
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
we should work with even numbers for
 

1011
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,350
we should work with even numbers for
this part of it

1012

1015
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,830

this will go down we'll have a the log

1016
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
this will go down we'll have a the log
 

1017
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,830
this will go down we'll have a the log
staircase thing that we usually do over

1018
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
staircase thing that we usually do over
 

1019
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,149
staircase thing that we usually do over
here

1020
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
here
 

1021
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,190
here
and here this will meet up

1022
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
and here this will meet up
 

1023
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,950
and here this will meet up
this will be taken out of this will be

1024
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
this will be taken out of this will be
 

1025
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,830
this will be taken out of this will be
dirt like usual i guess this should be

1026
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
dirt like usual i guess this should be
 

1027
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,990
dirt like usual i guess this should be
wood though

1028
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
wood though
 

1029
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,990
wood though
this gonna look weird i don't know we'll

1030
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
this gonna look weird i don't know we'll
 

1031
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,990
this gonna look weird i don't know we'll
find out

1032
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
find out
 

1033
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,950
find out
okay and then this will be wood

1034
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960

 

1035
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,350

okay so that's that's gonna be our

1036
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
okay so that's that's gonna be our
 

1037
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,950
okay so that's that's gonna be our
little road for them

1038
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960

 

1039

when they changed it so slimes could
 

1045
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,990
when they changed it so slimes could
spawn below level 40. i thought it was

1046
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
spawn below level 40. i thought it was
 

1047
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,390
spawn below level 40. i thought it was
the greatest thing at first

1048
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
the greatest thing at first
 

1049

because before i was they would only
 

1055
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,070
because before i was they would only
spawn below level 16 when

1056
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
spawn below level 16 when
 

1057
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,190
spawn below level 16 when
i first started this build and now

1058
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
i first started this build and now
 

1059
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,870
i first started this build and now
they're

1060
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880

um okay so
i'm aiming to put eight of these stall

1068
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
i'm aiming to put eight of these stall
 

1069
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,510
i'm aiming to put eight of these stall
things in so this will have to go back

1070
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
things in so this will have to go back
 

1071
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,350
things in so this will have to go back
quite a ways

1072
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360

 

1073
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,710

all right grass will spread get rid of

1074
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
all right grass will spread get rid of
 

1075
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,909
all right grass will spread get rid of
all this

1076
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
all this
 

1077
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,750
all this
okay so where should we start the first

1078
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
okay so where should we start the first
 

1079
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,070
okay so where should we start the first
one um

1080
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080

 

1081
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,789

let's see one two

1082
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799

 

1083
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,029

maybe we'll put the first one here okay

1084
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
maybe we'll put the first one here okay
 

1085
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,149
maybe we'll put the first one here okay
so it's going to be

1086
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159

 

1087
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,470

this wide and i think we got to leave us

1088
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
this wide and i think we got to leave us
 

1089
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,950
this wide and i think we got to leave us
a one block space between each of them

1090
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
a one block space between each of them
 

1091
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,830
a one block space between each of them
so

1092
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840

 

1093
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,909

this is gonna get big isn't it

1094
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919

 

1095
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,789

just for the first wait wait no i did

1096
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
just for the first wait wait no i did
 

1097
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,990
just for the first wait wait no i did
that wrong

1098
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
that wrong
 

1099
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,110
that wrong
okay so one block space

1100
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
okay so one block space
 

1101
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,350
okay so one block space
second stall starts here so that just

1102
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
second stall starts here so that just
 

1103
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,870
second stall starts here so that just
for two stalls

1104
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
for two stalls
 

1105
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,310
for two stalls
all four stalls oop

1106
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320

 

1107
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,909

i have arrows in the eyes now so it

1108
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
i have arrows in the eyes now so it
 

1109
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,830
i have arrows in the eyes now so it
shoots flaming arrows and it scares me

1110
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
shoots flaming arrows and it scares me
 

1111
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,990
shoots flaming arrows and it scares me
every time

1112
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
every time
 

1113
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,909
every time
um

1114
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919

 

1115
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,830

yeah so it's going to be for four stalls

1116
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
yeah so it's going to be for four stalls
 

1117
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,590
yeah so it's going to be for four stalls
at this this length

1118
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
at this this length
 

1119
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,549
at this this length
so far and i want to do do it like this

1120
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
so far and i want to do do it like this
 

1121
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,549
so far and i want to do do it like this
we'll go up three blocks

1122
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
we'll go up three blocks
 

1123
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,390
we'll go up three blocks
hopefully we don't run into anything as

1124
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
hopefully we don't run into anything as
 

1125
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,909
hopefully we don't run into anything as
we're doing this

1126
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
we're doing this
 

1127
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,350
we're doing this
and i was thinking have

1128
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360

 

1129
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,350

have it opened up so we can see like if

1130
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
have it opened up so we can see like if
 

1131
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,870
have it opened up so we can see like if
we're in the stall i want to be able to

1132
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
we're in the stall i want to be able to
 

1133
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,669
we're in the stall i want to be able to
see the horse

1134
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
see the horse
 

1135
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,190
see the horse
to the right and left the bus if there

1136
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
to the right and left the bus if there
 

1137
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,549
to the right and left the bus if there
is one if possible

1138
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
is one if possible
 

1139
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,390
is one if possible
get this up and fence at eye level so we

1140
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
get this up and fence at eye level so we
 

1141
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,430
get this up and fence at eye level so we
can see through

1142
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
can see through
 

1143
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,190
can see through
i might even take the fence out i'm not

1144
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
i might even take the fence out i'm not
 

1145
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,750
i might even take the fence out i'm not
sure and have air space

1146
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
sure and have air space
 

1147
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,470
sure and have air space
but i was thinking of doing that

1148
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
but i was thinking of doing that
 

1149
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,390
but i was thinking of doing that
[Applause]

1150
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
[Applause]
 

1151
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,510
[Applause]
on all the sides

1152
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
on all the sides
 

1153
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,630
on all the sides
like that all right

1154
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
like that all right
 

1155
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,950
like that all right
and when we get off the horse we won't

1156
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
and when we get off the horse we won't
 

1157
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,710
and when we get off the horse we won't
be on top of here because it takes up

1158
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
be on top of here because it takes up
 

1159
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,590
be on top of here because it takes up
all the space

1160
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
all the space
 

1161
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,590
all the space
which is good that's what we want

1162
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600

 

1163
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,230

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
alright and maybe we'll put glowstone or
 

1165
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,669
alright and maybe we'll put glowstone or
something behind this

1166
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
something behind this
 

1167
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,870
something behind this
back wall side

1168
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880

 

1169
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,870

uh we will have to get rid of this
 

1173
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,669
uh we will have to get rid of this
actually for the trip wire

1174
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
actually for the trip wire
 

1175
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,710
actually for the trip wire
and this one

1176
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720

 

1177
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,750

i'm running out of stuff here

1178
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
i'm running out of stuff here
 

1179
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,710

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720

 

1181
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,310

okay so that there

1182
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
okay so that there
 

1183
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,990
okay so that there
tripwire uh this has to come out

1184
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
tripwire uh this has to come out
 

1185
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,230
tripwire uh this has to come out
up to here because it's only we will fit

1186
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
up to here because it's only we will fit
 

1187
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,590
up to here because it's only we will fit
one string in

1188
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
one string in
 

1189
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,430
one string in
which is the minimum

1190
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440

 

1191
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,669

and this is not a solid block below it

1192
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
and this is not a solid block below it
 

1193
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,590
and this is not a solid block below it
so it should still function

1194
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600

 

1195
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,950

all right so that should be it's um

1196
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
all right so that should be it's um
 

1197
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,710
all right so that should be it's um
horses are wider than one block which

1198
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
horses are wider than one block which
 

1199
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,230
horses are wider than one block which
works out really good for this build

1200
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
works out really good for this build
 

1201
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,269
works out really good for this build
because

1202
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
because
 

1203
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,950
because
no matter how i enter this thing i'm

1204
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
no matter how i enter this thing i'm
 

1205
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,870
no matter how i enter this thing i'm
gonna hit that trip wire

1206
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
gonna hit that trip wire
 

1207
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,590
gonna hit that trip wire
just because the horse isn't uh like if

1208
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
just because the horse isn't uh like if
 

1209
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,190
just because the horse isn't uh like if
i if i had the horse all the way to the

1210
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
i if i had the horse all the way to the
 

1211
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,110
i if i had the horse all the way to the
right on this side

1212
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
right on this side
 

1213
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,870
right on this side
uh i still would touch the tripwire

1214
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
uh i still would touch the tripwire
 

1215
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,390
uh i still would touch the tripwire
because i won't be

1216
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
because i won't be
 

1217
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,070
because i won't be
flush against this wall the horse will

1218
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
flush against this wall the horse will
 

1219
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,830
flush against this wall the horse will
make me kind of like this

1220
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840

 

1221
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,830

oh okay i think it'll work no problem

1222
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
oh okay i think it'll work no problem
 

1223
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,110
oh okay i think it'll work no problem
um and

1224
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
um and
 

1225
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,840
um and
then

1226
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:35,850
then
 

1227
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,029
then
[Music]

1228
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
[Music]
 

1229
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,990
[Music]
let's do it this way we'll connect to

1230
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
let's do it this way we'll connect to
 

1231
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,029
let's do it this way we'll connect to
the drip wire on

1232
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
the drip wire on
 

1233
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,830
the drip wire on
this side i almost feel i should

1234
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
this side i almost feel i should
 

1235
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:56,390
this side i almost feel i should
flip this around i'm not sure

1236
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
flip this around i'm not sure
 

1237
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,390
flip this around i'm not sure
oh okay i'm a little disorganized today

1238
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
oh okay i'm a little disorganized today
 

1239
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,110
oh okay i'm a little disorganized today
and rambling a bit just bear with me

1240
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
and rambling a bit just bear with me
 

1241
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,110
and rambling a bit just bear with me
we'll figure this out

1242
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
we'll figure this out
 

1243
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,870
we'll figure this out
uh let's make this come down one more

1244
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
uh let's make this come down one more
 

1245
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,750
uh let's make this come down one more
like this i don't want the redstone to

1246
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
like this i don't want the redstone to
 

1247
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,430
like this i don't want the redstone to
go in front of the fences here though

1248
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440

 

1249
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,390

um so maybe we'll go out one more block

1250
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400

 

1251
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,390

this way let's actually

1252
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
this way let's actually
 

1253
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,750
this way let's actually
put our first monostable circuit here

1254
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760

 

1255
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,350

um okay

1256
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
um okay
 

1257
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,750
um okay
like that and then we need a repeater

1258
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
like that and then we need a repeater
 

1259
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,269
like that and then we need a repeater
going this way

1260
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279

 

1261
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,470

peter go to a block and then

1262
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
peter go to a block and then
 

1263
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,310
peter go to a block and then
down like so

1264
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320

 

1265
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,870

all right and then we'll run that uh

1266
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
all right and then we'll run that uh
 

1267
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,390
all right and then we'll run that uh
underneath

1268
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
underneath
 

1269
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,630
underneath
here i guess make that go down

1270
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640

 

1271
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,830

all the way to the front and then we'll

1272
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
all the way to the front and then we'll
 

1273
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,710
all the way to the front and then we'll
put a piston under this side

1274
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
put a piston under this side
 

1275
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,190
put a piston under this side
right here for the door

1276
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200

 

1277
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,830

so oh i wonder if i should move this

1278
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
so oh i wonder if i should move this
 

1279
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,830
so oh i wonder if i should move this
forward one because now we have two wood

1280
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
forward one because now we have two wood
 

1281
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,950
forward one because now we have two wood
blocks there ah it's fine

1282
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
blocks there ah it's fine
 

1283
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,149
blocks there ah it's fine
uh i'm losing it guys just bear with me

1284
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
uh i'm losing it guys just bear with me
 

1285
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,909
uh i'm losing it guys just bear with me
um all right

1286
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
um all right
 

1287
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,110
um all right
okay that will come to there that will

1288
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
okay that will come to there that will
 

1289
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,310
okay that will come to there that will
trigger the piston

1290
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320
trigger the piston
 

1291
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,350
trigger the piston
and this should all work now of course

1292
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
and this should all work now of course
 

1293
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,630
and this should all work now of course
i'm going to want to clean this up

1294
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
i'm going to want to clean this up
 

1295
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,909
i'm going to want to clean this up
but yay

1296
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
but yay
 

1297
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,950
but yay
and we'll need something

1298
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
and we'll need something
 

1299
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,789
and we'll need something
to hold the horse into so we'll need

1300
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
to hold the horse into so we'll need
 

1301
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,789
to hold the horse into so we'll need
that running across

1302
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799

 

1303
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,310

sweet and then we'll run them

1304
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
sweet and then we'll run them
 

1305
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,789
sweet and then we'll run them
all the way down

1306
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
all the way down
 

1307
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,669
all the way down
yeah so the plan with this is to dig

1308
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
yeah so the plan with this is to dig
 

1309
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,350
yeah so the plan with this is to dig
this out a little further i want to have

1310
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
this out a little further i want to have
 

1311
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,470
this out a little further i want to have
four of these on each side so four here

1312
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,480
four of these on each side so four here
 

1313
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,789
four of these on each side so four here
four

1314
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
four
 

1315
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,830
four
here total of eight and uh

1316
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
here total of eight and uh
 

1317
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,990
here total of eight and uh
that'll be a good level of storage for

1318
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
that'll be a good level of storage for
 

1319
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,909
that'll be a good level of storage for
the horses i think

1320
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
the horses i think
 

1321
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,070
the horses i think
and then at the very end of this i want

1322
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
and then at the very end of this i want
 

1323
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,990
and then at the very end of this i want
to have like a water drop

1324
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
to have like a water drop
 

1325
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,990
to have like a water drop
that i can ride a horse down from the

1326
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
that i can ride a horse down from the
 

1327
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,630
that i can ride a horse down from the
surface and just drop down into the cave

1328
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
surface and just drop down into the cave
 

1329
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,669
surface and just drop down into the cave
and also have an elevator

1330
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
and also have an elevator
 

1331
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,389
and also have an elevator
that i can be riding on a horse and ride

1332
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
that i can be riding on a horse and ride
 

1333
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,430
that i can be riding on a horse and ride
the elevator up

1334
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
the elevator up
 

1335
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,470
the elevator up
to the surface quickly and i got a

1336
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
to the surface quickly and i got a
 

1337
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,190
to the surface quickly and i got a
design for that all figured out already

1338
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
design for that all figured out already
 

1339
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,789
design for that all figured out already
that is compatible with

1340
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
that is compatible with
 

1341
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,070
that is compatible with
riding horses uh which should be pretty

1342
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
riding horses uh which should be pretty
 

1343
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,350
riding horses uh which should be pretty
cool now um

1344
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
cool now um
 

1345
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,430
cool now um
i guess that's gonna be it for this

1346
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
