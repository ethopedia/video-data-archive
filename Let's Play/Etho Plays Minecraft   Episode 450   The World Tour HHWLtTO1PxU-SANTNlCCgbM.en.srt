correct spots
 

679
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,150
correct spots
the the big slimes actually get uh moved

680
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
the the big slimes actually get uh moved
 

681
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,990
the the big slimes actually get uh moved
out of here automatically

682
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
out of here automatically
 

683
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,389
out of here automatically
and go around a track just for the

684
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
and go around a track just for the
 

685
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,990
and go around a track just for the
funsies of it

686
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
funsies of it
 

687
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,190
funsies of it
around our tree farm there if we go up

688
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
around our tree farm there if we go up
 

689
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,030
around our tree farm there if we go up
here

690
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
here
 

691
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,750
here
we can check it out i built this at the

692
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
we can check it out i built this at the
 

693
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,150
we can check it out i built this at the
time

694
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
time
 

695
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,550
time
when they they made the big change to

696
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
when they they made the big change to
 

697
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,750
when they they made the big change to
slimes they used to

698
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
slimes they used to
 

699
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,430
slimes they used to
always spawn below y16 and then they

700
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
always spawn below y16 and then they
 

701
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,790
always spawn below y16 and then they
made it so they could spawn at

702
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
made it so they could spawn at
 

703
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,750
made it so they could spawn at
level 40 and lower so i built this

704
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
level 40 and lower so i built this
 

705
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,030
level 40 and lower so i built this
spawning platfor

706
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
spawning platfor
 

707
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,790
spawning platfor
form for them right at level

708
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
form for them right at level
 

709
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,150
form for them right at level
it says y39 dude what is with the

710
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
it says y39 dude what is with the
 

711
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,509
it says y39 dude what is with the
creepers today

712
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
creepers today
 

713
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,030
creepers today
seriously i've seen like so many of them

714
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
seriously i've seen like so many of them
 

715
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
seriously i've seen like so many of them
but yeah they spawn on the on the

716
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
but yeah they spawn on the on the
 

717
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,310
but yeah they spawn on the on the
platform here they fall into the water

718
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
platform here they fall into the water
 

719
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,430
platform here they fall into the water
the water pushes them

720
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
the water pushes them
 

721
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,550
the water pushes them
up the elevator um and then they fall

722
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
up the elevator um and then they fall
 

723
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,629
up the elevator um and then they fall
down after they get separated and then

724
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
down after they get separated and then
 

725
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,150
down after they get separated and then
you kill them with a looting sword or

726
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
you kill them with a looting sword or
 

727
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,870
you kill them with a looting sword or
whatever

728
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
whatever
 

729
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,870
whatever
i've also added a automatic way of

730
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
i've also added a automatic way of
 

731
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,230
i've also added a automatic way of
killing them now

732
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
killing them now
 

733
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,750
killing them now
basically they go over the water and

734
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
basically they go over the water and
 

735
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,629
basically they go over the water and
since they can't swim anymore they sink

736
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
since they can't swim anymore they sink
 

737
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,710
since they can't swim anymore they sink
they fall down here and drown

738
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
they fall down here and drown
 

739
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,310
they fall down here and drown
slime balls fall into the hoppers and

740
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
slime balls fall into the hoppers and
 

741
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,350
slime balls fall into the hoppers and
there's probably if i was to guess

742
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
there's probably if i was to guess
 

743
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,030
there's probably if i was to guess
some sly balls in here i empty it every

744
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
some sly balls in here i empty it every
 

745
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,110
some sly balls in here i empty it every
now and then

746
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
now and then
 

747
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,870
now and then
and that is where all the slime comes

748
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
and that is where all the slime comes
 

749
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,310
and that is where all the slime comes
from in our world how's this one doing

750
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
from in our world how's this one doing
 

751
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,990
from in our world how's this one doing
there is a switch actually to switch

752
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
there is a switch actually to switch
 

753
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,670
there is a switch actually to switch
this so that they don't fall down here

754
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
this so that they don't fall down here
 

755
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,470
this so that they don't fall down here
but i don't remember

756
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
but i don't remember
 

757
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,750
but i don't remember
where the button is for the life of me

758
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
where the button is for the life of me
 

759
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,430
where the button is for the life of me
but if we break break over here there's

760
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
but if we break break over here there's
 

761
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,870
but if we break break over here there's
probably a bunch of redstone back here

762
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
probably a bunch of redstone back here
 

763
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,949
probably a bunch of redstone back here
yeah these are double extenders or i

764
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
yeah these are double extenders or i
 

765
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,550
yeah these are double extenders or i
think

766
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
think
 

767
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,509
think
where's the button guys i lost it i

768
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
where's the button guys i lost it i
 

769
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,430
where's the button guys i lost it i
don't know how to change it

770
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
don't know how to change it
 

771
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,110
don't know how to change it
or was it actually it might be through

772
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
or was it actually it might be through
 

773
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,110
or was it actually it might be through
here

774
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
here
 

775
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,189
here
oh let's break everything i should have

776
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
oh let's break everything i should have

779
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,870

is there a button here there's no button

780
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
is there a button here there's no button
 

781
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,470

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
there we go finally happens
 

785
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,189
there we go finally happens
all right so slime farm check

786
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
all right so slime farm check
 

787
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,230
all right so slime farm check
the slimes that fall down they uh they

788
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
the slimes that fall down they uh they
 

789
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,590
the slimes that fall down they uh they
fall down in a mine cart

790
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
fall down in a mine cart
 

791
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,069
fall down in a mine cart
off here we got a little viewing window

792
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
off here we got a little viewing window
 

793
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,269
off here we got a little viewing window
and it puts them underneath the

794
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
and it puts them underneath the
 

795
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,150
and it puts them underneath the
sandstone

they go around a loop around this uh

798
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
they go around a loop around this uh
 

799
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,509
they go around a loop around this uh
tree farm

800
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
tree farm
 

801
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,069
tree farm
this tree farm was also one of the first

802
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
this tree farm was also one of the first
 

803
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,230
this tree farm was also one of the first
things we built it was really important

this is a farm we never see really
 

839
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,990
this is a farm we never see really
and because of the hopper thing it

840
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
and because of the hopper thing it
 

841
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,670
and because of the hopper thing it
probably doesn't work but yeah

00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
right at the end here oh that's kind of
 

2059
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,270
right at the end here oh that's kind of
interesting it's a villager spawner

2060
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
interesting it's a villager spawner
 

2061
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,710
interesting it's a villager spawner
that's just like a graphical thing

2062
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
that's just like a graphical thing
 

2063
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,950
that's just like a graphical thing
though it doesn't actually spawn uh

2064
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
though it doesn't actually spawn uh
 

2065
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,750
though it doesn't actually spawn uh
exclusively villager zombies but they

2066
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
exclusively villager zombies but they
 

2067
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,030
exclusively villager zombies but they
spawn in these little spots here and

spawn in these little spots here and
 

2069
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,310
spawn in these little spots here and
then you can cure them

2070
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
then you can cure them
 

2071
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,349
then you can cure them
if they are villager zombies and then we

2072
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
if they are villager zombies and then we
 

2073
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,710
if they are villager zombies and then we
brought them down over here to our

2074
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
brought them down over here to our
 

2075
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,270
brought them down over here to our
village and if for some reason a zombie

2076
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
village and if for some reason a zombie
 

2077
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,790

of the gold farm here i'm gonna work on
 

2203
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,550
of the gold farm here i'm gonna work on
that hopefully

2204
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
that hopefully
 

2205

the portal here
 

2209
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,150
the portal here
and then we crush them and kill them get

2210
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
and then we crush them and kill them get
 

2211
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,510
and then we crush them and kill them get
their xp

2212
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
their xp
 

2213
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,589
their xp
uh we can light the portal with this and

2214
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
uh we can light the portal with this and
 

2215
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,990
uh we can light the portal with this and
this breaks its

2216
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
this breaks its
 

2217
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,390
this breaks its
um yeah we just saw all this stuff so

2218
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
um yeah we just saw all this stuff so
 

2219
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,550
um yeah we just saw all this stuff so
i'm not going to get too into it

2220

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,950
poppy poppy farm um
we built that just before we built the

2226
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
we built that just before we built the
 

2227
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,550
we built that just before we built the
nexus so that we would have lots and

2228
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
nexus so that we would have lots and
 

2229
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,630
nexus so that we would have lots and
lots of poppies and maybe some leftover

2230
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
lots of poppies and maybe some leftover
 

2231

iron for all the hoppers
it was going to require just over here

2234
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
it was going to require just over here
 

2235
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,870
it was going to require just over here
is the man cave

2236
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
is the man cave
 

2237
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,470
is the man cave
this is the other exit that we keep

2238
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
this is the other exit that we keep
 

2239
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,349
this is the other exit that we keep
seeing so you come out over here

2240
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
seeing so you come out over here
 

2241
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,349

to the left takes you to the swamp just
 

2243
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,349
to the left takes you to the swamp just
kind of experimented with a possible

2244
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:11,359
kind of experimented with a possible
 

2245
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,950
kind of experimented with a possible
look for it

2246
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
look for it
 

2247
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,349
look for it
with the mushrooms and the netherwart

2248
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
with the mushrooms and the netherwart
 

2249
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,870
with the mushrooms and the netherwart
and the crazy path

2250
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
and the crazy path
 

2251
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,349
and the crazy path
all that kind of stuff there's a system

2252
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:19,359
all that kind of stuff there's a system
 

2253
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,950
all that kind of stuff there's a system
here for collecting ender pearls

2254
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
here for collecting ender pearls
 

2255
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,550
here for collecting ender pearls
from the end that go through the end

2256
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
from the end that go through the end
 

2257
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,150
from the end that go through the end
portal

2258
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
portal
 

2259
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,270
portal
that's the true spawn right there

2260
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
that's the true spawn right there
 

2261
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,190
that's the true spawn right there
and then over here is the abandoned mine

2262
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
and then over here is the abandoned mine
 

2263
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,270
and then over here is the abandoned mine
shaft

2264
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
shaft
 

2265
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,190
shaft
this is where i did a lot of my branch

2266
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
this is where i did a lot of my branch
 

2267
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,390
this is where i did a lot of my branch
mining when we first started in the

2268
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
mining when we first started in the
 

2269
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,990
mining when we first started in the
world but i don't really come down here

2270
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
world but i don't really come down here
 

2271
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,670
world but i don't really come down here
anymore

2272
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
anymore
 

2273
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,270
anymore
i think there's like a snow golem that

2274
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
i think there's like a snow golem that
 

2275
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,710
i think there's like a snow golem that
walks around on these uh

2276
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720

 

2277
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,829

oh never mind he died i think

2278
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:46,839
oh never mind he died i think
 

2279
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,309
oh never mind he died i think
maybe used to be a snow golem up here

2280
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
maybe used to be a snow golem up here
 

2281
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,430
maybe used to be a snow golem up here
i still see the snow he would make the

2282
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
i still see the snow he would make the
 

2283
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,109
i still see the snow he would make the
lights blink though oh he is still there

2284
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
lights blink though oh he is still there
 

2285
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,390
lights blink though oh he is still there
look at that

2286
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
look at that
 

2287
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,910
look at that
yeah you'd walk on pressure plates make

2288
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
yeah you'd walk on pressure plates make
 

2289
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,510
yeah you'd walk on pressure plates make
the lights blink

2290
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
the lights blink
 

2291
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,390
the lights blink
um there was a system here for breaking

2292
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
um there was a system here for breaking
 

2293
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,790
um there was a system here for breaking
down boats to get oak wood out of them

2294
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
down boats to get oak wood out of them
 

2295
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,630
down boats to get oak wood out of them
in case you wanted to convert jungle

2296
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
in case you wanted to convert jungle
 

2297
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,550
in case you wanted to convert jungle
wood into oakwood for example

2298
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
wood into oakwood for example
 

2299
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,109
wood into oakwood for example
and then that's broken very good very

2300
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
and then that's broken very good very
 

2301
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,150
and then that's broken very good very
good

2302
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
good
 

2303
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,390
good
yeah lots and lots of branches here

2304
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
yeah lots and lots of branches here
 

2305
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,069
yeah lots and lots of branches here
though and again this was a way

2306
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
though and again this was a way
 

2307
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,829
though and again this was a way
i paid tribute to the people that

2308
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
i paid tribute to the people that
 

2309

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
donated to me in the past
 

2311
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,630
donated to me in the past
because i kind of ran out of space in

2312
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
because i kind of ran out of space in
 

2313
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,710
because i kind of ran out of space in
the tree farm

2314
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
the tree farm
 

2315
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,230
the tree farm

this is a cool trick you know you can

2318
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
this is a cool trick you know you can
 

2319
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,589
this is a cool trick you know you can
still use this i think

2320
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:31,599
still use this i think
 

2321
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,870
still use this i think

here all of these are totally automatic
 

2699
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,910
here all of these are totally automatic
like that and now they actually replant

2700
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:53,920
like that and now they actually replant
 

2701

t-flip-flop uh
 

2723
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,430
t-flip-flop uh
method and more recently we built a

2724
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:17,440
method and more recently we built a
 

2725
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,270
method and more recently we built a
course fruit farm here

2726
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,280
course fruit farm here
 

2727
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,870
course fruit farm here
i built this thinking i would use it

2728
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:20,880
i built this thinking i would use it
 

2729
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,549
i built this thinking i would use it
maybe two or three times total and then

2730
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
maybe two or three times total and then
 

2731
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,390
maybe two or three times total and then
we would have so much per per blocks i

2732
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
we would have so much per per blocks i
 

2733
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,069
we would have so much per per blocks i
would never know what to do with them

2734
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
would never know what to do with them
 

2735
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,270
would never know what to do with them
but i use this thing constantly like

2736
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
but i use this thing constantly like
 

2737
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,349
but i use this thing constantly like
i've used it probably 20 times already

2738
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:31,359
i've used it probably 20 times already
 

2739
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,510
i've used it probably 20 times already
and i still need more

2740
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
and i still need more
 

2741
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,190
and i still need more
and they take too long to grow i wish i

2742
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
and they take too long to grow i wish i
 

2743
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,190
and they take too long to grow i wish i
made it bigger

2744
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
made it bigger
 

2745
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,109
made it bigger
but yeah you press a button after you

2746
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119
but yeah you press a button after you
 

2747
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,109
but yeah you press a button after you
break all the seeds off

2748
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
break all the seeds off
 

2749
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,150
break all the seeds off
automatically harvests them this is all

2750
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
automatically harvests them this is all
 

2751
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,109
automatically harvests them this is all
on a timer so they all perfectly flow

2752
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
on a timer so they all perfectly flow
 

2753
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,990
on a timer so they all perfectly flow
again this is a backup world though so

2754
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
again this is a backup world though so
 

2755
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,069
again this is a backup world though so
we didn't get any seeds there

2756
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
we didn't get any seeds there
 

2757
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,510
we didn't get any seeds there
not a big deal they all get sorted and

2758
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,520
not a big deal they all get sorted and
 

2759
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,030
not a big deal they all get sorted and
then brought over to that blacksmith

2760
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
then brought over to that blacksmith
 

2761
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,710
then brought over to that blacksmith
area we just checked out

2762
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
area we just checked out
 

2763
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,230
area we just checked out
you got a little access to the wiring

2764
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
you got a little access to the wiring
 

2765
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,430
you got a little access to the wiring
and all that kind of stuff down here

2766
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,440
and all that kind of stuff down here
 

2767
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,510
and all that kind of stuff down here
okay moving on past the village there we

2768
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
okay moving on past the village there we
 

2769
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,630
okay moving on past the village there we
have the guardian farm which we recently

2770
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
have the guardian farm which we recently
 

2771
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,510
have the guardian farm which we recently
tried to improve a little bit they spawn

2772
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
tried to improve a little bit they spawn
 

2773
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,549
tried to improve a little bit they spawn
there this is an

2774
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:12,559
there this is an
 

2775
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,910
there this is an
old old world guys if you generate using

2776
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
old old world guys if you generate using
 

2777
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,470
old old world guys if you generate using
the seed i'm using currently

2778
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
the seed i'm using currently
 

2779
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,309
the seed i'm using currently
since the terrain has changed since i

2780
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,319
since the terrain has changed since i
 

2781
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,150
since the terrain has changed since i
made this world this area here is

2782
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
made this world this area here is
 

2783
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,630
made this world this area here is
actually

2784
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,640
actually
 

2785
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,589
actually
ocean it if you generate with the

2786
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:25,599
ocean it if you generate with the
 

2787
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,109
ocean it if you generate with the
current with the seed i used for this

2788
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
current with the seed i used for this
 

2789
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,150
current with the seed i used for this
world

2790
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
world
 

2791
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,910
world
so it thinks a guardian temple is

2792
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
so it thinks a guardian temple is
 

2793
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,829
so it thinks a guardian temple is
supposed to spawn there so i hollowed

2794
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:31,839
supposed to spawn there so i hollowed
 

2795
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,670
supposed to spawn there so i hollowed
out all the grounds

2796
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
out all the grounds
 

2797
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,390
out all the grounds
filled it with water and that's how i'm

2798
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,400
filled it with water and that's how i'm
 

2799
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,470
filled it with water and that's how i'm
able to get guardians there

2800
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,480
able to get guardians there
 

2801
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,750
able to get guardians there
uh we recently just did this

00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
uh we recently just did this
 

2803
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,190
uh we recently just did this
fancy little killing chamber for the

2804
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
fancy little killing chamber for the
 

2805

hoppers collect their drops the drops
 

2811
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,470
hoppers collect their drops the drops
get sorted into these

2812
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:52,480
get sorted into these
 

2813
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,990
get sorted into these
chests and

2814
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
chests and
 

2815
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,589
chests and
we just saw that stuff so let's get out

2816
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
we just saw that stuff so let's get out
 

2817
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,190
we just saw that stuff so let's get out
of here oh yeah there's a

2818
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
of here oh yeah there's a
 

2819
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,710
of here oh yeah there's a
an elevator here i'll just i'll show you

2820
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
an elevator here i'll just i'll show you
 

2821

2823
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,109

kind of my new go-to design for

2824
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:05,119

the ocelots just didn't quite do the job

2990
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
the ocelots just didn't quite do the job
 

2991
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,309
the ocelots just didn't quite do the job
too well

2992
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
too well
 

2993
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,150
too well
um so i had a hard time making this work

2994
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
um so i had a hard time making this work
 

2995
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,670
um so i had a hard time making this work
i was trying to make like an automatic

2996
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
i was trying to make like an automatic
 

2997
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,270
i was trying to make like an automatic
tree farm with it

2998
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
tree farm with it
 

2999
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,030
tree farm with it
and now though in the game it's easy to

3000
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
and now though in the game it's easy to
 

3001
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,630
and now though in the game it's easy to
separate creepers so maybe

3002
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
separate creepers so maybe
 

3003
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,030
separate creepers so maybe
one day we'll look back into that whole

3004
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
one day we'll look back into that whole
 

3005
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,630
one day we'll look back into that whole
concept

3006
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
concept
 

3007
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,230
concept
this is going to be our storage room

3008
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
this is going to be our storage room
 

3009
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,390
this is going to be our storage room
this is like back before i think trapped

3010
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
this is like back before i think trapped
 

3011
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,069
this is like back before i think trapped
chests or before you could put them side

3012
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
chests or before you could put them side
 

3013
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,750
chests or before you could put them side
by side so this is the

3014
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
by side so this is the
 

3015
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,789
by side so this is the
arrangement i found that worked best and

3016
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:24,799
arrangement i found that worked best and
 

3017
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,549
arrangement i found that worked best and
we have that on all four sides

3018
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
we have that on all four sides
 

3019
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,950
we have that on all four sides
never did end up filling them though i

3020
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:28,960
never did end up filling them though i
 

3021
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,390
never did end up filling them though i
don't think

3022
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
don't think
 

3023
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,870
don't think
down below here is where we have

3024
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
down below here is where we have
 

3025
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,630
down below here is where we have
some other some other kind of crazy

3026
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
some other some other kind of crazy
 

3027
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,150
some other some other kind of crazy
stuff

3028
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,160
stuff
 

3029
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,990
stuff
uh also that tunnel in the man cave

3030
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
uh also that tunnel in the man cave
 

3031
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,670
uh also that tunnel in the man cave
leads to the stronghold that one we

3032
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
leads to the stronghold that one we
 

3033
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,789
leads to the stronghold that one we
didn't go down

3034
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
didn't go down
 

3035
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,990
didn't go down
by the ender porter this is the

3036
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
by the ender porter this is the
 

3037
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,230
by the ender porter this is the
silverfish farm i

3038
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
silverfish farm i
 

3039
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,549
silverfish farm i
calculated it so exactly enough

3040
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
calculated it so exactly enough
 

3041
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:51,589
calculated it so exactly enough
silverfish would

3042
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
silverfish would
 

3043
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,670
silverfish would
would fill this room there in these

3044
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
would fill this room there in these
 

3045
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,710
would fill this room there in these
blocks right here

3046
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720

 

3047
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,470

each one of these so that when you kill

3048
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
each one of these so that when you kill
 

3049
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,309
each one of these so that when you kill
them all you would get 50 levels back

3050
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:02,319
them all you would get 50 levels back
 

3051
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,230
them all you would get 50 levels back
when you needed 50 levels to enchant

3052
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
when you needed 50 levels to enchant
 

3053
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,109
when you needed 50 levels to enchant
something

3054
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119

 

3055
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,270

it was an idea i thought was good at the

3056
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,280
it was an idea i thought was good at the
 

3057
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,630
it was an idea i thought was good at the
time

3058
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
time
 

3059
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,309
time
but um kind of just became a novelty

3060
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
but um kind of just became a novelty
 

3061
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,190
but um kind of just became a novelty
project

3062
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
project
 

3063
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,549
project
i really wish they would make it in the

3064
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
i really wish they would make it in the
 

3065
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,390
i really wish they would make it in the
game so you could use silk touch on the

3066
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
game so you could use silk touch on the
 

3067
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,910
game so you could use silk touch on the
silverfish blocks then that would

3068
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
silverfish blocks then that would
 

3069
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,190
silverfish blocks then that would
actually have a purpose again

3070
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
actually have a purpose again
 

3071
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,950
actually have a purpose again
and like on servers people would build

3072
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
and like on servers people would build
 

3073
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,230
and like on servers people would build
silverfish farms

3074
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
silverfish farms
 

3075
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,230
silverfish farms
just to troll people i think if you

3076
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
just to troll people i think if you
 

3077
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,829
just to troll people i think if you
could move the blocks around easy

3078
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:28,839
could move the blocks around easy
 

3079
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,549
could move the blocks around easy
um yeah we got the whole silverfish farm

3080
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
um yeah we got the whole silverfish farm
 

3081
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,430
um yeah we got the whole silverfish farm
over here

3082
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,440
over here
 

3083
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,150
over here
the spawners inside there um they fall

3084
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
the spawners inside there um they fall
 

3085
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,670
the spawners inside there um they fall
down into the water stream above the

3086
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
down into the water stream above the
 

3087
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,349
down into the water stream above the
stone block there

3088
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
stone block there
 

3089
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,190
stone block there
which gets replaced by a stone generator

3090
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
which gets replaced by a stone generator
 

3091
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,589
which gets replaced by a stone generator
when they enter the block a buds but

3092
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
when they enter the block a buds but
 

3093
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,270
when they enter the block a buds but
detector

3094
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
detector
 

3095
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,230
detector
detects it and makes a new stone block

3096
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
detects it and makes a new stone block
 

3097
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,549
detects it and makes a new stone block
take its place and this gets pushed down

3098
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
take its place and this gets pushed down
 

3099
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,230
take its place and this gets pushed down
they all get stacked together into the

3100
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
they all get stacked together into the
 

3101
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,750
they all get stacked together into the
big clump over here

3102
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
big clump over here
 

3103
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,670
big clump over here
and you can use a poison potion on these

3104
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680
and you can use a poison potion on these
 

3105
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,950

to
 

3107
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,710
to
really get a bunch of them spawning at

3108
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
really get a bunch of them spawning at
 

3109
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:07,190
really get a bunch of them spawning at
once

3110
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200

 

3111

uh inside this silverfish farm is also

3148
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
uh inside this silverfish farm is also
 

3149
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,710
uh inside this silverfish farm is also
our ender portal so let's go through

3150
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,720
our ender portal so let's go through
 

3151
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,030
our ender portal so let's go through
that

3152
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
that
 

3153
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,910
that

ender pearls would get ejected into here

this is a musical randomizer

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,720
this is a musical randomizer
which sounds pretty cool

guys but they're all spawning in places

3213
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,710

uh the idea of the farm was there's like

00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
uh the idea of the farm was there's like
 

3215
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,150
uh the idea of the farm was there's like
a bunch of pressure plates up there and

3216
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
a bunch of pressure plates up there and
 

3217
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,910
a bunch of pressure plates up there and
that when they would spawn on them

3218
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:21,920
that when they would spawn on them
 

3219
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,430
that when they would spawn on them
pistons would push them down they would

pistons would push them down they would
 

3221
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,069

3239
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,549

to spawn a new portal every time
 

3671
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,950
to spawn a new portal every time
and you get more and more obsidian now

3672
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:56,960
and you get more and more obsidian now
 

3673
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,069
and you get more and more obsidian now
you can actually

you can actually
 

3675
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,710
you can actually
farm obsidian in the end since uh every

3676
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
farm obsidian in the end since uh every
 

3677
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,630

operation we got
 

3685
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,109
operation we got
and further down here actually not too

at the back portal there all right it's
 

3693
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,189
at the back portal there all right it's
back at the nether hub and if we go down

3694
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:19,199
back at the nether hub and if we go down
 

3695
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,149
back at the nether hub and if we go down
this direction
