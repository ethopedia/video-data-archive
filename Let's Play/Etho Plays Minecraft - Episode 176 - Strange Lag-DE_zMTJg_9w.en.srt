removing the redstone to see if that was
a cause but you just heard one of the

142
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,450
shutoff switch and now I really think it
 

143
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,229
shutoff switch and now I really think it
should I should get to finishing that

should I should get to finishing that
 

145
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,970
should I should get to finishing that
because it's not good if this room fills

don't drink coffee before I record but
sometimes I do and it's a mistake it

162
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,530
sometimes I do and it's a mistake it
 

163
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,920
sometimes I do and it's a mistake it
also seems to be a lot of slimes around

164
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:31,930
also seems to be a lot of slimes around
 

165
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:40,320
also seems to be a lot of slimes around
here lots of slime chunks maybe we'll go

166
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,330
here lots of slime chunks maybe we'll go
 

167
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,260
here lots of slime chunks maybe we'll go
hunt them real quick probably they're

168
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,270
hunt them real quick probably they're
 

169
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,240
hunt them real quick probably they're
there I definitely got to seal this up

170
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,250
there I definitely got to seal this up
 

171
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,000
there I definitely got to seal this up
I've had creepers come down if you give

172
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,010
I've had creepers come down if you give
 

173
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,590
I've had creepers come down if you give
an opportunity for a creeper to come

174
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
an opportunity for a creeper to come
 

175
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,930
an opportunity for a creeper to come
down they do you got to have at least

176
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:57,940
down they do you got to have at least
 

177
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,420
down they do you got to have at least
the three block like over you need a

178
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,430
the three block like over you need a
 

179
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,760
the three block like over you need a
four block drop look at all this you got

180
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:05,770
four block drop look at all this you got
 

181
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,409
four block drop look at all this you got
a four block drop mobs usually won't

182
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:07,419
a four block drop mobs usually won't
 

183
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,770
a four block drop mobs usually won't
fall down it but if it's three or less

184
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:10,780
fall down it but if it's three or less
 

185
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,250
fall down it but if it's three or less
they will always make their way to it

186
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,260

 

187
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,960

yea-ah thinking of a future slime farm

188
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:23,970

 

189
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,860

definitely a possibility

190
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,870
definitely a possibility
 

191
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,290
definitely a possibility
I actually that's one of the things I

192
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,300
I actually that's one of the things I
 

193
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,090
I actually that's one of the things I
might do today is finish up the old one

194
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,100
might do today is finish up the old one
 

195
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,590
might do today is finish up the old one
because I don't think I'm going to do

196
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
because I don't think I'm going to do
 

197
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,620
because I don't think I'm going to do
anything super fancy with it like I

198
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,630
anything super fancy with it like I
 

199
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,969
anything super fancy with it like I
originally planned I would rather just

200
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:35,979
originally planned I would rather just
 

201
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,330
originally planned I would rather just
make another one here

202
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:39,340
make another one here
 

203
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,530
make another one here
just finish that one up so much slide

204
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:46,540
just finish that one up so much slide
 

205
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,240
just finish that one up so much slide
that's crazy oh you know why because I

206
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,250
that's crazy oh you know why because I
 

207
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,480
that's crazy oh you know why because I
got the mob system running aha so

208
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,490
got the mob system running aha so
 

209
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,409
got the mob system running aha so
they're giving more ch

210
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:55,419
they're giving more ch
 

211
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,830
they're giving more ch
they're given more chances to spawn here

212
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840

 

213
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,930

there's more all right we'll leave them

214
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:03,940
there's more all right we'll leave them
 

215
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,650
there's more all right we'll leave them
be anyway the mob system is up and

216
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:07,660
be anyway the mob system is up and
 

217
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,350
be anyway the mob system is up and
running I'm gonna disable that right now

218
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
running I'm gonna disable that right now
 

219
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,440
running I'm gonna disable that right now
and I'll be back because it's still

220
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,450
and I'll be back because it's still
 

221
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,900
and I'll be back because it's still
liking the game until I deal with it I'm

222
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:18,910
liking the game until I deal with it I'm
 

223
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,460
liking the game until I deal with it I'm
so glad I found that though because that

224
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,470
so glad I found that though because that
 

225
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,120
so glad I found that though because that
was really confusing me

226
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,130

 

227
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,430

alright so that detector there was

228
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
alright so that detector there was
 

229
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,830
alright so that detector there was
definitely the source of all my problems

230
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
definitely the source of all my problems
 

231
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,760
definitely the source of all my problems
I got rid of a repeater that was over

232
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:35,770
I got rid of a repeater that was over
 

233
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,340
I got rid of a repeater that was over
here broke the clock cycle and

234
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,350
here broke the clock cycle and
 

235
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,379
here broke the clock cycle and
everything is running super smooth again

236
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:40,389
everything is running super smooth again
 

237
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,909
everything is running super smooth again
which is just great I'm glad it wasn't

238
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:44,919
which is just great I'm glad it wasn't
 

239
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,830
which is just great I'm glad it wasn't
anything related to the mob system yeah

240
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
anything related to the mob system yeah
 

241
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,500
anything related to the mob system yeah
I inadvertently made a clock out of this

242
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,510
I inadvertently made a clock out of this
 

243
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,090
I inadvertently made a clock out of this
thing all I have to do is get rid of the

244
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,100
thing all I have to do is get rid of the
 

245
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,190
thing all I have to do is get rid of the
torch there and use a lever or something

246
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,200
torch there and use a lever or something
 

247
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,210
torch there and use a lever or something
else and it will work just fine and I

248
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,220
else and it will work just fine and I
 

249
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,710
else and it will work just fine and I
that's not hooked up though at the

250
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:01,720
that's not hooked up though at the
 

251
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,760
that's not hooked up though at the
moment just for the future what I wanted

252
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:05,770
moment just for the future what I wanted
 

253
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,510
moment just for the future what I wanted
to do oh yeah and people suggested I

254
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
to do oh yeah and people suggested I
 

255
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,550
to do oh yeah and people suggested I
should put colored wool behind these

256
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:11,560
should put colored wool behind these
 

257
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,100
should put colored wool behind these
tile things that might be pretty cool

258
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,110
tile things that might be pretty cool
 

259
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,320
tile things that might be pretty cool
I don't know what color I would choose

260
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,330
I don't know what color I would choose
 

261
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,620
I don't know what color I would choose
if I did that or colors water was also

262
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,630
if I did that or colors water was also
 

263
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,390
if I did that or colors water was also
suggested can't use lava or well

264
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
suggested can't use lava or well
 

265
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,159
suggested can't use lava or well
actually maybe I could I don't know if I

266
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:29,169
actually maybe I could I don't know if I
 

267
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,279
actually maybe I could I don't know if I
would want to though

268
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,289
would want to though
 

269
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,550
would want to though
yeah I think you could actually do lava

270
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
yeah I think you could actually do lava
 

271
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,170
yeah I think you could actually do lava
or leaves is another thing I was

272
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,180
or leaves is another thing I was
 

273
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,620
or leaves is another thing I was
thinking of doing but actually I wonder

274
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,630
thinking of doing but actually I wonder
 

275
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,540
thinking of doing but actually I wonder
if you were to put wall behind it if it

276
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,550
if you were to put wall behind it if it
 

277
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,529
if you were to put wall behind it if it
would be bright enough I guess yeah it

278
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:46,539
would be bright enough I guess yeah it
 

279
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,000
would be bright enough I guess yeah it
probably would the smooth stone looks

280
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,010
probably would the smooth stone looks
 

281
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,219
probably would the smooth stone looks
pretty bright back there it'd probably

282
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:50,229
pretty bright back there it'd probably
 

283
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,159
pretty bright back there it'd probably
be good I want to show the rate

284
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,169
be good I want to show the rate
 

285
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,800
be good I want to show the rate
as the mob system at the moment so we

286
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:55,810
as the mob system at the moment so we
 

287
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,899
as the mob system at the moment so we
got seven out of 12 layers done so just

288
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:00,909
got seven out of 12 layers done so just
 

289
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:09,239
got seven out of 12 layers done so just
a little bit more than 50% here we go I

290
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,249
a little bit more than 50% here we go I
 

291
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:12,320
a little bit more than 50% here we go I
just put some last year temporarily and

292
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,330
just put some last year temporarily and
 

293
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,689
just put some last year temporarily and
you can see we're not getting many mobs

294
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:15,699
you can see we're not getting many mobs
 

295
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,860
you can see we're not getting many mobs
at the moment it's probably nighttime

296
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:19,870
at the moment it's probably nighttime
 

297
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,800
at the moment it's probably nighttime
for one thing not larry'll but yeah

298
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:22,810
for one thing not larry'll but yeah
 

299
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,579
for one thing not larry'll but yeah
rates are really slow because I have a

300
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:26,589
rates are really slow because I have a
 

301
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,439
rates are really slow because I have a
lot of caves I need to light up in the

302
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:28,449
lot of caves I need to light up in the
 

303
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,300
lot of caves I need to light up in the
area yet before this thing is going to

304
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,310
area yet before this thing is going to
 

305
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,829
area yet before this thing is going to
get super quick so that will take that

306
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:34,839
get super quick so that will take that
 

307
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,449
get super quick so that will take that
will take time and I also have to finish

308
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:36,459
will take time and I also have to finish
 

309
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,370
will take time and I also have to finish
the other five layers or whatever and

310
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:38,380
the other five layers or whatever and
 

311
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,889
the other five layers or whatever and
that will improve things quite a bit as

312
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:40,899
that will improve things quite a bit as
 

313
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,230
that will improve things quite a bit as
well so all is good but it's going to be

314
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
well so all is good but it's going to be
 

315
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:55,189
well so all is good but it's going to be
slow until I do do those things um see

316
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:55,199
slow until I do do those things um see
 

317
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,949
slow until I do do those things um see
yeah I think we're going to go back to

318
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
yeah I think we're going to go back to
 

319
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,199
yeah I think we're going to go back to
the other base and work on the slime

320
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:01,209
the other base and work on the slime
 

321
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,590
the other base and work on the slime
stuff maybe I think that's a good plan

322
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
stuff maybe I think that's a good plan
 

323
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,810
stuff maybe I think that's a good plan
I'm tempted to break all these

324
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:06,820
I'm tempted to break all these
 

325
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,449
I'm tempted to break all these
silverfish things but it should probably

326
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:09,459
silverfish things but it should probably
 

327
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,090
silverfish things but it should probably
set up a killing chamber before I do

328
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,100
set up a killing chamber before I do
 

329
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,730
set up a killing chamber before I do
that because this room is totally full

330
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:14,740
that because this room is totally full
 

331
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,660
that because this room is totally full
now I got the lights on there so no more

332
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:18,670
now I got the lights on there so no more
 

333
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,930
now I got the lights on there so no more
spawning alright yeah let's go to the

334
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:24,940
spawning alright yeah let's go to the
 

335
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,620
spawning alright yeah let's go to the
other base okay here we are yeah we're

336
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:31,630
other base okay here we are yeah we're
 

337
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,650
other base okay here we are yeah we're
going to work on this a little bit when

338
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:34,660
going to work on this a little bit when
 

339
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,449
going to work on this a little bit when
I first made this glass thing it was

340
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:36,459
I first made this glass thing it was
 

341
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,040
I first made this glass thing it was
only supposed to be temporary but we've

342
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,050
only supposed to be temporary but we've
 

343
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,480
only supposed to be temporary but we've
kept it for many many months and it's

344
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,490
kept it for many many months and it's
 

345
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,030
kept it for many many months and it's
bug it's been bugging me ever since and

346
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
bug it's been bugging me ever since and
 

347
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,550
bug it's been bugging me ever since and
I'm sure it's been bugging you guys so I

348
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm sure it's been bugging you guys so I
 

349
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,189
I'm sure it's been bugging you guys so I
want to get rid of the glass we we need

350
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:50,199
want to get rid of the glass we we need
 

351
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,230
want to get rid of the glass we we need
to sort of use a transparent block so we

352
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
to sort of use a transparent block so we
 

353
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,009
to sort of use a transparent block so we
can see the slimes I just don't like the

354
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:56,019
can see the slimes I just don't like the
 

355
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,350
can see the slimes I just don't like the
glass because the white really stands

356
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,360
glass because the white really stands
 

357
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,250
glass because the white really stands
out with it so we have to use another

358
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,260
out with it so we have to use another
 

359
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,700
out with it so we have to use another
transparent block

360
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:06,710
transparent block
 

361
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,760
transparent block
so iron bars are an option I was

362
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:09,770
so iron bars are an option I was
 

363
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,650
so iron bars are an option I was
thinking nether brick fences would be

364
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:11,660
thinking nether brick fences would be
 

365
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:18,670
thinking nether brick fences would be
cool and just tab open air spaces but

366
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:18,680
cool and just tab open air spaces but
 

367
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,390
cool and just tab open air spaces but
we'll play around with this a little bit

368
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:21,400
we'll play around with this a little bit
 

369
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,640
we'll play around with this a little bit
get her glass back and I also want to

370
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:24,650
get her glass back and I also want to
 

371
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,610
get her glass back and I also want to
try a cup the rail a little bit today

372
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:27,620
try a cup the rail a little bit today
 

373
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,230
try a cup the rail a little bit today
maybe because that was as a really cool

374
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
maybe because that was as a really cool
 

375
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,850
maybe because that was as a really cool
idea I think like a fun idea

376
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:33,860
idea I think like a fun idea
 

377
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,390
idea I think like a fun idea
but I've never hooked it up yet

378
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,400

 

379
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:48,270

procrastinating no you know the word see

380
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,280
procrastinating no you know the word see
 

381
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,810
procrastinating no you know the word see
so the big slimes are two point four

382
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:52,820
so the big slimes are two point four
 

383
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,260
so the big slimes are two point four
blocks I think all three directions how

384
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,270
blocks I think all three directions how
 

385
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:08,680
blocks I think all three directions how
is this going to work if we do that and

386
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,690
is this going to work if we do that and
 

387
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,380
is this going to work if we do that and
I guess we could have a one block gap

388
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,390
I guess we could have a one block gap
 

389
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,920
I guess we could have a one block gap
between like I don't think they'd be

390
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:14,930
between like I don't think they'd be
 

391
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,520
between like I don't think they'd be
able to fit through that for sure I have

392
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,530
able to fit through that for sure I have
 

393
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,700
able to fit through that for sure I have
another one here perhaps and here and

394
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:21,710
another one here perhaps and here and
 

395
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,530
another one here perhaps and here and
I'm just going to leave it as a manual

396
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm just going to leave it as a manual
 

397
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm just going to leave it as a manual
killing thing originally I planned on

398
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,250
killing thing originally I planned on
 

399
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,430
killing thing originally I planned on
having ways of of splitting the bigger

400
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:30,440
having ways of of splitting the bigger
 

401
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,260
having ways of of splitting the bigger
slimes and having the smaller ones go

402
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,270
slimes and having the smaller ones go
 

403
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,030
slimes and having the smaller ones go
into the next chamber and then splitting

404
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,040
into the next chamber and then splitting
 

405
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,560
into the next chamber and then splitting
them again and going into the next

406
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,570
them again and going into the next
 

407
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,540
them again and going into the next
chamber type thing but that's just not

408
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:40,550
chamber type thing but that's just not
 

409
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,760
chamber type thing but that's just not
really doesn't have much point to it

410
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:42,770
really doesn't have much point to it
 

411
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,410
really doesn't have much point to it
really all right let's see if this guide

412
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:47,420
really all right let's see if this guide
 

413
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,170
really all right let's see if this guide
you can get through here

414
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,180

 

415
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,500

all right so he's trapped I don't know

416
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:55,510
all right so he's trapped I don't know
 

417
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:05,230
all right so he's trapped I don't know
if I like the look of that hmm all right

418
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
if I like the look of that hmm all right
 

419
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,600
if I like the look of that hmm all right
what else can we do so I'm just going to

420
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,610
what else can we do so I'm just going to
 

421
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,370
what else can we do so I'm just going to
keep it like a manual killing thing so

422
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,380
keep it like a manual killing thing so
 

423
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,440
keep it like a manual killing thing so
we can walk in and kill him like that

424
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,450
we can walk in and kill him like that
 

425
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,460
we can walk in and kill him like that
can they fit through yeah I figured they

426
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,470
can they fit through yeah I figured they
 

427
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,900
can they fit through yeah I figured they
would mmm they even fit through there so

428
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:21,910
would mmm they even fit through there so
 

429
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,850
would mmm they even fit through there so
the medium ones are one point two blocks

430
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:24,860
the medium ones are one point two blocks
 

431
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,720
the medium ones are one point two blocks
in all three directions I believe the

432
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:28,730
in all three directions I believe the
 

433
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:35,320
in all three directions I believe the
little ones are 0.6 blocks so I don't

434
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,330
little ones are 0.6 blocks so I don't
 

435
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,730
little ones are 0.6 blocks so I don't
know how we would even do the little

436
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:36,740
know how we would even do the little
 

437
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,930
know how we would even do the little
ones I think we have to use half slabs

438
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:39,940
ones I think we have to use half slabs
 

439
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,010
ones I think we have to use half slabs
somehow because I'm pretty sure if we

440
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,020
somehow because I'm pretty sure if we
 

441
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,630
somehow because I'm pretty sure if we
did that they could fit through there

442
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:43,640
did that they could fit through there
 

443
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:54,180
did that they could fit through there
yeah cuz we can mmm

444
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,190

 

445
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,840

mmm all right well maybe we will work on

446
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:58,850
mmm all right well maybe we will work on
 

447
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,450
mmm all right well maybe we will work on
the rail line first I'll think about

448
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:01,460
the rail line first I'll think about
 

449
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,170
the rail line first I'll think about
this a little bit so if I can we put

450
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,180
this a little bit so if I can we put
 

451
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,910
this a little bit so if I can we put
this on glowstone you know we still

452
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:06,920
this on glowstone you know we still
 

453
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
this on glowstone you know we still
can't I should probably get rid of the

454
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:08,930
can't I should probably get rid of the
 

455
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,200
can't I should probably get rid of the
glowstone floor and put the minecart

456
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,210
glowstone floor and put the minecart
 

457
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:28,500
glowstone floor and put the minecart
track here right there OOP secret wiring

458
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,510
track here right there OOP secret wiring
 

459
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,660
track here right there OOP secret wiring
yeah I hate I hate messing up the floor

460
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:31,670
yeah I hate I hate messing up the floor
 

461
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,810
yeah I hate I hate messing up the floor
around here because there's a lot of

462
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:34,820
around here because there's a lot of
 

463
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,100
around here because there's a lot of
stuff underneath the ground okay we'll

464
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,110
stuff underneath the ground okay we'll
 

465
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,170
stuff underneath the ground okay we'll
just put this here from now we'll put

466
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,180
just put this here from now we'll put
 

467
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:54,480
just put this here from now we'll put
one yeah we'll just do one who found me

468
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,490
one yeah we'll just do one who found me
 

469
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:02,500
one yeah we'll just do one who found me
how did you find me whoop go like that

470
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,510
how did you find me whoop go like that
 

471
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,780
how did you find me whoop go like that
and then go this way and if we do this

472
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:07,790
and then go this way and if we do this
 

473
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,350
and then go this way and if we do this
let's see so hopefully they'll go in

474
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360
let's see so hopefully they'll go in
 

475
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,170
let's see so hopefully they'll go in
that and then if we have a pressure

476
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,180
that and then if we have a pressure
 

477
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,620
that and then if we have a pressure
plate here over here I think when they

478
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:23,630
plate here over here I think when they
 

479
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,360
plate here over here I think when they
get in the cards they'll automatically

480
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,370
get in the cards they'll automatically
 

481
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,460
get in the cards they'll automatically
hit the pressure plates and then take

482
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,470
hit the pressure plates and then take
 

483
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,750
hit the pressure plates and then take
off so I think that might be an

484
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:28,760
off so I think that might be an
 

485
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,730
off so I think that might be an
automatic launcher for the big slimes I

486
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:32,740
automatic launcher for the big slimes I
 

487
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,390
automatic launcher for the big slimes I
hope

488
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,400

 

489
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,560

okay so I was messing around with this a

490
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,570
okay so I was messing around with this a
 

491
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,480
okay so I was messing around with this a
little bit and I found something for the

492
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,490
little bit and I found something for the
 

493
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,940
little bit and I found something for the
little guys here they can't fit through

494
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:45,950
little guys here they can't fit through
 

495
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,950
little guys here they can't fit through
that space so if we have a iron bar

496
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:47,960
that space so if we have a iron bar
 

497
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,470
that space so if we have a iron bar
that's not connected to the wall over

498
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
that's not connected to the wall over
 

499
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,150
that's not connected to the wall over
there and then we have a block over here

500
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
there and then we have a block over here
 

501
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
there and then we have a block over here
we can hold them back or hold them

502
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:56,810
we can hold them back or hold them
 

503
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,420
we can hold them back or hold them
inside doing that so I'll probably

504
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,430
inside doing that so I'll probably
 

505
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,620
inside doing that so I'll probably
probably do that for little ones and

506
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,630
probably do that for little ones and
 

507
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,190
probably do that for little ones and
have a half slab here maybe we're going

508
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,200
have a half slab here maybe we're going
 

509
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
have a half slab here maybe we're going
to do this for the medium ones but I

510
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:10,850
to do this for the medium ones but I
 

511
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,020
to do this for the medium ones but I
don't think it's going to work because

512
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,030
don't think it's going to work because
 

513
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,060
don't think it's going to work because
these count as full blocks with our

514
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,070
these count as full blocks with our
 

515
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,560
these count as full blocks with our
collision masks we can't hit through

516
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:17,570
collision masks we can't hit through
 

517
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:17,950
collision masks we can't hit through
them

518
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:17,960
them
 

519
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,070
them
can't throw ender pearls through or

520
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,080
can't throw ender pearls through or
 

521
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,430
can't throw ender pearls through or
anything like that I'm having a hard

522
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
anything like that I'm having a hard
 

523
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,820
anything like that I'm having a hard
time making it look good I don't know

524
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:30,830
time making it look good I don't know
 

525
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,950
time making it look good I don't know
what to do like something like that

526
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:35,960
what to do like something like that
 

527
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,530
what to do like something like that
would I believe hold them but that looks

528
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:41,540
would I believe hold them but that looks
 

529
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,480
would I believe hold them but that looks
terrible use nether I think they would

530
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,490
terrible use nether I think they would
 

531
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,070
terrible use nether I think they would
work the same as or have the same basic

532
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,080
work the same as or have the same basic
 

533
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:59,650
work the same as or have the same basic
shape is an iron bar

534
00:15:59,650 --> 00:15:59,660

 

535
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:06,069

yeah I wish I was an invisible block

536
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079

 

537
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480

actually no what I would like to try

538
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,490
actually no what I would like to try
 

539
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,190
actually no what I would like to try
this might work at we have a half slab

540
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,200
this might work at we have a half slab
 

541
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:20,960
this might work at we have a half slab
here one here and water they won't be

542
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:20,970
here one here and water they won't be
 

543
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,759
here one here and water they won't be
able to jump if they're in water and

544
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:22,769
able to jump if they're in water and
 

545
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:26,629
able to jump if they're in water and
that might hold them down and they'll

546
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
that might hold them down and they'll
 

547
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,300
that might hold them down and they'll
drown the little ones will I think the

548
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,310
drown the little ones will I think the
 

549
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,329
drown the little ones will I think the
medium and the large ones would be fine

550
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:32,339
medium and the large ones would be fine
 

551
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,860
medium and the large ones would be fine
though that's an idea that looks that

552
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:36,870
though that's an idea that looks that
 

553
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,290
though that's an idea that looks that
looks a lot better than having these

554
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,300
looks a lot better than having these
 

555
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,100
looks a lot better than having these
bars everywhere or glass or leaves or

556
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,110
bars everywhere or glass or leaves or
 

557
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:52,870
bars everywhere or glass or leaves or
anything like that so you will try that

558
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880

 

559
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,490

I'm just waiting for a big slab to test

560
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm just waiting for a big slab to test
 

561
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,050
I'm just waiting for a big slab to test
this let's see if it will automatically

562
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,060
this let's see if it will automatically
 

563
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,870
this let's see if it will automatically
launch and when it automatically

564
00:16:59,870 --> 00:16:59,880
launch and when it automatically
 

565
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,660
launch and when it automatically
launches we want it to go down here go

566
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,670
launches we want it to go down here go
 

567
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,049
launches we want it to go down here go
over a detector rail the detector rail

568
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:06,059
over a detector rail the detector rail
 

569
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,110
over a detector rail the detector rail
will cause a cart from a stack to

570
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
will cause a cart from a stack to
 

571
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,929
will cause a cart from a stack to
probably go back this way and go into

572
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:11,939
probably go back this way and go into
 

573
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,329
probably go back this way and go into
the position for the next big slide and

574
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:16,339
the position for the next big slide and
 

575
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,520
the position for the next big slide and
if there's an empty cart on them on the

576
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,530
if there's an empty cart on them on the
 

577
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,860
if there's an empty cart on them on the
main loop here a detector will send it

578
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:24,870
main loop here a detector will send it
 

579
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,230
main loop here a detector will send it
back into the stack I think that's the

580
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,240
back into the stack I think that's the
 

581
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,010
back into the stack I think that's the
logic we need to do with this okay so

582
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,020
logic we need to do with this okay so
 

583
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,620
logic we need to do with this okay so
long story short I got a little bit

584
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,630
long story short I got a little bit
 

585
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,600
long story short I got a little bit
frustrated waiting for these guys to

586
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:38,610
frustrated waiting for these guys to
 

587
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,960
frustrated waiting for these guys to
spawn so I went to create a world to

588
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:41,970
spawn so I went to create a world to
 

589
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,690
spawn so I went to create a world to
speed things up a little bit and I built

590
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:44,700
speed things up a little bit and I built
 

591
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,039
speed things up a little bit and I built
this to mimic the drop for the big guys

592
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,049
this to mimic the drop for the big guys
 

593
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,169
this to mimic the drop for the big guys
just having a too high gap here is

594
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:51,179
just having a too high gap here is
 

595
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,020
just having a too high gap here is
enough to keep them in there it looks

596
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,030
enough to keep them in there it looks
 

597
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,200
enough to keep them in there it looks
fairly good with the minecart I'm pretty

598
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,210
fairly good with the minecart I'm pretty
 

599
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,120
fairly good with the minecart I'm pretty
sure I need to use a water stream and

600
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,130
sure I need to use a water stream and
 

601
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,850
sure I need to use a water stream and
the key is I have to have it in motion

602
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:01,860
the key is I have to have it in motion
 

603
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,460
the key is I have to have it in motion
when it picks them up I can't just leave

604
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,470
when it picks them up I can't just leave
 

605
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:12,409
when it picks them up I can't just leave
it sitting there so whoop-whoop die what

606
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:12,419
it sitting there so whoop-whoop die what
 

607
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,970
it sitting there so whoop-whoop die what
I'll probably do is stick a pressure

608
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:13,980
I'll probably do is stick a pressure
 

609
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,810
I'll probably do is stick a pressure
plate in here somewhere and when they

610
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:17,820
plate in here somewhere and when they
 

611
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,570
plate in here somewhere and when they
step on that like right now it's down

612
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:20,580
step on that like right now it's down
 

613
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,180
step on that like right now it's down
that will make a cart come and pick them

614
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,190
that will make a cart come and pick them
 

615
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:31,090
that will make a cart come and pick them
up like that and it will also trigger an

616
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,100
up like that and it will also trigger an
 

617
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,510
up like that and it will also trigger an
RS nor latch for for picking them up

618
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
RS nor latch for for picking them up
 

619
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,620
RS nor latch for for picking them up
right and then when when they're heading

620
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:39,630
right and then when when they're heading
 

621
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,970
right and then when when they're heading
back I think I'll make them go over

622
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:42,980
back I think I'll make them go over
 

623
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,520
back I think I'll make them go over
another pressure plate like if we have

624
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,530
another pressure plate like if we have
 

625
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,280
another pressure plate like if we have
one there that's being press right now

626
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,290
one there that's being press right now
 

627
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,610
one there that's being press right now
from their huge size and that will

628
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:52,620
from their huge size and that will
 

629
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
from their huge size and that will
trigger the RS nor latch back to normal

630
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,630
trigger the RS nor latch back to normal
 

631
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,880
trigger the RS nor latch back to normal
resetting the thing just so that it

632
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:58,890
resetting the thing just so that it
 

633
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,620
resetting the thing just so that it
doesn't keep sending card after card

634
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:00,630
doesn't keep sending card after card
 

635
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,820
doesn't keep sending card after card
after cart we need to control the rate

636
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:04,830
after cart we need to control the rate
 

637
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,140
after cart we need to control the rate
the carts are our scent so it has to

638

the carts are our scent so it has to
 

639
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,630
the carts are our scent so it has to
pick them up and then they have to be

pick them up and then they have to be
 

641
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,770
pick them up and then they have to be
sent away before another card gets sent

642
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:14,780
sent away before another card gets sent
 

643
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,120
sent away before another card gets sent

that's why I think I'll do I think the
RS nor latch is very important for this

668
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,370
RS nor latch is very important for this
 

669
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,600
RS nor latch is very important for this
for the medium guys we can have a

670
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,610
for the medium guys we can have a
 

671
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,269
for the medium guys we can have a
one-block space or we can use water to

672
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:05,279
one-block space or we can use water to
 

673
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,909
one-block space or we can use water to
hold them down we're not sending them in

674
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
hold them down we're not sending them in
 

675
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,039

carts or anything so it's going to be a

676
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:10,049
carts or anything so it's going to be a
 

677
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:15,919
carts or anything so it's going to be a
lot simpler very good okay let's head

lot simpler very good okay let's head
back to the LP world all right so I've

680
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:21,419
back to the LP world all right so I've
 

681
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,180
back to the LP world all right so I've
been messing with this a little bit more

682
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,190
been messing with this a little bit more
 

683
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,310

we can take it out

692
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:37,559
we can take it out
 

693

this block and let water in I don't know
 

697
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,519
this block and let water in I don't know
looks cooler if the water is not running

698
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:46,529
looks cooler if the water is not running
 

699
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,180
looks cooler if the water is not running
though but yeah that'll hold them in

700
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,190
though but yeah that'll hold them in
 

701
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,009
though but yeah that'll hold them in
they can't get through this half half

702
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:52,019
they can't get through this half half
 

703
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,440
they can't get through this half half
block space we can punch them through

704
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,450
block space we can punch them through
 

705
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,990

that pick up their drops through that so

706
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,000
that pick up their drops through that so
 

707
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,960
that pick up their drops through that so
should be good for them for the medium

708
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,970
should be good for them for the medium
 

709
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,070
should be good for them for the medium
guys you might do something like this it

710
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,080
guys you might do something like this it
 

711
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,500
guys you might do something like this it
won't auto kill them but that's not

712
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,510
won't auto kill them but that's not
 

713
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,960
won't auto kill them but that's not
necessarily bad we don't want we don't

714
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:11,970
necessarily bad we don't want we don't
 

715
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,190
necessarily bad we don't want we don't
want to kill them because I'm gonna get

716

all these little slimes running around

718
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:14,549
all these little slimes running around
 

719
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:19,129
all these little slimes running around
all over the place so this will hold

720
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:19,139
all over the place so this will hold
 

721
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:20,220
all over the place so this will hold
them

722

them
 

723
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,990
them
and although another thing I could do is

724
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,000
and although another thing I could do is
 

725
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,480
and although another thing I could do is
just maybe have one stare here and then

726
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,490
just maybe have one stare here and then
 

727
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,379
just maybe have one stare here and then
stare there and one over there

728
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:34,389
stare there and one over there
 

729
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,090
stare there and one over there
just to get that block height so they

730
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,100
just to get that block height so they
 

731
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,389
just to get that block height so they
can't escape and the water will hold

732
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:39,399
can't escape and the water will hold
 

733
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,490
can't escape and the water will hold
them down then we wouldn't need this

734
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:41,500
them down then we wouldn't need this
 

735
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:51,899
them down then we wouldn't need this
I got stairs I do whoa that glitch is

736
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:51,909
I got stairs I do whoa that glitch is
 

737
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:52,830

Auto jumping if we do that let's put

740
00:21:59,519 --> 00:21:59,529
Auto jumping if we do that let's put
 

741
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:03,000

this way I'm worried I'm gonna wreck

742
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,010
this way I'm worried I'm gonna wreck
 

743
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,129
this way I'm worried I'm gonna wreck
some wiring below or something um yeah

some wiring below or something um yeah
 

745
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:11,340
some wiring below or something um yeah
we'll just we'll do that not to get

746
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,350
we'll just we'll do that not to get
 

747
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:20,180
we'll just we'll do that not to get
chances do that OOP oh that's not good

748
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,190
chances do that OOP oh that's not good
 

749
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:33,000
chances do that OOP oh that's not good
that is not good what did we do mmm all

750
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,010
that is not good what did we do mmm all
 

751
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,700
that is not good what did we do mmm all
right good put a stopper there I think

752
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:35,710
right good put a stopper there I think
 

753
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,330
right good put a stopper there I think
ahead sometimes we did destroy one wire

754
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:39,340
ahead sometimes we did destroy one wire
 

755
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:51,030
ahead sometimes we did destroy one wire
I believe here okay

756
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,040

 

757
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,140

this is actually looking pretty good I

758
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,150
this is actually looking pretty good I
 

759
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,870
this is actually looking pretty good I
might keep it like this

760
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
might keep it like this
 

761
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,260
might keep it like this
we got a slime on the way so I want to

762
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,270
we got a slime on the way so I want to
 

763
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,330
we got a slime on the way so I want to
see if this will work

764
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,340
see if this will work
 

765
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:16,930
see if this will work

still not drowning so maybe it's fine
 

771
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,420
still not drowning so maybe it's fine
let's see if this guy will stack yeah

772
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,430

 

773
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,210

okay so he's not drowning that's great
 

775
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:53,520
okay so he's not drowning that's great
we will then put the minecarts over here

776
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,530

 

777
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:59,320

so we'll connect it that way sneak it in

778
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,330
so we'll connect it that way sneak it in
 

779
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,290
so we'll connect it that way sneak it in
and put those there I don't that's

780
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:04,300
and put those there I don't that's
 

781
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,790
and put those there I don't that's
that's kind of a cool effect I like it a

782
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:06,800
that's kind of a cool effect I like it a
 

783
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,380
that's kind of a cool effect I like it a
lot more than the glass anyway and if we

784
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,390
lot more than the glass anyway and if we
 

785
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,300
lot more than the glass anyway and if we
get more medium guys that you will stack

786
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,310
get more medium guys that you will stack
 

787
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,330
get more medium guys that you will stack
there so pretty cool let's out light

788
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,340
there so pretty cool let's out light
 

789
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,240
there so pretty cool let's out light
because we got closed stone underneath

790
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,250
because we got closed stone underneath
 

791
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,560
because we got closed stone underneath
we'll have to stick our button in

792
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:23,570
we'll have to stick our button in
 

793
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,360
we'll have to stick our button in
somewhere here all in all that's isn't

794
