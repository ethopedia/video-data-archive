00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,580
enchantment going for looting three it's
like five knocked back to decent decent

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:28,590
like five knocked back to decent decent

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,840
like five knocked back to decent decent
not bad

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:31,850

 

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,450

alrighty so for today's episode I think

00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,460
alrighty so for today's episode I think
 

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,310
alrighty so for today's episode I think
we will take a little bit of a break

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,320
we will take a little bit of a break
 

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,560
we will take a little bit of a break
from all this timer stuff I've been

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:39,570
from all this timer stuff I've been
 

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,990
from all this timer stuff I've been
doing lately just for just for variety

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,000

 

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,990

just crush the creeper and there's a

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
just crush the creeper and there's a
 

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,170
just crush the creeper and there's a
creeper in there how did you get in

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,180
creeper in there how did you get in
 

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,319
creeper in there how did you get in
there OOP okay well we'll stay clear of

24
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:03,329
there OOP okay well we'll stay clear of
 

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,750
there OOP okay well we'll stay clear of
it let's see if we can kill ya we're

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
it let's see if we can kill ya we're
 

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,490
it let's see if we can kill ya we're
gonna take a break from this can't see

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
gonna take a break from this can't see
 

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,050
gonna take a break from this can't see
me doesn't want to jump now either I

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,060
me doesn't want to jump now either I
 

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,190
me doesn't want to jump now either I
should I hear a few more of them around

32
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
should I hear a few more of them around
 

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
should I hear a few more of them around
they think yeah we'll we'll work on this

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,130
they think yeah we'll we'll work on this
 

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,780
they think yeah we'll we'll work on this
some other time

36
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:23,790
some other time
 

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,320
some other time
pair squirrel has made a video about it

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,330
pair squirrel has made a video about it
 

39
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,010
pair squirrel has made a video about it
how I can do the redstone a lot more

40
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,020
how I can do the redstone a lot more
 

41
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,660
how I can do the redstone a lot more
compact and efficient he seems to have

42
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:32,670
compact and efficient he seems to have
 

43
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,960
compact and efficient he seems to have
it working properly which is good so

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:35,970
it working properly which is good so
 

45
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,749
it working properly which is good so
I'll probably just copy what he's shown

46
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
I'll probably just copy what he's shown
 

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,510
I'll probably just copy what he's shown
so that we can get the timer working

48
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
so that we can get the timer working
 

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,310
so that we can get the timer working
like I want but another day today we

50
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
like I want but another day today we
 

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,800
like I want but another day today we
will you know I can't do it and I gotta

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:48,810
will you know I can't do it and I gotta
 

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,270
will you know I can't do it and I gotta
kill just wouldn't be right there we go

54
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
kill just wouldn't be right there we go
 

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,980
kill just wouldn't be right there we go
for today we'll probably just do small

56
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,990
for today we'll probably just do small
 

57
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,010
for today we'll probably just do small
projects again I got quite a few on mine

58
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
projects again I got quite a few on mine
 

59
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,280
projects again I got quite a few on mine
that I need to do and we may even go to

60
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
that I need to do and we may even go to
 

61
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,960
that I need to do and we may even go to
the nether to work on the blaze farm if

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:07,970
the nether to work on the blaze farm if
 

63
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,260
the nether to work on the blaze farm if
if it works out the first thing I wanted

64
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,270
if it works out the first thing I wanted
 

65
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,949
if it works out the first thing I wanted
to do was hook up that golden door and

66
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:15,959
to do was hook up that golden door and
 

67
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,500
to do was hook up that golden door and
get it actually working so at the moment

68
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,510
get it actually working so at the moment
 

69
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,490
get it actually working so at the moment
I just have a lever controlling it and I

70
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,500
I just have a lever controlling it and I
 

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,140
I just have a lever controlling it and I
stick in look at the wiring down here I

72
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
stick in look at the wiring down here I
 

73
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,400
stick in look at the wiring down here I
think the way I want to do it is just

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,410

 

75
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,580

excuse me I hope you didn't hear that I

76
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:39,590
excuse me I hope you didn't hear that I
 

77
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,900
excuse me I hope you didn't hear that I
was just drinking coffee I'll probably

78
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:44,910
was just drinking coffee I'll probably
 

79
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,490
was just drinking coffee I'll probably
do this like I did the potion room door

80
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:49,500
do this like I did the potion room door
 

81
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,490
do this like I did the potion room door
I just had two buttons on the side I was

82
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,500
I just had two buttons on the side I was
 

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,160
I just had two buttons on the side I was
thinking of doing like pressure plates

84
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,170
thinking of doing like pressure plates
 

85
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,890
thinking of doing like pressure plates
that you walk over to control a T

86
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
that you walk over to control a T
 

87
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,240
that you walk over to control a T
flip-flop and then when you walk on the

88
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,250
flip-flop and then when you walk on the
 

89
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,110
flip-flop and then when you walk on the
other said it closes it so it'd be like

90
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
other said it closes it so it'd be like
 

91
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,050
other said it closes it so it'd be like
open-close open-close type thing but

92
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,060
open-close open-close type thing but
 

93
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,559
open-close open-close type thing but
this wirings kind of in the way so I

94
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:12,569
this wirings kind of in the way so I
 

95
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,270
this wirings kind of in the way so I
think I'll just stick two buttons on

96
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
think I'll just stick two buttons on
 

97
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,160
think I'll just stick two buttons on
this one alright so that's the default

98
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,170
this one alright so that's the default
 

99
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,600
this one alright so that's the default
so we would need to put redstone over

100
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:26,610
so we would need to put redstone over
 

101
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,000
so we would need to put redstone over
there and over here so let's get our

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,010
there and over here so let's get our
 

103
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,000
there and over here so let's get our
proper blocks and I'll probably just

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,010
proper blocks and I'll probably just
 

105
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,229
proper blocks and I'll probably just
hook them up to a T flip-flop two

106
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
hook them up to a T flip-flop two
 

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:48,699
hook them up to a T flip-flop two
redstone there and some over here hmm

108
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:48,709
redstone there and some over here hmm
 

109
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,809
redstone there and some over here hmm
you got to be really careful here

110
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:50,819
you got to be really careful here
 

111
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,429
you got to be really careful here
because this redstone torch is powering

112
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:52,439
because this redstone torch is powering
 

113
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,149
because this redstone torch is powering
this block so I think oh there goes my

114
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
this block so I think oh there goes my
 

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,740
this block so I think oh there goes my
framerate I think to avoid that I'll put

116
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:00,750
framerate I think to avoid that I'll put
 

117
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,350
framerate I think to avoid that I'll put
a block there and then we need to hook

118
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,360
a block there and then we need to hook
 

119
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,390
a block there and then we need to hook
the wiring from the T flip-flop we just

120
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
the wiring from the T flip-flop we just
 

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,179
the wiring from the T flip-flop we just
built up to the wiring for the door and

122
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:11,189
built up to the wiring for the door and
 

123
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,540
built up to the wiring for the door and
it should be done

124
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,550
it should be done
 

125
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:21,730
it should be done
that's simple let's give it a try here

126
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:21,740

 

127
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:31,790

hmm it's working oh that's weird yeah

128
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
hmm it's working oh that's weird yeah
 

129
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,840
hmm it's working oh that's weird yeah
it's working except these buttons are

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:35,850
it's working except these buttons are
 

131
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,850
it's working except these buttons are
causing this corner one to mess up it's

132
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:40,860
causing this corner one to mess up it's
 

133
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,540
causing this corner one to mess up it's
opening last when it shouldn't be

134
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:46,550

 

135
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,610

why don't think it should be doing that

136
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:52,620
why don't think it should be doing that
 

137
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:04,780
why don't think it should be doing that
it's diagonals from the piston weird oh

138
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:04,790

 

139
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,310

I know why because it's sending power to

140
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,320
I know why because it's sending power to
 

141
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:16,240
I know why because it's sending power to
that log we just broke I bet you if I

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,250

 

143
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:24,629

break this one I'll probably work

144
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639

 

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,429

I have no idea why Oh cuz I put that

146
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:29,439
I have no idea why Oh cuz I put that
 

147
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,450
I have no idea why Oh cuz I put that
there and now it's working

148
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:35,460
there and now it's working
 

149
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,129
there and now it's working
hmm so I might do the pressure plates

150
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,139
hmm so I might do the pressure plates
 

151
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,360
hmm so I might do the pressure plates
after all these buttons are interfering

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,370
after all these buttons are interfering
 

153
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,350
after all these buttons are interfering
all right give me a minute all right so

154
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,360
all right give me a minute all right so
 

155
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,119
all right give me a minute all right so
that switch has been made we're using

156
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,129
that switch has been made we're using
 

157
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,309
that switch has been made we're using
pressure plates now instead of the

158
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
pressure plates now instead of the
 

159
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,350
pressure plates now instead of the
buttons on the side of the door seems to

160
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,360
buttons on the side of the door seems to
 

161
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,050
buttons on the side of the door seems to
work really well at the top of the

162
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,060
work really well at the top of the
 

163
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,930
work really well at the top of the
stairs here we have three wooden ones

164
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:56,940
stairs here we have three wooden ones
 

165
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,409
stairs here we have three wooden ones
and over it opens it then on the other

166
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:01,419
and over it opens it then on the other
 

167
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,119
and over it opens it then on the other
side of the door there are three stone

168
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,129
side of the door there are three stone
 

169
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,399
side of the door there are three stone
ones here which close it when you walk

170
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,409
ones here which close it when you walk
 

171
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:10,110
ones here which close it when you walk
over them and then it works in Reverse -

172
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,120
over them and then it works in Reverse -
 

173
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,939
over them and then it works in Reverse -
that way because we're using a T

174
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:11,949
that way because we're using a T
 

175
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,659
that way because we're using a T
flip-flop every time you press it it

176
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:15,669
flip-flop every time you press it it
 

177
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,100
flip-flop every time you press it it
switches so this is the wiring for it

178
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,110
switches so this is the wiring for it
 

179
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,730
switches so this is the wiring for it
turned out pretty nicely above here this

180
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:23,740
turned out pretty nicely above here this
 

181
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,769
turned out pretty nicely above here this
is the stone pressure plates here here

182
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:25,779
is the stone pressure plates here here
 

183
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,619
is the stone pressure plates here here
and here they power this wire which goes

184
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:28,629
and here they power this wire which goes
 

185
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,189
and here they power this wire which goes
underneath the other wiring we had then

186
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:32,199
underneath the other wiring we had then
 

187
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,269
underneath the other wiring we had then
it comes back up over here and then

188
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:35,279
it comes back up over here and then
 

189
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,459
it comes back up over here and then
above the wood is the wooden ones here

190
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:38,469
above the wood is the wooden ones here
 

191
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,390
above the wood is the wooden ones here
here and here so all six pressure plates

192
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
here and here so all six pressure plates
 

193
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,249
here and here so all six pressure plates
joined together on the same wire and

194
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:44,259
joined together on the same wire and
 

195
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,689
joined together on the same wire and
then that goes to this redstone torch

196
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:47,699
then that goes to this redstone torch
 

197
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,170
then that goes to this redstone torch
which controls a piston T flip-flop here

198
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,180
which controls a piston T flip-flop here
 

199
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,740
which controls a piston T flip-flop here
and this is I saw this in a video by

200
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:55,750
and this is I saw this in a video by
 

201
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,990
and this is I saw this in a video by
minecraft addict he found a way I think

202
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
minecraft addict he found a way I think
 

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,409
minecraft addict he found a way I think
he did of he calls it super charging t

204
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:01,419
he did of he calls it super charging t
 

205
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,010
he did of he calls it super charging t
flip-flops because and normally the way

206
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,020
flip-flops because and normally the way
 

207
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,550
flip-flops because and normally the way
that you have them they're unpowered by

208
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
that you have them they're unpowered by
 

209
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,939
that you have them they're unpowered by
default so when you switch them it takes

210
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:13,949
default so when you switch them it takes
 

211
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,950
default so when you switch them it takes
quite a while to switch you gotta wait

212
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
quite a while to switch you gotta wait
 

213
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,909
quite a while to switch you gotta wait
for the button to be pressed but with

214
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:20,919
for the button to be pressed but with
 

215
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,219
for the button to be pressed but with
the supercharged ones you have it

216
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:23,229
the supercharged ones you have it
 

217
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,809
the supercharged ones you have it
powered by default and then you gotta

218
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:27,819
powered by default and then you gotta
 

219
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,930
powered by default and then you gotta
put a button over here then it switches

220
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:30,940
put a button over here then it switches
 

221
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,680
put a button over here then it switches
pretty much instantly

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,690

 

223
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,170

as soon as you press the button so it's

224
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,180
as soon as you press the button so it's
 

225
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,510
as soon as you press the button so it's
much quicker that way in fact I think

226
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
much quicker that way in fact I think
 

227
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,010
much quicker that way in fact I think
okay I could run up the stairs and get

228
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,020
okay I could run up the stairs and get
 

229
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,540
okay I could run up the stairs and get
through the door while it's opening

230
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:47,550
through the door while it's opening
 

231
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,869
through the door while it's opening
let's try it out the double tap still

232
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:53,879
let's try it out the double tap still
 

233
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,409
let's try it out the double tap still
have trouble sprinting yet that break my

234
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
have trouble sprinting yet that break my
 

235
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,020
have trouble sprinting yet that break my
stride that's nice alright so I think

236
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,030
stride that's nice alright so I think
 

237
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,990
stride that's nice alright so I think
that door is done finally we can move on

238
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
that door is done finally we can move on
 

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,939
that door is done finally we can move on
with our lives

240
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:09,949

 

241
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,580

okay another project I wanted to do a

242
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:13,590
okay another project I wanted to do a
 

243
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,379
okay another project I wanted to do a
little bit with is a slime farm here

244
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:15,389
little bit with is a slime farm here
 

245
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,409
little bit with is a slime farm here
this is not the final version like I'm

246
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:18,419
this is not the final version like I'm
 

247
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,790
this is not the final version like I'm
not happy with the way this is right now

248
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:21,800
not happy with the way this is right now
 

249
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,409
not happy with the way this is right now
one feature I wanted to try add was a

250
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:24,419
one feature I wanted to try add was a
 

251
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,629
one feature I wanted to try add was a
slime reducer to get them all to the

252
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
slime reducer to get them all to the
 

253
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,850
slime reducer to get them all to the
smallest size to have that option and

254
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:31,860
smallest size to have that option and
 

255
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,139
smallest size to have that option and
the way I was thinking of doing that

256
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:33,149
the way I was thinking of doing that
 

257
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,420
the way I was thinking of doing that
usually people do a drowning system that

258
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:35,430
usually people do a drowning system that
 

259
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,040
usually people do a drowning system that
shrinks them down but I was thinking of

260
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,050
shrinks them down but I was thinking of
 

261
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,040
shrinks them down but I was thinking of
trying something a little different I'm

262
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,050
trying something a little different I'm
 

263
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,380
trying something a little different I'm
gonna try make a lab a blade rate in

264
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,390
gonna try make a lab a blade rate in
 

265
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,030
gonna try make a lab a blade rate in
that corner there and that should get

266
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
that corner there and that should get
 

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,740
that corner there and that should get
rid of the large slime so they split

268
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,750
rid of the large slime so they split
 

269
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,380
rid of the large slime so they split
into mediums and then beyond that we can

270
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,390
into mediums and then beyond that we can
 

271
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,490
into mediums and then beyond that we can
try shrink the mediums down with a lab

272
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,500
try shrink the mediums down with a lab
 

273
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,370
try shrink the mediums down with a lab
of blade to hopefully so I'm gonna get

274
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,380
of blade to hopefully so I'm gonna get
 

275
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,980
of blade to hopefully so I'm gonna get
start I'm gonna get started on working

276
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:00,990
start I'm gonna get started on working
 

277
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,019
start I'm gonna get started on working
on that and I will be back in a sec yeah

278
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:06,029
on that and I will be back in a sec yeah
 

279
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,370
on that and I will be back in a sec yeah
I think I got all the stuff we need to

280
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,380
I think I got all the stuff we need to
 

281
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,760
I think I got all the stuff we need to
do this should be pretty quick I don't

282
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:10,770
do this should be pretty quick I don't
 

283
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,990
do this should be pretty quick I don't
know if you'll be able to see it working

284
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
know if you'll be able to see it working
 

285
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,819
know if you'll be able to see it working
or not working because it's hard to spot

286
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:16,829
or not working because it's hard to spot
 

287
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:22,310
or not working because it's hard to spot
the slimes in time see I think I'll put

288
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
the slimes in time see I think I'll put
 

289
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,920
the slimes in time see I think I'll put
it over here

290
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:26,930

 

291
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,440

yeah because slimes they have a unique

292
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,450
yeah because slimes they have a unique
 

293
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,060
yeah because slimes they have a unique
characteristic where they won't jump

294
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,070
characteristic where they won't jump
 

295
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,380
characteristic where they won't jump
around when they're in water

296
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,390
around when they're in water
 

297
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,380
around when they're in water
they'll just ride the stream which means

298
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,390
they'll just ride the stream which means
 

299
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,200
they'll just ride the stream which means
we can we don't have to worry about them

300
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,210
we can we don't have to worry about them
 

301
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,900
we can we don't have to worry about them
jumping into the lava like the smaller

302
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:41,910
jumping into the lava like the smaller
 

303
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,430
jumping into the lava like the smaller
ones they should stay put so there

304
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:46,440
ones they should stay put so there
 

305
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,260
ones they should stay put so there
should be should work okay so we gonna

306
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,270
should be should work okay so we gonna
 

307
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:02,060
should be should work okay so we gonna
run it over here and let's see it will

308
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,070
run it over here and let's see it will
 

309
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,070
run it over here and let's see it will
go here like this and make it all nice

310
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,080
go here like this and make it all nice
 

311
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,000
go here like this and make it all nice
and pretty

312
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,010

 

313
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,560

I'm just gonna use a piston to hold the

314
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,570
I'm just gonna use a piston to hold the
 

315
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm just gonna use a piston to hold the
LAV in place see and we need the

316
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:20,610
LAV in place see and we need the
 

317
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,410
LAV in place see and we need the
lavatory four blocks is its maximum

318
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:24,420
lavatory four blocks is its maximum
 

319
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,380
lavatory four blocks is its maximum
distance I think one two three and then

320
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,390
distance I think one two three and then
 

321
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,060
distance I think one two three and then
one more for the air so ya stop there

322
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,070
one more for the air so ya stop there
 

323
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,100
one more for the air so ya stop there
lava goes here then we need the piston

324
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,110
lava goes here then we need the piston
 

325
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,480
lava goes here then we need the piston
over here just use a regular piston and

326
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,490
over here just use a regular piston and
 

327
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,730
over here just use a regular piston and
this is what will power to turn it to

328
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:43,740
this is what will power to turn it to
 

329
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,700
this is what will power to turn it to
turn the LAV oblate on or off and yeah

330
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:49,710
turn the LAV oblate on or off and yeah
 

331
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,420
turn the LAV oblate on or off and yeah
that's it so

332
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:53,430
that's it so
 

333
00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:01,000
that's it so
fill this in gonna be ready to run here

334
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,010

 

335
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,560

lap ah oh no we forgot something I'm

336
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:06,570
lap ah oh no we forgot something I'm
 

337
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,550
lap ah oh no we forgot something I'm
gonna use a sign over here to hold the

338
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
gonna use a sign over here to hold the
 

339
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,090
gonna use a sign over here to hold the
lab up and that'd be nice and simple way

340
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,100
lab up and that'd be nice and simple way
 

341
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,720
lab up and that'd be nice and simple way
of doing it

342
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:16,730

 

343
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,780

oh we got slime coming please be a big

344
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:20,790
oh we got slime coming please be a big
 

345
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,910
oh we got slime coming please be a big
one please be a big one

346
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:22,920
one please be a big one
 

347
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:32,510
one please be a big one
nope ah these guys I don't know try to

348
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:32,520
nope ah these guys I don't know try to
 

349
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,550
nope ah these guys I don't know try to
do the medium ones too somehow

350
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560

 

351
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,930

anyway that's all there is to the big

352
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:38,940
anyway that's all there is to the big
 

353
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,639
anyway that's all there is to the big
ones I think that'll take care of them

354
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:40,649
ones I think that'll take care of them
 

355
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,510
ones I think that'll take care of them
because they're 2.4 blocks tall and they

356
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:44,520
because they're 2.4 blocks tall and they
 

357
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,280
because they're 2.4 blocks tall and they
will be I don't maybe that's too high

358
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,290
will be I don't maybe that's too high
 

359
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,940
will be I don't maybe that's too high
see they'll be on the stair and then the

360
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:52,950
see they'll be on the stair and then the
 

361
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,829
see they'll be on the stair and then the
top corner of them will just graze the

362
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
top corner of them will just graze the
 

363
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,960
top corner of them will just graze the
lava so it might work I'll have to keep

364
00:11:59,960 --> 00:11:59,970
lava so it might work I'll have to keep
 

365
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,270
lava so it might work I'll have to keep
an eye on it

366
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,280

 

367
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,560

all right we got a big one coming see

368
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:09,570
all right we got a big one coming see
 

369
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,520
all right we got a big one coming see
what happens

370
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,530
what happens
 

371
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,740
what happens
oh oh not enough damage darn it move too

372
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:15,750
oh oh not enough damage darn it move too
 

373
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:24,410
oh oh not enough damage darn it move too
quick one it might be because he's sauce

374
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
quick one it might be because he's sauce
 

375
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,270
quick one it might be because he's sauce
and he started moving quicker I have to

376
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,280
and he started moving quicker I have to
 

377
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,700
and he started moving quicker I have to
add one more lava blade these guys I

378
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:34,710
add one more lava blade these guys I
 

379
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,750
add one more lava blade these guys I
wonder if they favor aside or not

380
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
wonder if they favor aside or not
 

381
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,170
wonder if they favor aside or not
doesn't seem like it hmm

382
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,180

 

383
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,520

so I got this set up here to hopefully

384
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,530
so I got this set up here to hopefully
 

385
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,860
so I got this set up here to hopefully
reduce the size of the medium slimes

386
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:48,870
reduce the size of the medium slimes
 

387
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,050
reduce the size of the medium slimes
without killing the little ones when

388
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,060
without killing the little ones when
 

389
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,660
without killing the little ones when
they split we'll have to see how it goes

390
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:53,670
they split we'll have to see how it goes
 

391
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,200
they split we'll have to see how it goes
so does have a piston in it so I can

392
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,210
so does have a piston in it so I can
 

393
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,520
so does have a piston in it so I can
control it and it's very tricky place

394
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,530
control it and it's very tricky place
 

395
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,160
control it and it's very tricky place
this there we go

396
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,170
this there we go
 

397
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,430
this there we go
one two three four in there

398
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
one two three four in there
 

399
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,430
one two three four in there
Oh

400
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440

 

401
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,559

mm that figured something wrong here oh

402
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:15,569
mm that figured something wrong here oh
 

403
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,889
mm that figured something wrong here oh
dang it

404
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:16,899
dang it
 

405
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:26,660
dang it
what happened there one two three four

406
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:26,670

 

407
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:32,360

I'm not sure why it did that

408
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,370

 

409
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,990

all right clean-up on aisle four yeah

410
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,000
all right clean-up on aisle four yeah
 

411
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,249
all right clean-up on aisle four yeah
that's something I didn't know before

412
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:38,259
that's something I didn't know before
 

413
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,129
that's something I didn't know before
apparently lava travels further from a

414
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:41,139
apparently lava travels further from a
 

415
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,939
apparently lava travels further from a
sub lava source and it does from the

416
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:44,949
sub lava source and it does from the
 

417
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,160
sub lava source and it does from the
main source so main source four blocks

418
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,170
main source so main source four blocks
 

419
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,150
main source so main source four blocks
and a sub source is five or a sub stream

420
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
and a sub source is five or a sub stream
 

421
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,800
and a sub source is five or a sub stream
or whatever you want to call it one two

422
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:58,810
or whatever you want to call it one two
 

423
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,939
or whatever you want to call it one two
three four five

424
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:01,949
three four five
 

425
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,269
three four five
very weird I find that weird because

426
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,279
very weird I find that weird because
 

427
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,449
very weird I find that weird because
water doesn't do that let's see one two

428
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:12,459
water doesn't do that let's see one two
 

429
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,740
water doesn't do that let's see one two
three four five six seven eight you

430
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:16,750
three four five six seven eight you
 

431
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,509
three four five six seven eight you
wondering about the cobble it's from

432
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:18,519
wondering about the cobble it's from
 

433
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,559
wondering about the cobble it's from
creeper creeper explosions filler got

434
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:25,569
creeper creeper explosions filler got
 

435
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,269
creeper creeper explosions filler got
cobble all over the place under the

436
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
cobble all over the place under the
 

437
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,559
cobble all over the place under the
ground yeah so that goes eight and if

438
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:34,569
ground yeah so that goes eight and if
 

439
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:40,079
ground yeah so that goes eight and if
you do a sub it also goes eight so that

440
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,089
you do a sub it also goes eight so that
 

441
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,269
you do a sub it also goes eight so that
might be a bug actually that the lab is

442
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:42,279
might be a bug actually that the lab is
 

443
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,569
might be a bug actually that the lab is
going further than it should very

444
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:45,579
going further than it should very
 

445
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:51,240
going further than it should very
strange

446
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,250

 

447
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,610

I guess I'll do it like this I'll have

448
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,620
I guess I'll do it like this I'll have
 

449
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,750
I guess I'll do it like this I'll have
the lab aright here this thing can still

450
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
the lab aright here this thing can still
 

451
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,590
the lab aright here this thing can still
control it listen and hopefully that'll

452
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:04,600
control it listen and hopefully that'll
 

453
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,970
control it listen and hopefully that'll
take care of the medium ones I'll have

454
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:05,980
take care of the medium ones I'll have
 

455
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,640
take care of the medium ones I'll have
to watch this and see what happens

456
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:10,650

 

457
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,110

small one let's make sure he can get

458
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
small one let's make sure he can get
 

459
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,530
small one let's make sure he can get
through because there's about a there's

460
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:16,540
through because there's about a there's
 

461
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,240
through because there's about a there's
a block clearance a little once you get

462
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,250
a block clearance a little once you get
 

463
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,580
a block clearance a little once you get
through that they like to jump if I'm

464
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,590
through that they like to jump if I'm
 

465
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,200
through that they like to jump if I'm
standing here I wonder if that'll be a

466
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,210
standing here I wonder if that'll be a
 

467
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:32,760
standing here I wonder if that'll be a
problem and I added a second Latta blade

468
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:32,770
problem and I added a second Latta blade
 

469
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,230
problem and I added a second Latta blade
here for the big ones because they

470
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
here for the big ones because they
 

471
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,570
here for the big ones because they
weren't taking enough damage I saw I saw

472
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:36,580
weren't taking enough damage I saw I saw
 

473
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,950
weren't taking enough damage I saw I saw
another one go through and he had the

474
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:37,960
another one go through and he had the
 

475
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,000
another one go through and he had the
same problem so we'll leave it at that

476
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,010
same problem so we'll leave it at that
 

477
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,800
same problem so we'll leave it at that
for today and keep an eye on it I guess

478
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:45,810
for today and keep an eye on it I guess
 

479
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:54,660
for today and keep an eye on it I guess
whoa I put some block stoppers at the

480
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:54,670
whoa I put some block stoppers at the
 

481
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,820
whoa I put some block stoppers at the
bottom there to hopefully catch some of

482
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:56,830
bottom there to hopefully catch some of
 

483
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,470
bottom there to hopefully catch some of
the medium and large slimes so we can

484
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
the medium and large slimes so we can
 

485
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,260
the medium and large slimes so we can
see if this works or not but yeah I'm

486
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,270
see if this works or not but yeah I'm
 

487
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,000
see if this works or not but yeah I'm
really starting to think that lava thing

488
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,010
really starting to think that lava thing
 

489
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,610
really starting to think that lava thing
is a glitch because a few minutes later

490
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,620
is a glitch because a few minutes later
 

491
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,130
is a glitch because a few minutes later
here now and it has decided to shorten

492
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,140
here now and it has decided to shorten
 

493
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,740
here now and it has decided to shorten
its toll shorten itself to four blocks

494
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:10,750
its toll shorten itself to four blocks
 

495
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,100
its toll shorten itself to four blocks
instead of the five I don't know what

496
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,110
instead of the five I don't know what
 

497
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,829
instead of the five I don't know what
caused this if it's just it updated or

498
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:16,839
caused this if it's just it updated or
 

499
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,110
caused this if it's just it updated or
what but it's shorter now which is an

500
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,120
what but it's shorter now which is an
 

501
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,850
what but it's shorter now which is an
interesting okay so another thing we

502
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:26,860
interesting okay so another thing we
 

503
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,260
interesting okay so another thing we
might do today or at least start is

504
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,270
might do today or at least start is
 

505
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,560
might do today or at least start is
minecart track for the slimes I would

506
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:34,570
minecart track for the slimes I would
 

507
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,810
minecart track for the slimes I would
like it to go around the tree farm I

508
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:36,820
like it to go around the tree farm I
 

509
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,930
like it to go around the tree farm I
think so all around the edge here all

510
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:39,940
think so all around the edge here all
 

511
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,440
think so all around the edge here all
around that back wall there and then the

512
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,450
around that back wall there and then the
 

513
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,410
around that back wall there and then the
the other side here and it will probably

514
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,420
the other side here and it will probably
 

515
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,900
the other side here and it will probably
come well I still haven't fixed that

516
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:48,910
come well I still haven't fixed that
 

517
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,310
come well I still haven't fixed that
leaf there probably come up here

518
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,320
leaf there probably come up here
 

519
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,090
leaf there probably come up here
somewhere and they'll probably go around

520
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,100
somewhere and they'll probably go around
 

521
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,590
somewhere and they'll probably go around
this area - a little bit I'm doing it

they're random or very nice to look at

536
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,250
they're random or very nice to look at
 

537
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,700
they're random or very nice to look at
in your minecraft places like like these

I'm gonna get started on clearing some

542
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm gonna get started on clearing some
 

543
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,510
I'm gonna get started on clearing some
more land here and hopefully I might go

544
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,520
more land here and hopefully I might go
 

545
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,000
more land here and hopefully I might go
for like a wooden look for the minecart

546
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,010
for like a wooden look for the minecart
 

547
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,570
for like a wooden look for the minecart
track and maybe raise it up a little bit

548
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:48,580
track and maybe raise it up a little bit
 

549
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,330
track and maybe raise it up a little bit
higher than the sandstone here we'll

550
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,340
higher than the sandstone here we'll
 

551
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,390
higher than the sandstone here we'll
have to keep it at least I think we'd

552
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
have to keep it at least I think we'd
 

553
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,980
have to keep it at least I think we'd
put the track over here we need at least

554
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:55,990
put the track over here we need at least
 

555
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,710
put the track over here we need at least
one block away from the trees otherwise

556
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
one block away from the trees otherwise
 

557
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,840
one block away from the trees otherwise
the signs will suffocate in the trees as

558
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:00,850
the signs will suffocate in the trees as
 

559
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,540
the signs will suffocate in the trees as
they go by okay well we finally caught a

they go by okay well we finally caught a
big slime here took a while we're gonna

562
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:09,670
big slime here took a while we're gonna
 

563
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,770
big slime here took a while we're gonna
see if this works or not going to try oh

564
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:15,780
see if this works or not going to try oh
 

565
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,650
see if this works or not going to try oh
I gotta be careful here don't try update

I gotta be careful here don't try update
 

567
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:26,130
I gotta be careful here don't try update
this so it goes out further oh great why

568
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,140
this so it goes out further oh great why
 

569
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,860
this so it goes out further oh great why
does w have to be next to cute give me a

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:31,870
does w have to be next to cute give me a
 

571
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,680
does w have to be next to cute give me a
minute

572
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,690

awesome so we finally go to test this

574
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:35,950
awesome so we finally go to test this
 

575
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,530
awesome so we finally go to test this
I've been waiting for this chance let's

576
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:40,540
I've been waiting for this chance let's
 

577
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,260
I've been waiting for this chance let's
see what happens

578

get out oh he's still lived

580
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,510

 

581
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:57,870

hmm not entirely sure what happened

582
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
hmm not entirely sure what happened
 

583
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:08,550
hmm not entirely sure what happened
there okay it needs some work yet okay

584
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:08,560
there okay it needs some work yet okay
 

585
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,830
there okay it needs some work yet okay
change of plans here I had a new idea

586
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:10,840
change of plans here I had a new idea
 

587
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,020
change of plans here I had a new idea
while clearing this out that I think is

588
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,030
while clearing this out that I think is
 

589
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,740
while clearing this out that I think is
gonna be a lot cooler what we're gonna

590
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:16,750
gonna be a lot cooler what we're gonna
 

591
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,100
gonna be a lot cooler what we're gonna
do we're gonna make the slimes the big

592
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,110
do we're gonna make the slimes the big
 

593
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,890
do we're gonna make the slimes the big
slimes go underneath the half slabs so

594
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:24,900

 

595
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,030

just the top of their heads will be

596
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,040
just the top of their heads will be
 

597
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,180
just the top of their heads will be
sticking out above the half slabs I

598
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,190
sticking out above the half slabs I
 

599
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,900
sticking out above the half slabs I
think you'll look really funny because

600
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:33,910
think you'll look really funny because
 

601
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,390
think you'll look really funny because
they don't take suffocation damage going

602
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
they don't take suffocation damage going
 

603
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,170
they don't take suffocation damage going
through half slabs so we can run a rail

604
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,180
through half slabs so we can run a rail
 

605
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,040
through half slabs so we can run a rail
over here with them in we will have to

606
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,050
over here with them in we will have to
 

607
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,720
over here with them in we will have to
get rid of all these blocks on the side

608
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:45,730
get rid of all these blocks on the side
 

609
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,590
get rid of all these blocks on the side
so otherwise they will suffocate both

610
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
so otherwise they will suffocate both
 

611
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,380
so otherwise they will suffocate both
sides so have it nice and open like that

612
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,390
sides so have it nice and open like that
 

613
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,640
sides so have it nice and open like that
you won't be able to see it though

614
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,650
you won't be able to see it though
 

615
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,180
you won't be able to see it though
because it'll be covered and then you

616
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,190
because it'll be covered and then you
 

617
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,910
because it'll be covered and then you
can have your minecart and basically

618
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:02,920
can have your minecart and basically
 

619
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,800
can have your minecart and basically
you'll just have half slabs above like

620
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:04,810
you'll just have half slabs above like
 

621
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:10,740
you'll just have half slabs above like
that big slimes will be in it and

622
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:10,750
that big slimes will be in it and
 

623
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,170
that big slimes will be in it and
they'll be free to travel underneath the

624
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,180
they'll be free to travel underneath the
 

625
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,250
they'll be free to travel underneath the
half slabs and I think just like their

626
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,260
half slabs and I think just like their
 

627
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,020
half slabs and I think just like their
eyes will be showing it'll look really

628
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,030
eyes will be showing it'll look really
 

629
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,950
eyes will be showing it'll look really
funny I pretty sure so that's the way

630
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
funny I pretty sure so that's the way
 

631
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,390
funny I pretty sure so that's the way
we're gonna do it we'll have them go all

632
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
we're gonna do it we'll have them go all
 

633
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,730
we're gonna do it we'll have them go all
the way around all these areas that I

634
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:26,740
the way around all these areas that I
 

635
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,340
the way around all these areas that I
have the block missing I might make them

636
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,350
have the block missing I might make them
 

637
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,490
have the block missing I might make them
go down Isles - I'm not sure yet because

638
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:32,500
go down Isles - I'm not sure yet because
 

639
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,410
go down Isles - I'm not sure yet because
glowstone will won't suffocate them

640
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,420
glowstone will won't suffocate them
 

641
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,290
glowstone will won't suffocate them
either I don't think so we can have them

642
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,300
either I don't think so we can have them
 

643
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,150
either I don't think so we can have them
go down here the only problem is these

644
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,160
go down here the only problem is these
 

645
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,110
go down here the only problem is these
are evenly spaced it's four blocks so it

646
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
are evenly spaced it's four blocks so it
 

647
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
are evenly spaced it's four blocks so it
wouldn't be symmetrical which might be

648
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,330
wouldn't be symmetrical which might be
 

649
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,380
wouldn't be symmetrical which might be
an issue but yeah I'll basically go all

650
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,390
an issue but yeah I'll basically go all
 

651
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,450
an issue but yeah I'll basically go all
the way around the tree farm and we

652
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:51,460
the way around the tree farm and we
 

653
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,680
the way around the tree farm and we
might make them go a few other places

654
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:52,690
might make them go a few other places
 

655
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:59,140
might make them go a few other places
yet - oh what

656
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,150

 

657
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,660

mmm-hmm let's go over here it's over

658
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:02,670
mmm-hmm let's go over here it's over
 

659
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,080
mmm-hmm let's go over here it's over
here I've changed a bunch of lighting

660
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,090
here I've changed a bunch of lighting
 

661
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,820
here I've changed a bunch of lighting
around so now there's probably a dark

662
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:07,830
around so now there's probably a dark
 

663
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,710
around so now there's probably a dark
spot somewhere we got another one here

664
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
spot somewhere we got another one here
 

665
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
spot somewhere we got another one here
and I have moved the lava

666
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:14,730
and I have moved the lava
 

667
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,310
and I have moved the lava
so instead me in the corner it's it's in

668
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,320
so instead me in the corner it's it's in
 

669
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,840
so instead me in the corner it's it's in
a place where I think they'll stay in it

670
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:20,850
a place where I think they'll stay in it
 

671
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,700
a place where I think they'll stay in it
a little bit longer and we'll see if

672
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,710
a little bit longer and we'll see if
 

673
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:30,020
a little bit longer and we'll see if
that does more damage without causing

674
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,030
that does more damage without causing
 

675
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,020
that does more damage without causing
any slimes to die here we go

676
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,030
any slimes to die here we go
 

677
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,430
any slimes to die here we go
Danny's moving quicker than he should

oh they passed straight through that so

684
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:48,750
oh they passed straight through that so
 

685
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,110
oh they passed straight through that so
I need them to be in the lava longer too

686
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120

 

687
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:01,370

so I should maybe move it um it's tough

688
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:01,380
so I should maybe move it um it's tough
 

689
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,080
so I should maybe move it um it's tough
to move it though cuz I can't put signs

690
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,090
to move it though cuz I can't put signs
 

691
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,580
to move it though cuz I can't put signs
down here or it'll block the water so

692
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:07,590
down here or it'll block the water so
 

693
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,990
down here or it'll block the water so

698
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,010

is a path the slimes will be taking the
 

727
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
is a path the slimes will be taking the
big ones

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,460
there's a ravine to the left here like
 

731
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,560
there's a ravine to the left here like
right next to here so I just got to

732
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,570
right next to here so I just got to
 

733
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,110
right next to here so I just got to
cover this up and it should be okay I

734

eight blocks apart and that's just so if

738
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:50,169
eight blocks apart and that's just so if

00:23:59,940 --> 00:23:59,950
still and I tried it out it works the
 

745
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,710
still and I tried it out it works the
cart will go on its own and I made sure

746
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720

I stayed here while it went around just

748
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:07,870
I stayed here while it went around just
 

749
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,380
I stayed here while it went around just
in case it unloaded or something and

750
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,390
in case it unloaded or something and
 

751
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,289
in case it unloaded or something and
stopped on the track but it was fine it

752
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:13,299
stopped on the track but it was fine it
 

753
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,760
stopped on the track but it was fine it
made it all the way around this other

754
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:14,770
made it all the way around this other
 

755
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,519
made it all the way around this other
side it takes a long time though it's a

756
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:17,529
side it takes a long time though it's a
 

757
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:22,460
side it takes a long time though it's a
big loop so it should be pretty cool

758
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,470
big loop so it should be pretty cool
 

759
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,620
big loop so it should be pretty cool
we just need to hook it up to our slime

thing here we know how to get them into
 

763
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,880
thing here we know how to get them into
the carts already we just need to figure

764
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:29,890
the carts already we just need to figure
 

765
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:39,930
the carts already we just need to figure
out how we're doing this front good cool

771
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:53,430
the carts going around I don't think
it's far enough away yeah so that's

772

it's far enough away yeah so that's
 

773
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,340
it's far enough away yeah so that's
that's gonna be cool
