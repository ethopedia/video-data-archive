164
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:21,419
probably like what etho has a underwater
 

165
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,259
probably like what etho has a underwater
base since when

166
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:23,269
base since when
 

167
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,849
base since when
uh-huh yeah it's true we haven't done a

168
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:25,859
uh-huh yeah it's true we haven't done a
 

169
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,909
uh-huh yeah it's true we haven't done a
lot on it to be honest this is it just

170
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:28,919
lot on it to be honest this is it just
 

171
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,220
lot on it to be honest this is it just
this you built an underwater tree farm

172
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,230
this you built an underwater tree farm
 

173
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,460
this you built an underwater tree farm
that works and we did like a mob system

174
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,470
that works and we did like a mob system
 

175
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,500
that works and we did like a mob system
here that's not finished but uh yeah so

176
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,510
here that's not finished but uh yeah so
 

177
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,319
here that's not finished but uh yeah so
I finally figured out what I want to do

178
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,329
I finally figured out what I want to do
 

179
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,819
I finally figured out what I want to do
with this base though I came up with a

180
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:43,829
with this base though I came up with a
 

181
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,879
with this base though I came up with a
pretty good idea I think so we got the

182
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:46,889
pretty good idea I think so we got the
 

183
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,909
pretty good idea I think so we got the
plan now we just got to get the building

184
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:48,919
plan now we just got to get the building
 

185
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,369
plan now we just got to get the building
I'm not gonna go into detail of the plan

186
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:52,379
I'm not gonna go into detail of the plan
 

187
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,289
I'm not gonna go into detail of the plan
just yet cuz it might be a hurt a bit

188
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,299
just yet cuz it might be a hurt a bit
 

189
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,089
just yet cuz it might be a hurt a bit
hard to explain without setting it up

190
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:56,099
hard to explain without setting it up
 

191
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,409
hard to explain without setting it up
first a bit better but I have a

192
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:00,419
first a bit better but I have a
 

193
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,659
first a bit better but I have a
direction to go now so I think we're

194
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:02,669
direction to go now so I think we're
 

195
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,369
direction to go now so I think we're
gonna work on this mob system first stop

196
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:04,379
gonna work on this mob system first stop
 

197
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,030
gonna work on this mob system first stop
it's not really functional at the moment

198
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
it's not really functional at the moment
 

199
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,349
it's not really functional at the moment
first question I have is what glass

200
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:09,359
first question I have is what glass
 

201
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,270
first question I have is what glass
should we use for it's like what's the

202
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
should we use for it's like what's the
 

203
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
should we use for it's like what's the
most transparent glass for underwater

204
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,290
most transparent glass for underwater
 

205
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,000
most transparent glass for underwater
stuff

206
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,010
stuff
 

207
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,790
stuff
this is blue glass this is clear glass

208
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:18,800
this is blue glass this is clear glass
 

209
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,130
this is blue glass this is clear glass
light gray gray and whites

210
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,140
light gray gray and whites
 

211
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,630
light gray gray and whites
I'm thinking we might want to go or the

212
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm thinking we might want to go or the
 

213
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm thinking we might want to go or the
clear actually like now that we don't

214
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,650
clear actually like now that we don't
 

215
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,080
clear actually like now that we don't
have all the streaks through clear glass

216
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,090
have all the streaks through clear glass
 

217
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,810
have all the streaks through clear glass
in the new texture pack it actually

218
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:34,820
in the new texture pack it actually
 

219
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,440
in the new texture pack it actually
doesn't look too bad

220
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,450
doesn't look too bad
 

221
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,440
doesn't look too bad
right we do have the lines though whoa

222
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,450

 

223
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,790

yep yep so I think that's what we're

224
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:45,800
yep yep so I think that's what we're
 

225
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,840
yep yep so I think that's what we're
gonna do here we're gonna have clear

226
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:46,850
gonna do here we're gonna have clear
 

227
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,360
gonna do here we're gonna have clear
glass with the I think light gray clay

228
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,370
glass with the I think light gray clay
 

229
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,470
glass with the I think light gray clay
bordering it and then red clay kind of

230
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:53,480
bordering it and then red clay kind of
 

231
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,210
bordering it and then red clay kind of
sticking out just to give it a bit of 3d

232
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,220
sticking out just to give it a bit of 3d
 

233
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,830
sticking out just to give it a bit of 3d
depth you know so it comes out of block

234
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,840
depth you know so it comes out of block
 

235
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,430
depth you know so it comes out of block
I did try over here as well just to keep

236
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
I did try over here as well just to keep
 

237
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,910
I did try over here as well just to keep
it flat which is fine as well but it's a

238
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:03,920
it flat which is fine as well but it's a
 

239
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,900
it flat which is fine as well but it's a
little bit more plain right so that's

240
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:07,910
little bit more plain right so that's
 

241
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,890
little bit more plain right so that's
how this is gonna go what the plan is

242
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:10,900
how this is gonna go what the plan is
 

243
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,030
how this is gonna go what the plan is
it's pretty simple we're gonna make them

244
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,040
it's pretty simple we're gonna make them
 

245
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,860
it's pretty simple we're gonna make them
go up about 20 blocks or so and then

246
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:14,870
go up about 20 blocks or so and then
 

247
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,160
go up about 20 blocks or so and then
drop them they'll probably be some kind

248
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,170
drop them they'll probably be some kind
 

249
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,990
drop them they'll probably be some kind
of mob separator at the top of this

250
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
of mob separator at the top of this
 

251
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,720
of mob separator at the top of this
eventually but for right now we're just

252
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:22,730
eventually but for right now we're just
 

253
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,000
eventually but for right now we're just
gonna drop them to either a one-hit kill

254
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,010
gonna drop them to either a one-hit kill
 

255
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:40,880
gonna drop them to either a one-hit kill
or to kill them for their mob drops

256
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:40,890

 

257
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,260

okay good stuff so we're just about done

258
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,270
okay good stuff so we're just about done
 

259
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,030
okay good stuff so we're just about done
building our tube here we can start

260
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,040
building our tube here we can start
 

261
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,670
building our tube here we can start
killing these move these mobs what we're

262
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
killing these move these mobs what we're
 

263
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,140
killing these move these mobs what we're
gonna do is get rid of the water in here

264
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,150
gonna do is get rid of the water in here
 

265
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,960
gonna do is get rid of the water in here
a little bit's alright and we're gonna

266
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:54,970
a little bit's alright and we're gonna
 

267
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,730
a little bit's alright and we're gonna
get rid of water over here mobs are down

268
00:05:59,730 --> 00:05:59,740
get rid of water over here mobs are down
 

269
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
get rid of water over here mobs are down
there right they'll swim up through the

270
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:01,750
there right they'll swim up through the
 

271
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,480
there right they'll swim up through the
bubble stream get to the top here then

272
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,490
bubble stream get to the top here then
 

273
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,860
bubble stream get to the top here then
this water currents gonna take them over

274
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:04,870
this water currents gonna take them over
 

275
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,500
this water currents gonna take them over
to here let's extend this doesn't one

276
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:10,510
to here let's extend this doesn't one
 

277
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:17,250
to here let's extend this doesn't one
update over here that work yeah okay so

278
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,260
update over here that work yeah okay so
 

279
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,450
update over here that work yeah okay so
it makes it all the way to the edge here

280
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,460
it makes it all the way to the edge here
 

281
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,250
it makes it all the way to the edge here
and then we go down uh-huh so they're

282
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,260
and then we go down uh-huh so they're
 

283
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,140
and then we go down uh-huh so they're
gonna go up the bubble stream here to

284
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,150
gonna go up the bubble stream here to
 

285
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,330
gonna go up the bubble stream here to
the top if there's no mob separator

286
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:27,340
the top if there's no mob separator
 

287
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,190
the top if there's no mob separator
active they'll just go down over to here

288
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,200
active they'll just go down over to here
 

289
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,830
active they'll just go down over to here
and fall down and either die or not die

290
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
and fall down and either die or not die
 

291
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,630
and fall down and either die or not die
if we want to kill them ourselves for XP

292
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:35,640
if we want to kill them ourselves for XP
 

293
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,100
if we want to kill them ourselves for XP
but I think it's about ready here to

294
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,110
but I think it's about ready here to
 

295
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,800
but I think it's about ready here to
test out so let's let's do the nasty

296
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:40,810
test out so let's let's do the nasty
 

297
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,320
test out so let's let's do the nasty
thing here and let them up there we go

298
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,330
thing here and let them up there we go
 

299
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,540
thing here and let them up there we go
we replace the water because it's

300
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,550
we replace the water because it's
 

301
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,170
we replace the water because it's
missing there put it back over there

302
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,180
missing there put it back over there
 

303
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,320
missing there put it back over there
another bucket back here them dying

304
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,330
another bucket back here them dying
 

305
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,070
another bucket back here them dying
right now okay so I think that'll work I

306
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
right now okay so I think that'll work I
 

307
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,300
right now okay so I think that'll work I
mean yeah they're going up to the top

308
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,310
mean yeah they're going up to the top
 

309
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,530
mean yeah they're going up to the top
it's airspace here so they fall down now

310
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:10,540
it's airspace here so they fall down now
 

311
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,910
it's airspace here so they fall down now
what I'm trying to do is find the sweet

312
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:11,920
what I'm trying to do is find the sweet
 

313
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,810
what I'm trying to do is find the sweet
spot where you hear they're dying right

314
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:15,820
spot where you hear they're dying right
 

315
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,130
spot where you hear they're dying right
now where they won't die unless we smack

316
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,140
now where they won't die unless we smack
 

317
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,380
now where they won't die unless we smack
them once okay so we got it figured out

318
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,390
them once okay so we got it figured out
 

319
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,390
them once okay so we got it figured out
here the sweet spot is right where that

320
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
here the sweet spot is right where that
 

321
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,150
here the sweet spot is right where that
red clay is so on the back we're gonna

322
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,160
red clay is so on the back we're gonna
 

323
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,460
red clay is so on the back we're gonna
have some sticky pistons that will

324
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,470
have some sticky pistons that will
 

325
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,830
have some sticky pistons that will
extend and push the blocks if we want

326
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
extend and push the blocks if we want
 

327
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,990
extend and push the blocks if we want
the mobs to land at this level and not

328
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
the mobs to land at this level and not
 

329
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
the mobs to land at this level and not
die we want to firm them for XP

330
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,210
die we want to firm them for XP
 

331
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,250
die we want to firm them for XP
otherwise it'll stay open like this and

332
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,260
otherwise it'll stay open like this and
 

333
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,160
otherwise it'll stay open like this and
we'll just fall down and die and the

334
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,170
we'll just fall down and die and the
 

335
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,670
we'll just fall down and die and the
drops will go into a hopper somewhere so

336
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
drops will go into a hopper somewhere so
 

337
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,380
drops will go into a hopper somewhere so
at this level that means we'll probably

338
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,390
at this level that means we'll probably
 

339
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,960
at this level that means we'll probably
want to build a room over here with a

340
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:48,970
want to build a room over here with a
 

341
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,960
want to build a room over here with a
floor where the glasses and we're

342
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:51,970
floor where the glasses and we're
 

343
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,580
floor where the glasses and we're
also gonna need to be able to swing in

344
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:53,590
also gonna need to be able to swing in
 

345
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,810
also gonna need to be able to swing in
there and kill them so we'll probably

346
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:54,820
there and kill them so we'll probably
 

347
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:01,010
there and kill them so we'll probably
just just try this for now

348
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,020

 

349
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,970

maybe we'll just try to keep it open

350
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:02,980
maybe we'll just try to keep it open
 

351
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,540
maybe we'll just try to keep it open
like this and see how that works

352
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,550
like this and see how that works
 

353
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,980
like this and see how that works
cuz XP needs to be able to flow out of

354
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:07,990
cuz XP needs to be able to flow out of
 

355
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,640
cuz XP needs to be able to flow out of
there too

356
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:08,650
there too
 

357
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,940
there too
now one of the big things we're gonna

358
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:11,950
now one of the big things we're gonna
 

359
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,650
now one of the big things we're gonna
have to deal with when building

360
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:13,660
have to deal with when building
 

361
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,090
have to deal with when building
underwater is how are we gonna do

362
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,100
underwater is how are we gonna do
 

363
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,590
underwater is how are we gonna do
redstone like we got to power these

364
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:16,600
redstone like we got to power these
 

365
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,440
redstone like we got to power these
Pistons somehow and we don't want to put

366
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,450
Pistons somehow and we don't want to put
 

367
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,360
Pistons somehow and we don't want to put
a giant casing around some redstone

368
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,370
a giant casing around some redstone
 

369
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,600
a giant casing around some redstone
that'll look pretty nasty so I don't

370
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,610
that'll look pretty nasty so I don't
 

371
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,130
that'll look pretty nasty so I don't
know if this is a well-known trick but

372
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,140
know if this is a well-known trick but
 

373
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,620
know if this is a well-known trick but
this is a trick we're gonna be using

374
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,630
this is a trick we're gonna be using
 

375
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,320
this is a trick we're gonna be using
extensively throughout our base I

376
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,330
extensively throughout our base I
 

377
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,029
extensively throughout our base I
realized what we can do is just put some

378
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
realized what we can do is just put some
 

379
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,740
realized what we can do is just put some
observers under these Pistons like so

380
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:36,750
observers under these Pistons like so
 

381
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,940
observers under these Pistons like so
detector side over here and these

382
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:41,950
detector side over here and these
 

383
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,010
detector side over here and these
actually get updated by bubble streams

384
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,020
actually get updated by bubble streams
 

385
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,140
actually get updated by bubble streams
if you don't know that

386
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,150
if you don't know that
 

387
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,300
if you don't know that
so if we have soul sand down here this

388
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,310
so if we have soul sand down here this
 

389
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,620
so if we have soul sand down here this
will have to be filled with water though

390
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:52,630
will have to be filled with water though
 

391
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,980
will have to be filled with water though
of course and when the bubbles reach the

392
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:58,990
of course and when the bubbles reach the
 

393
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,540
of course and when the bubbles reach the
observers up there it actually activates

394
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,550
observers up there it actually activates
 

395
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,760
observers up there it actually activates
the Pistons so now you see it's extended

396
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:02,770
the Pistons so now you see it's extended
 

397
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,110
the Pistons so now you see it's extended
and like if we want to switch it we

398
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
and like if we want to switch it we
 

399
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,870
and like if we want to switch it we
either move the soul sand or cover it or

400
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:09,880
either move the soul sand or cover it or
 

401
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,630
either move the soul sand or cover it or
something and then look trigger again so

402
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
something and then look trigger again so
 

403
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,000
something and then look trigger again so
it's like vertical redstone through

404
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,010
it's like vertical redstone through
 

405
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,150
it's like vertical redstone through
water which is amazing so we're gonna be

406
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
water which is amazing so we're gonna be
 

407
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
water which is amazing so we're gonna be
using that trick a lot I thought that

408
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:19,930
using that trick a lot I thought that
 

409
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,240
using that trick a lot I thought that
was pretty cool I guess let's trigger it

410
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,250
was pretty cool I guess let's trigger it
 

411
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,780
was pretty cool I guess let's trigger it
one more time probably picking Pistons

412
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:27,790
one more time probably picking Pistons
 

413
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,370
one more time probably picking Pistons
up to the soul sand here is gonna be the

414
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:29,380
up to the soul sand here is gonna be the
 

415
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,680
up to the soul sand here is gonna be the
best method so if we put a block at the

416
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:31,690
best method so if we put a block at the
 

417
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,410
best method so if we put a block at the
top it destroys the water source those

418
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,420
top it destroys the water source those
 

419
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,940
top it destroys the water source those
are extended yen so let's see how this

420
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:38,950
are extended yen so let's see how this
 

421
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,980
are extended yen so let's see how this
thing performs these guys the zombies

422
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:40,990
thing performs these guys the zombies
 

423
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,900
thing performs these guys the zombies
won't be a one-hit kill because they

424
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:42,910
won't be a one-hit kill because they
 

425
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,280
won't be a one-hit kill because they
have a little bit of armor but all the

426
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,290
have a little bit of armor but all the
 

427
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,070
have a little bit of armor but all the
other mobs will these guys will be like

428
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,080
other mobs will these guys will be like
 

429
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,070
other mobs will these guys will be like
two hits probably it doesn't really

430
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
two hits probably it doesn't really
 

431
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,450
two hits probably it doesn't really
matter too much show cuz we're gonna be

432
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:51,460
matter too much show cuz we're gonna be
 

433
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,070
matter too much show cuz we're gonna be
using a sword to kill these guys anyway

434
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,080
using a sword to kill these guys anyway
 

435
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,720
using a sword to kill these guys anyway
so if they're not exactly a one punch

436
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:54,730
so if they're not exactly a one punch
 

437
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,920
so if they're not exactly a one punch
kill no biggie

438
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:57,930

 

439
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,449

yeah anyways let's give this a try so we

440
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:00,459
yeah anyways let's give this a try so we
 

441
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,340
yeah anyways let's give this a try so we
want the XP to flow out of here we don't

442
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,350
want the XP to flow out of here we don't
 

443
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,749
want the XP to flow out of here we don't
really want the items to land on the

444
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:03,759
really want the items to land on the
 

445
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,239
really want the items to land on the
calamus there's any way to stomp that

446
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,249
calamus there's any way to stomp that
 

447
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:10,859
calamus there's any way to stomp that
like you see other zombie flesh is on

448
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:10,869
like you see other zombie flesh is on
 

449
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,309
like you see other zombie flesh is on
the glass there that's not really ideal

450
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:13,319
the glass there that's not really ideal
 

451
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,410
the glass there that's not really ideal
because we're gonna we're gonna trigger

452
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:16,420
because we're gonna we're gonna trigger
 

453
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,900
because we're gonna we're gonna trigger
the red clay there to move back and then

454
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:18,910
the red clay there to move back and then
 

455
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,369
the red clay there to move back and then
the drops will fall down every so often

456
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:20,379
the drops will fall down every so often
 

457
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:24,179
the drops will fall down every so often
we're using this oh yeah looks like the

458
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:24,189
we're using this oh yeah looks like the
 

459
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,939
we're using this oh yeah looks like the
XP flows out no problem which is great

460
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:26,949
XP flows out no problem which is great
 

461
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,929
XP flows out no problem which is great
the other thing we got to worry about is

462
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:30,939
the other thing we got to worry about is
 

463
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,879
the other thing we got to worry about is
we need to be able to activate the

464
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:32,889
we need to be able to activate the
 

465
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,290
we need to be able to activate the
redstone with this like if we want to

466
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,300
redstone with this like if we want to
 

467
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,350
redstone with this like if we want to
control this thing the problem is like

468
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,360
control this thing the problem is like
 

469
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,299
control this thing the problem is like
if you're doing redstone under water

470
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:42,309
if you're doing redstone under water
 

471
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,179
if you're doing redstone under water
again that legging just plays a button

472
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:45,189
again that legging just plays a button
 

473
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:48,389
again that legging just plays a button
you know right so we need some sort of

474
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
you know right so we need some sort of
 

475
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,799
you know right so we need some sort of
button like device that works underwater

476
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:51,809
button like device that works underwater
 

477
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,809
button like device that works underwater
and I think trapdoors are a good option

478
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:54,819
and I think trapdoors are a good option
 

479
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:57,269
and I think trapdoors are a good option
for that or I think we might just use

480
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
for that or I think we might just use
 

481
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,869
for that or I think we might just use
note blocks a lot too peoples are like

482
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:00,879
note blocks a lot too peoples are like
 

483
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,179
note blocks a lot too peoples are like
two of the best choices you could use

484
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:03,189
two of the best choices you could use
 

485
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:06,259
two of the best choices you could use
fence gates and some other stuff as well

486
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:06,269
fence gates and some other stuff as well
 

487
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:11,249
fence gates and some other stuff as well
I like the way we could control this is

488
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:11,259
I like the way we could control this is
 

489
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,079
I like the way we could control this is
have note blocks if you right-click them

490
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:13,089
have note blocks if you right-click them
 

491
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,540
have note blocks if you right-click them
they don't play a sound because there's

492
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,550
they don't play a sound because there's
 

493
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,549
they don't play a sound because there's
a water block above and they need to

494
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:17,559
a water block above and they need to
 

495
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,970
a water block above and they need to
have a air block above to work but they

496
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:20,980
have a air block above to work but they
 

497
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,749
have a air block above to work but they
will still trigger an observer so

498
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:24,759
will still trigger an observer so
 

499
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,139
will still trigger an observer so
basically we run this down and then we

500
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:28,149
basically we run this down and then we
 

501
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,389
basically we run this down and then we
make it activate a piston to move the

502
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
make it activate a piston to move the
 

503
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,090
make it activate a piston to move the
soul sand here yeah so check this out

504
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,100
soul sand here yeah so check this out
 

505
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,470
soul sand here yeah so check this out
this is actually gonna be pretty simple

506
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
this is actually gonna be pretty simple
 

507
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,869
this is actually gonna be pretty simple
to do we'll have the note blocks over

508
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:36,879
to do we'll have the note blocks over
 

509
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,249
to do we'll have the note blocks over
here easy to click at this level right

510
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:40,259
here easy to click at this level right
 

511
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,220
here easy to click at this level right
observers going down we can easily put

512
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,230
observers going down we can easily put
 

513
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,749
observers going down we can easily put
some blocks in front of these if we want

514
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:45,759
some blocks in front of these if we want
 

515
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,859
some blocks in front of these if we want
to hide them and this guy there's some

516
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:52,869
to hide them and this guy there's some
 

517
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,809
to hide them and this guy there's some
blocks down here and he's messing with

518
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:54,819
blocks down here and he's messing with
 

519
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:56,040
blocks down here and he's messing with
them

520
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,050
them
 

521
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,800
them
let me get those for you guy yeah all

522
00:11:59,800 --> 00:11:59,810
let me get those for you guy yeah all
 

523
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,400
let me get those for you guy yeah all
right so server comes down I put some

524
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,410
right so server comes down I put some
 

525
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,620
right so server comes down I put some
sticky pistons over here and the sole

526
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,630
sticky pistons over here and the sole
 

527
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,040
sticky pistons over here and the sole
stands right next to it so basically all

528
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,050
stands right next to it so basically all
 

529
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,050
stands right next to it so basically all
we got to do put some sand stone there

530
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,060
we got to do put some sand stone there
 

531
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,190
we got to do put some sand stone there
make sure this is air I did not grab any

532
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,200
make sure this is air I did not grab any
 

533
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,660
make sure this is air I did not grab any
redstone some reason let's grab some

534
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,670
redstone some reason let's grab some
 

535
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,220
redstone some reason let's grab some
redstone 2 pieces in here that'll power

536
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,230
redstone 2 pieces in here that'll power
 

537
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,770
redstone 2 pieces in here that'll power
the Pistons and then this will come down

538
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:26,780
the Pistons and then this will come down
 

539
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,970
the Pistons and then this will come down
I think we just need to put a block over

540
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:30,980
I think we just need to put a block over
 

541
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,400
I think we just need to put a block over
there that'll send power to the redstone

542
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,410
there that'll send power to the redstone
 

543
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,510
there that'll send power to the redstone
dust now and I think it's about good to

544
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:37,520
dust now and I think it's about good to
 

545
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,840
dust now and I think it's about good to
go here fill that back in so let's give

546
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:43,850
go here fill that back in so let's give
 

547
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,980
go here fill that back in so let's give
it a try so if we just right click yeah

548
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:47,990
it a try so if we just right click yeah
 

549
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,050
it a try so if we just right click yeah
look at that amazing a little bit of

550
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,060
look at that amazing a little bit of
 

551
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,280
look at that amazing a little bit of
delay to it because the bubble stream

552
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,290
delay to it because the bubble stream
 

553
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,980
delay to it because the bubble stream
doesn't activate instantly but it's it's

554
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:56,990
doesn't activate instantly but it's it's
 

555
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,860
doesn't activate instantly but it's it's
pretty good good stuff alright so now

556
00:12:59,860 --> 00:12:59,870
pretty good good stuff alright so now
 

557
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,930
pretty good good stuff alright so now
that we got this built we have a source

558
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:01,940
that we got this built we have a source
 

559
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,390
that we got this built we have a source
of XP at our base here it means we can

560
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,400
of XP at our base here it means we can
 

561
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,730
of XP at our base here it means we can
repair our tools without having to leave

562
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:06,740
repair our tools without having to leave
 

563
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,260
repair our tools without having to leave
the area and be super useful also we got

564
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,270
the area and be super useful also we got
 

565
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,910
the area and be super useful also we got
a bit more to do on this we want to add

566
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:12,920
a bit more to do on this we want to add
 

567
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,620
a bit more to do on this we want to add
a collection system for all these drops

568
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:14,630
a collection system for all these drops
 

569
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,400
a collection system for all these drops
and that that'll sort them as well and I

570
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,410
and that that'll sort them as well and I
 

571
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,830
and that that'll sort them as well and I
also want to add a way of turning the

572
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:20,840
also want to add a way of turning the
 

573
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,450
also want to add a way of turning the
farm on and off I think by putting

574
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,460
farm on and off I think by putting
 

575
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,910
farm on and off I think by putting
lights down at the spawning levels and

576
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:24,920
lights down at the spawning levels and
 

577
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,270
lights down at the spawning levels and
will control that here too probably

578
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,280
will control that here too probably
 

579
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,040
will control that here too probably
but for a bit of variety let's actually

580
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,050
but for a bit of variety let's actually
 

581
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,570
but for a bit of variety let's actually
try to build something at this base

582
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,580
try to build something at this base
 

583
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,000
try to build something at this base
besides this I'm thinking now that we

584
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,010
besides this I'm thinking now that we
 

585
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,290
besides this I'm thinking now that we
have a source of XP here we're gonna

586
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,300
have a source of XP here we're gonna
 

587
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,060
have a source of XP here we're gonna
want to spend it right so let's maybe

588
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,070
want to spend it right so let's maybe
 

589
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,370
want to spend it right so let's maybe
put an enchanting room next to this I

590
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,380
put an enchanting room next to this I
 

591
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,910
put an enchanting room next to this I
think would be a good idea and I was

592
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:42,920
think would be a good idea and I was
 

593
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
think would be a good idea and I was
looking into it it's actually kind of

594
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:44,570
looking into it it's actually kind of
 

595
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,070
looking into it it's actually kind of
complicated it's not as easy as I

596
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,080
complicated it's not as easy as I
 

597
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,310
complicated it's not as easy as I
thought

598
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
thought
 

599
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,430
thought
like enchanting tables require air

600
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
like enchanting tables require air
 

601
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,460
like enchanting tables require air
spaces actually the work and more than I

602
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:54,470
spaces actually the work and more than I
 

603
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,420
spaces actually the work and more than I
thought like if you put it in Genting

604
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,430
thought like if you put it in Genting
 

605
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,070
thought like if you put it in Genting
table like this

606
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,080
table like this
 

607
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,870
table like this
only goes up to level five all right

608
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:01,880
only goes up to level five all right
 

609
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,910
only goes up to level five all right
these don't actually get registered even

610
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
these don't actually get registered even
 

611
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,490
these don't actually get registered even
though they're in the right position I

612
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:05,500
though they're in the right position I
 

613
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,100
though they're in the right position I
check it against the level five right

614
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,110
check it against the level five right
 

615
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,350
check it against the level five right
you know maybe let's go up to the

616
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
you know maybe let's go up to the
 

617
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,780
you know maybe let's go up to the
surface

618
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:12,790
surface
 

619
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,519
surface
does this go up I guess it does okay

620
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:15,529
does this go up I guess it does okay
 

621
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,860
does this go up I guess it does okay
great let's go let's go onto my hand

622
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:17,870
great let's go let's go onto my hand
 

623
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,110
great let's go let's go onto my hand
here it'd be a little easier to

624
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,120
here it'd be a little easier to
 

625
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,870
here it'd be a little easier to
demonstrate this yeah so check this out

626
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
demonstrate this yeah so check this out
 

627
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,389
demonstrate this yeah so check this out
if we put down a bookshelf like we had

628
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:25,399
if we put down a bookshelf like we had
 

629
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,430
if we put down a bookshelf like we had
before there now it goes up to level

630
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
before there now it goes up to level
 

631
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,990
before there now it goes up to level
seven right there's a couple blocks that

632
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
seven right there's a couple blocks that
 

633
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,660
seven right there's a couple blocks that
still don't get waterlogged like

634
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:34,670
still don't get waterlogged like
 

635
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,269
still don't get waterlogged like
pressure plates right so they're kind of

636
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
pressure plates right so they're kind of
 

637
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
pressure plates right so they're kind of
like air blocks but they're they don't

638
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:38,810
like air blocks but they're they don't
 

639
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,889
like air blocks but they're they don't
count for enchanting it has to be a pure

640
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:41,899
count for enchanting it has to be a pure
 

641
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,680
count for enchanting it has to be a pure
air block not just like a mostly air

642
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:44,690
air block not just like a mostly air
 

643
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,420
air block not just like a mostly air
block right so if we put that in front

644
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,430
block right so if we put that in front
 

645
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,070
block right so if we put that in front
there you see it goes down to five so

646
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,080
there you see it goes down to five so
 

647
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,500
there you see it goes down to five so
this actually cancels out the bookshelf

648
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,510
this actually cancels out the bookshelf
 

649
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,720
this actually cancels out the bookshelf
so we can't do any tricks like that and

650
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:52,730
so we can't do any tricks like that and
 

651
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,920
so we can't do any tricks like that and
also it's two vertical air blocks we

652
00:14:59,920 --> 00:14:59,930
also it's two vertical air blocks we
 

653
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,199
also it's two vertical air blocks we
need I thought it was only like it next

654
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:02,209
need I thought it was only like it next
 

655
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,840
need I thought it was only like it next
to the bookshelf like we need these two

656
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:04,850
to the bookshelf like we need these two
 

657
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,290
to the bookshelf like we need these two
blocks to be air box if we put like this

658
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,300
blocks to be air box if we put like this
 

659
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,380
blocks to be air box if we put like this
there you see it still goes down to five

660
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,390
there you see it still goes down to five
 

661
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,670
there you see it still goes down to five
if that's gone it'll be at seven so how

662
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
if that's gone it'll be at seven so how
 

663
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,860
if that's gone it'll be at seven so how
do we get air blocks underwater it has

664
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:17,870
do we get air blocks underwater it has
 

665
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,630
do we get air blocks underwater it has
to be pure air blocks that's that's

666
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:19,640
to be pure air blocks that's that's
 

667
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,060
to be pure air blocks that's that's
gonna be the challenge here so now it

668
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,070
gonna be the challenge here so now it
 

669
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,199
gonna be the challenge here so now it
would probably be a good time to talk

670
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:23,209
would probably be a good time to talk
 

671
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,510
would probably be a good time to talk
about our base design strategy as well

672
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:25,520
about our base design strategy as well
 

673
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,460
about our base design strategy as well
like how we're gonna grow and expand our

674
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,470
like how we're gonna grow and expand our
 

675
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,310
like how we're gonna grow and expand our
base I think we're gonna do kind of like

676
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
base I think we're gonna do kind of like
 

677
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,579
base I think we're gonna do kind of like
we did with the man cave where we build

678
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:33,589
we did with the man cave where we build
 

679
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:36,160
we did with the man cave where we build
farms and redstone contraptions and then

680
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,170
farms and redstone contraptions and then
 

681
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,460
farms and redstone contraptions and then
later link all of them together and try

682
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,470
later link all of them together and try
 

683
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,310
later link all of them together and try
to make a nice looking base and we're

684
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
to make a nice looking base and we're
 

685
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,829
to make a nice looking base and we're
gonna make things pretty organic as well

686
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:44,839
gonna make things pretty organic as well
 

687
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,380
gonna make things pretty organic as well
like for example our enchanting room

688
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,390
like for example our enchanting room
 

689
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,850
like for example our enchanting room
here I'm not gonna put it in line with

690
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:48,860
here I'm not gonna put it in line with
 

691
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,639
here I'm not gonna put it in line with
our mob farm like it's not gonna be

692
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:51,649
our mob farm like it's not gonna be
 

693
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:52,990
our mob farm like it's not gonna be
straight across from this it's gonna be

694
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,000
straight across from this it's gonna be
 

695
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,720
straight across from this it's gonna be
offset a little bit even though we want

696
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:55,730
offset a little bit even though we want
 

697
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,690
offset a little bit even though we want
this close to this we don't we don't

698
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:58,700
this close to this we don't we don't
 

699
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,480
this close to this we don't we don't
want it perfectly symmetrical right so

700
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,490
want it perfectly symmetrical right so
 

701
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,620
want it perfectly symmetrical right so
that's gonna be a big part of our base

702
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:02,630
that's gonna be a big part of our base
 

703
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,100
that's gonna be a big part of our base
design strategy as well so what we're

704
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,110
design strategy as well so what we're
 

705
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,540
design strategy as well so what we're
gonna do with this enchanting room I

706
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:07,550
gonna do with this enchanting room I
 

707
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,170
gonna do with this enchanting room I
think is kind of similar idea or similar

708
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,180
think is kind of similar idea or similar
 

709
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,830
think is kind of similar idea or similar
trick we used for that underwater

710
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:12,840
trick we used for that underwater
 

711
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,560
trick we used for that underwater
tree farm and if you don't remember what

712
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,570
tree farm and if you don't remember what
 

713
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,540
tree farm and if you don't remember what
we did with that good good it's gonna be

714
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:17,550
we did with that good good it's gonna be
 

715
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,710
we did with that good good it's gonna be
a surprise for you

716
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720

 

717
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,060

basically we're gonna use pistons to

718
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,070
basically we're gonna use pistons to
 

719
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,220
basically we're gonna use pistons to
remove the water temporarily because it

720
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,230
remove the water temporarily because it
 

721
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,040
remove the water temporarily because it
takes a split second for the water to

722
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,050
takes a split second for the water to
 

723
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,080
takes a split second for the water to
return after you retract the piston and

724
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,090
return after you retract the piston and
 

725
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,900
return after you retract the piston and
we're gonna use that to upgrade the

726
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:35,910
we're gonna use that to upgrade the
 

727
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,300
we're gonna use that to upgrade the
enchanting table for a brief moment

728
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,310

 

729
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,720

let's see here so I think that's all the

730
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,730
let's see here so I think that's all the
 

731
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,130
let's see here so I think that's all the
pistons we need right wait we gotta move

732
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,140
pistons we need right wait we gotta move
 

733
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,530
pistons we need right wait we gotta move
do we have to move these ones no because

734
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:51,540
do we have to move these ones no because
 

735
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,980
do we have to move these ones no because
this will come forward yeah that's right

736
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:54,990
this will come forward yeah that's right
 

737
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,750
this will come forward yeah that's right
that's that's fine I think we got it

738
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:56,760
that's that's fine I think we got it
 

739
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,370
that's that's fine I think we got it
right now right yeah okay mumbling to

740
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,380
right now right yeah okay mumbling to
 

741
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,200
right now right yeah okay mumbling to
myself anyways let's get back to this so

742
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,210
myself anyways let's get back to this so
 

743
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,380
myself anyways let's get back to this so
what we're gonna do to power these

744
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,390
what we're gonna do to power these
 

745
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,040
what we're gonna do to power these
Pistons

746
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,050
Pistons
 

747
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,570
Pistons
I think observers are gonna be our best

748
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:08,580
I think observers are gonna be our best
 

749
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,280
I think observers are gonna be our best
friend for this this whole build I think

750
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,290
friend for this this whole build I think
 

751
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,670
friend for this this whole build I think
we can power this just by yea like this

752
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:16,680
we can power this just by yea like this
 

753
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,210
we can power this just by yea like this
right so we update this yeah that

754
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,220
right so we update this yeah that
 

755
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,740
right so we update this yeah that
triggered both Pistons good yeah okay

756
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:27,750
triggered both Pistons good yeah okay
 

757
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,280
triggered both Pistons good yeah okay
and it's kind of like a t flip-flop so

758
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,290
and it's kind of like a t flip-flop so
 

759
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,640
and it's kind of like a t flip-flop so
then for the rest of these same deal

760
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:34,650
then for the rest of these same deal
 

761
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,170
then for the rest of these same deal
just vertically like this and put blocks

762
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,180
just vertically like this and put blocks
 

763
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,920
just vertically like this and put blocks
above one more over here cool so now

764
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:42,930
above one more over here cool so now
 

765
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,630
above one more over here cool so now
we've got to run like some redstone or

766
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
we've got to run like some redstone or
 

767
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,430
we've got to run like some redstone or
something under here to update all five

768
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,440
something under here to update all five
 

769
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,600
something under here to update all five
of these in in unison right oh yeah and

770
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:50,610
of these in in unison right oh yeah and
 

771
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,650
of these in in unison right oh yeah and
there's something I thought I'd point

772
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:51,660
there's something I thought I'd point
 

773
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,720
there's something I thought I'd point
out here so we did a trick earlier for

774
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:53,730
out here so we did a trick earlier for
 

775
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,250
out here so we did a trick earlier for
like vertical redstone through water

776
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,260
like vertical redstone through water
 

777
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,410
like vertical redstone through water
yeah using the bubble streams but

778
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:57,420
yeah using the bubble streams but
 

779
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,450
yeah using the bubble streams but
there's also like a horizontal trick as

780
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,460
there's also like a horizontal trick as
 

781
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,110
there's also like a horizontal trick as
well using leaves now a lot of you guys

782
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
well using leaves now a lot of you guys
 

783
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,820
well using leaves now a lot of you guys
have wanted me to use this we probably

784
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:04,830
have wanted me to use this we probably
 

785
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,050
have wanted me to use this we probably
actually will use this trick in the

786
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,060
actually will use this trick in the
 

787
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,170
actually will use this trick in the
space a fair bit not in this case though

788
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:09,180
space a fair bit not in this case though
 

789
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,380
space a fair bit not in this case though
I kind of want to explain why so if you

790
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,390
I kind of want to explain why so if you
 

791
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,360
I kind of want to explain why so if you
don't know if you place like a log next

792
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,370
don't know if you place like a log next
 

793
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,390
don't know if you place like a log next
to leaf box it actually causes them to

794
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,400
to leaf box it actually causes them to
 

795
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,700
to leaf box it actually causes them to
update because then the leaf blocks need

796
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:19,710
update because then the leaf blocks need
 

797
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,560
update because then the leaf blocks need
to know how far they are away from wood

798
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:21,570
to know how far they are away from wood
 

799
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,210
to know how far they are away from wood
to figure out if they should decay or

800
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,220
to figure out if they should decay or
 

801
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,570
to figure out if they should decay or
not

802
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:25,580

 

803
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,400

so you can use observers to detect that

804
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,410
so you can use observers to detect that
 

805
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,710
so you can use observers to detect that
and trigger stuff from a distance right

806
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
and trigger stuff from a distance right
 

807
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,810
and trigger stuff from a distance right
and the nice thing is these are these

808
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:32,820
and the nice thing is these are these
 

809
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,210
and the nice thing is these are these
work underwater right if this was

810
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,220
work underwater right if this was
 

811
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,590
work underwater right if this was
redstone we'd have to surround it with

812
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:36,600
redstone we'd have to surround it with
 

813
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,860
redstone we'd have to surround it with
blocks to keep it from washing away

814
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:38,870
blocks to keep it from washing away
 

815
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,390
blocks to keep it from washing away
while this just takes up a single block

816
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,400
while this just takes up a single block
 

817
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,090
while this just takes up a single block
so that's really nice actually a couple

818
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,100
so that's really nice actually a couple
 

819
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,680
so that's really nice actually a couple
things about this though like we can

820
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:45,690
things about this though like we can
 

821
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,690
things about this though like we can
chain them together over long distances

822
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:47,700
chain them together over long distances
 

823
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,590
chain them together over long distances
if we do little breaks like this oh I

824
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:54,600
if we do little breaks like this oh I
 

825
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,320
if we do little breaks like this oh I
thought I guess if there's two at the

826
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,330
thought I guess if there's two at the
 

827
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,640
thought I guess if there's two at the
same spot it doesn't trigger it right if

828
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:01,650
same spot it doesn't trigger it right if
 

829
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,650
same spot it doesn't trigger it right if
I'd never actually use this oh yeah now

830
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
I'd never actually use this oh yeah now
 

831
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,210
I'd never actually use this oh yeah now
it triggered that piston there at that

832
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,220
it triggered that piston there at that
 

833
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,200
it triggered that piston there at that
time okay so you will notice I set these

834
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,210
time okay so you will notice I set these
 

835
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,960
time okay so you will notice I set these
up so we can see there is a bit of a

836
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:14,970
up so we can see there is a bit of a
 

837
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,940
up so we can see there is a bit of a
delayed this so if we place the snare

838
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:18,950
delayed this so if we place the snare
 

839
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,410
delayed this so if we place the snare
see that piston activates first and that

840
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:21,420
see that piston activates first and that
 

841
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,970
see that piston activates first and that
one then that one one tick apart from

842
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:22,980
one then that one one tick apart from
 

843
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,780
one then that one one tick apart from
each other so in the case here where

844
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:26,790
each other so in the case here where
 

845
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,280
each other so in the case here where
we're doing the enchanting table this is

846
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,290
we're doing the enchanting table this is
 

847
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,210
we're doing the enchanting table this is
not a good way of doing redstone because

848
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,220
not a good way of doing redstone because
 

849
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,440
not a good way of doing redstone because
that delay is gonna mess up the system

850
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,450
that delay is gonna mess up the system
 

851
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,210
that delay is gonna mess up the system
we need all the bookshelves to move at

852
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:38,220
we need all the bookshelves to move at
 

853
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,860
we need all the bookshelves to move at
the exact same time and like the further

854
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:42,870
the exact same time and like the further
 

855
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,330
the exact same time and like the further
the redstone travels the longer the

856
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,340
the redstone travels the longer the
 

857
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,680
the redstone travels the longer the
delay is gonna be so that doesn't really

858
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:45,690
delay is gonna be so that doesn't really
 

859
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,940
delay is gonna be so that doesn't really
work in this case so we're gonna use

860
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:46,950
work in this case so we're gonna use
 

861
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,820
work in this case so we're gonna use
actual redstone here so this gate seems

862
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:49,830
actual redstone here so this gate seems
 

863
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,590
actual redstone here so this gate seems
to work pretty good actually what we do

864
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
to work pretty good actually what we do
 

865
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,680
to work pretty good actually what we do
we flip this trapdoor up we flip it down

866
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,690
we flip this trapdoor up we flip it down
 

867
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,470
we flip this trapdoor up we flip it down
so it squishes us down right and then if

868
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:57,480
so it squishes us down right and then if
 

869
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
so it squishes us down right and then if
we close this one I think water can't

870
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,490
we close this one I think water can't
 

871
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,080
we close this one I think water can't
get in and we're free to do our redstone

872
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,090
get in and we're free to do our redstone
 

873
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,970
get in and we're free to do our redstone
and then we just have to exit really

874
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:07,980
and then we just have to exit really
 

875
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,500
and then we just have to exit really
quickly so it doesn't wash away that

876
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:12,510
quickly so it doesn't wash away that
 

877
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,430
quickly so it doesn't wash away that
work we lost one there but we don't

878
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
work we lost one there but we don't
 

879
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,650
work we lost one there but we don't
actually need redstone in that spot yeah

880
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,660
actually need redstone in that spot yeah
 

881
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,450
actually need redstone in that spot yeah
because it goes under this observer

882
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,460
because it goes under this observer
 

883
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,390
because it goes under this observer
there aha so again I think we'll just

884
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
there aha so again I think we'll just
 

885
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,490
there aha so again I think we'll just
use a note block to trigger this so when

886
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
use a note block to trigger this so when
 

887
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,510
use a note block to trigger this so when
we right-click this we want the

888
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:28,520
we right-click this we want the
 

889
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,150
we right-click this we want the
bookshelves to move I think an easy way

890
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,160
bookshelves to move I think an easy way
 

891
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,420
bookshelves to move I think an easy way
of connecting to that redstone is just

892
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:35,430
of connecting to that redstone is just
 

893
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,390
of connecting to that redstone is just
to do this

894
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
to do this
 

895
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,660
to do this
Oh misplaced the problem is I think we

896
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:42,670
Oh misplaced the problem is I think we
 

897
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,980
Oh misplaced the problem is I think we
might need to have a little bit of a

898
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:43,990
might need to have a little bit of a
 

899
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,450
might need to have a little bit of a
delay to this otherwise it's gonna be

900
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:45,460
delay to this otherwise it's gonna be
 

901
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,780
delay to this otherwise it's gonna be
it's gonna activate too quickly all

902
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:51,790
it's gonna activate too quickly all
 

903
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,510
it's gonna activate too quickly all
right and it's in Reverse oh why those

904
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:54,520
right and it's in Reverse oh why those
 

905
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,200
right and it's in Reverse oh why those
come out of the sink okay so these two

906
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,210
come out of the sink okay so these two
 

907
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,730
come out of the sink okay so these two
bookshelves here kept going outta sync

908
00:20:59,730 --> 00:20:59,740
bookshelves here kept going outta sync
 

909
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,650
bookshelves here kept going outta sync
with each other so I had to extend the

910
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:01,660
with each other so I had to extend the
 

911
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,360
with each other so I had to extend the
redstone one more block it goes

912
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,370
redstone one more block it goes
 

913
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,030
redstone one more block it goes
underneath this piston now and that

914
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,040
underneath this piston now and that
 

915
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,010
underneath this piston now and that
seems to update it properly so check

916
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,020
seems to update it properly so check
 

917
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,970
seems to update it properly so check
this out I did they all go together they

918
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:11,980
this out I did they all go together they
 

919
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
this out I did they all go together they
all come back this is water over here

920
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:13,990
all come back this is water over here
 

921
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,760
all come back this is water over here
again all right that's not air we go to

922
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:17,770
again all right that's not air we go to
 

923
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,020
again all right that's not air we go to
enchant something it only goes up to

924
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,030
enchant something it only goes up to
 

925
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,430
enchant something it only goes up to
level five because it's surrounded by

926
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,440
level five because it's surrounded by
 

927
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,190
level five because it's surrounded by
water but if we retract this and put the

928
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,200
water but if we retract this and put the
 

929
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,630
water but if we retract this and put the
book in at just the right time

930
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:27,640
book in at just the right time
 

931
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,340
book in at just the right time
you see it's level five still messed it

932
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,350
you see it's level five still messed it
 

933
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:36,450
you see it's level five still messed it
up there we go we got level thirty so it

934
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,460
up there we go we got level thirty so it
 

935
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,720
up there we go we got level thirty so it
matters when the book goes in the book

936
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:39,730
matters when the book goes in the book
 

937
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,000
matters when the book goes in the book
has to go in once once those air spaces

938
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,010
has to go in once once those air spaces
 

939
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,760
has to go in once once those air spaces
are there so there's like a fraction of

940
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,770
are there so there's like a fraction of
 

941
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,760
are there so there's like a fraction of
a window to get it right now actually

942
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:47,770
a window to get it right now actually
 

943
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,960
a window to get it right now actually
not as hard as to do as I thought though

944
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:50,970
not as hard as to do as I thought though
 

945
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,120
not as hard as to do as I thought though
got it again I think it'll be a little

946
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,130
got it again I think it'll be a little
 

947
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,160
got it again I think it'll be a little
bit easier if I set this up so that it's

948
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,170
bit easier if I set this up so that it's
 

949
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,890
bit easier if I set this up so that it's
like we have to click this twice I only

950
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:01,900
like we have to click this twice I only
 

951
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,460
like we have to click this twice I only
want to click it once so I think we got

952
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,470
want to click it once so I think we got
 

953
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,000
want to click it once so I think we got
to put some repeaters in this as well a

954
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,010
to put some repeaters in this as well a
 

955
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,490
to put some repeaters in this as well a
whole snappers I think we got it now I

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:11,500
whole snappers I think we got it now I
 

957
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,120
whole snappers I think we got it now I
just put a repeater at the end here set

958
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,130
just put a repeater at the end here set
 

959
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,130
just put a repeater at the end here set
it to four I found out I didn't use

960
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,140
it to four I found out I didn't use
 

961
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,960
it to four I found out I didn't use
daylight sensors as a block that doesn't

962
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:18,970
daylight sensors as a block that doesn't
 

963
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,730
daylight sensors as a block that doesn't
get waterlogged so I'm free to like

964
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:20,740
get waterlogged so I'm free to like
 

965
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,240
get waterlogged so I'm free to like
adjust the repeater here it's kind of a

966
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,250
adjust the repeater here it's kind of a
 

967
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,770
adjust the repeater here it's kind of a
building a ship in a bottle you know

968
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:25,780
building a ship in a bottle you know
 

969
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,630
building a ship in a bottle you know
like you have to control the Redstone

970
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:27,640
like you have to control the Redstone
 

971
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,000
like you have to control the Redstone
and then seal it up afterwards without

972
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,010
and then seal it up afterwards without
 

973
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,560
and then seal it up afterwards without
it getting washed away do that yes okay

974
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:34,570
it getting washed away do that yes okay
 

975
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,360
it getting washed away do that yes okay
we saved it amazing all right so check

976
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,370
we saved it amazing all right so check
 

977
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,320
we saved it amazing all right so check
this out

978
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,330
this out
 

979
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,350
this out
we click it goes out and then back so

980
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
we click it goes out and then back so
 

981
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,600
we click it goes out and then back so
it's only one click now instead of two

982
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:45,610
it's only one click now instead of two
 

983
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,780
it's only one click now instead of two
and it's a lot easier to time this

984
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:48,790
and it's a lot easier to time this
 

985
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,590
and it's a lot easier to time this
because we have

986
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
because we have
 

987
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,140
because we have
we have more time to do it we got 30

988
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,150
we have more time to do it we got 30
 

989
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,750
we have more time to do it we got 30
there try it again

990
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
there try it again
 

991
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,520
there try it again
30 again that time we got 16 so if you

992
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,530
30 again that time we got 16 so if you
 

993
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,410
30 again that time we got 16 so if you
do it at the wrong time sometimes it's

994
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:01,420
do it at the wrong time sometimes it's
 

995
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,450
do it at the wrong time sometimes it's
like harshly flooded and you can get

996
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,460
like harshly flooded and you can get
 

997
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,000
like harshly flooded and you can get
like a lower enchantment so we actually

998
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,010
like a lower enchantment so we actually
 

999
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,970
like a lower enchantment so we actually
have three ranges have been chanting

1000
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:08,980
have three ranges have been chanting
 

1001
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,590
have three ranges have been chanting
here with this too so we can go for a

1002
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:10,600
here with this too so we can go for a
 

1003
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,920
here with this too so we can go for a
level five a level 16 or 30 depending on

1004
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:13,930
level five a level 16 or 30 depending on
 

1005
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:21,240
level five a level 16 or 30 depending on
when we put the book in 30 with practice

1006
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,250
when we put the book in 30 with practice
 

1007
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,660
when we put the book in 30 with practice
it will get easier to use I hope it's

1008
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:24,670
it will get easier to use I hope it's
 

1009
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,090
it will get easier to use I hope it's
not too bad though it's not too bad all

1010
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,100
not too bad though it's not too bad all
 

1011
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,860
not too bad though it's not too bad all
right so now we want to decorate this

1012
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:28,870
right so now we want to decorate this
 

1013
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,720
right so now we want to decorate this
little bit and I think we're good to go

1014
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:30,730
little bit and I think we're good to go
 

1015
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,390
little bit and I think we're good to go
here now the question comes up what are

1016
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,400
here now the question comes up what are
 

1017
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,490
here now the question comes up what are
we gonna actually build out of well I

1018
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:35,500
we gonna actually build out of well I
 

1019
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,030
we gonna actually build out of well I
did this if we look over here though the

1020
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,040
did this if we look over here though the
 

1021
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,800
did this if we look over here though the
building styles a little bit difference

1022
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:40,810
building styles a little bit difference
 

1023
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,440
building styles a little bit difference
I think we're gonna change it up quite a

1024
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,450
I think we're gonna change it up quite a
 

1025
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,150
I think we're gonna change it up quite a
bit in different parts of the base like

1026
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,160
bit in different parts of the base like
 

1027
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,330
bit in different parts of the base like
over here we have no terracotta we use

1028
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,340
over here we have no terracotta we use
 

1029
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,850
over here we have no terracotta we use
strip logs few different types we use

1030
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:50,860
strip logs few different types we use
 

1031
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,920
strip logs few different types we use
the dark prison marine regular

1032
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:52,930
the dark prison marine regular
 

1033
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,860
the dark prison marine regular
prismarine lots of it and then we just

1034
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:55,870
prismarine lots of it and then we just
 

1035
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,450
prismarine lots of it and then we just
spam it with coral and sea grass and

1036
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:57,460
spam it with coral and sea grass and
 

1037
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,280
spam it with coral and sea grass and
kelp and stuff afterwards and it looks

1038
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,290
kelp and stuff afterwards and it looks
 

1039
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,310
kelp and stuff afterwards and it looks
pretty good right it's not bad color and

1040
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
pretty good right it's not bad color and
 

1041
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,620
pretty good right it's not bad color and
stuff I think on the inside of our base

1042
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,630
stuff I think on the inside of our base
 

1043
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,730
stuff I think on the inside of our base
though we're gonna use a lot of

1044
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:05,740
though we're gonna use a lot of
 

1045
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,000
though we're gonna use a lot of
terracotta for our walls mainly and

1046
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,010
terracotta for our walls mainly and
 

1047
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,890
terracotta for our walls mainly and
different colors too like over there we

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:10,900
different colors too like over there we
 

1049
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,140
different colors too like over there we
got red here we got grey probably use

1050
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,150
got red here we got grey probably use
 

1051
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,560
got red here we got grey probably use
oranges and maybe even blues and stuff I

1052
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,570
oranges and maybe even blues and stuff I
 

1053
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,470
oranges and maybe even blues and stuff I
don't know it's gonna change a lot so it

1054
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
don't know it's gonna change a lot so it
 

1055
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,530
don't know it's gonna change a lot so it
it'll feel different in different areas

1056
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:22,540
it'll feel different in different areas
 

1057
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,470
it'll feel different in different areas

1062
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:29,650
floor like it really stands out it's
 

1063
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,190
floor like it really stands out it's
nice and bright and we got a mix in some

1064

1067
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,730
prism reen and bogs and stuff throughout
as well and that's kind of the general

1068
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:35,740
as well and that's kind of the general
 

1069
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,420
as well and that's kind of the general

lanterns a lot for lighting and we gotta
get some dark prizren in here let's see

1074
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:48,760
get some dark prizren in here let's see
 

1075
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
get some dark prizren in here let's see
here

1076
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,050
here
 

1077
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:57,600
here
a few stairs get a few slabs and I guess

1078
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:57,610
a few stairs get a few slabs and I guess
 

1079
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,310
a few stairs get a few slabs and I guess
we can probably put it underneath this

1080
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,320
we can probably put it underneath this
 

1081
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,470
we can probably put it underneath this
somewhere yeah let's put it over here

1082
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
somewhere yeah let's put it over here
 

1083
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,390
somewhere yeah let's put it over here
and over there let's let's break this

1084
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:11,400

 

1085
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:19,080

maybe how's that look cool cool alright

1086
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,090
maybe how's that look cool cool alright
 

1087
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,150
maybe how's that look cool cool alright
I kind of want this to stick out more

1088
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,160
I kind of want this to stick out more
 

1089
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,580
I kind of want this to stick out more
maybe it's looking a little plain maybe

1090
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:23,590
maybe it's looking a little plain maybe
 

1091
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:29,730
maybe it's looking a little plain maybe
we'll just do one of these I think on

1092
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:29,740
we'll just do one of these I think on
 

1093
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,860
we'll just do one of these I think on
the floor we will mix in some oak planks

1094
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:31,870
the floor we will mix in some oak planks
 

1095
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,450
the floor we will mix in some oak planks
as well just to break it up a bit so

1096
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:33,460
as well just to break it up a bit so
 

1097
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,690
as well just to break it up a bit so

1101
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:44,070
have any candy go away
let's go down one more with that I

1102
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
let's go down one more with that I
 

1103
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
let's go down one more with that I
wanted to get an enderchest in here as

1104
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:45,850
wanted to get an enderchest in here as
 

1105
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,100
wanted to get an enderchest in here as
well maybe we'll put that over here and

1106
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,110
well maybe we'll put that over here and
 

1107
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,680
well maybe we'll put that over here and

first little module to our underwater
base and as we build more modules we'll

1154
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,250
base and as we build more modules we'll
 

1155
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,860
base and as we build more modules we'll
connect them together with hallways and

1156
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:01,870
connect them together with hallways and
 

1157
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,869

stuff this is supposed to be that
inside of our base like it will be

1160
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:05,799
inside of our base like it will be
