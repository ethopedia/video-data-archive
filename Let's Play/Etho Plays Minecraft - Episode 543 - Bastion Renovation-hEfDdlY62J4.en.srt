houses and some kind of town sort of

320
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,100
houses and some kind of town sort of
 

321
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,409
houses and some kind of town sort of
thing and instead of filling it with

322
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
thing and instead of filling it with
 

323
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,820
thing and instead of filling it with
villagers I want to fill it with big

324
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:13,830
villagers I want to fill it with big
 

325
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,760
villagers I want to fill it with big
ones though I like that idea

326
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:15,770
ones though I like that idea
 

327
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,170
ones though I like that idea
you guys suggested down here I should

328
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,180
you guys suggested down here I should
 

329
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,810
you guys suggested down here I should
put like a Strider stable I love that

330
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:20,820
put like a Strider stable I love that
 

331
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,700
put like a Strider stable I love that
idea cuz it's like down at the lava and

332
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:22,710
idea cuz it's like down at the lava and
 

333
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,350
idea cuz it's like down at the lava and
we can maybe pass underneath the bridge

334
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,360
we can maybe pass underneath the bridge
 

335
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,379
we can maybe pass underneath the bridge
Oh

336
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:26,389
Oh
 

337
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,089
Oh
oh yeah probably not doing that to that

338
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:28,099
oh yeah probably not doing that to that
 

339
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,189
oh yeah probably not doing that to that
today either though we're gonna be

340
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,199
today either though we're gonna be
 

341
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,869
today either though we're gonna be
working on the inside mostly but I did

342
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:31,879
working on the inside mostly but I did
 

343
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,580
working on the inside mostly but I did
want to do one thing you guys suggested

344
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:33,590
want to do one thing you guys suggested
 

345
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,619
want to do one thing you guys suggested
with the bridge you guys seem to like

346
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:35,629
with the bridge you guys seem to like
 

347
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,749
with the bridge you guys seem to like
the bridge except for the bottom here

348
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
the bridge except for the bottom here
 

349
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,159
the bridge except for the bottom here
you said I should walk it up a little

350
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,169
you said I should walk it up a little
 

351
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,140
you said I should walk it up a little
bit and I agree I think we're gonna

352
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,150
bit and I agree I think we're gonna
 

353
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,649
bit and I agree I think we're gonna
replace the basalt with some crimson

354
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:44,659
replace the basalt with some crimson
 

355
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,170
replace the basalt with some crimson
wood this shouldn't burn from the lava

356
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,180
wood this shouldn't burn from the lava
 

357
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,689
wood this shouldn't burn from the lava
right pretty sure then I think we will

358
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:52,699
right pretty sure then I think we will
 

359
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,429
right pretty sure then I think we will
put some walls down this is really hard

360
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:54,439
put some walls down this is really hard
 

361
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,219
put some walls down this is really hard
to build the lava I think we're gonna

362
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:57,229
to build the lava I think we're gonna
 

363
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,640
to build the lava I think we're gonna
have some walls to bulk it up a bit and

364
00:06:59,640 --> 00:06:59,650
have some walls to bulk it up a bit and
 

365
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,279
have some walls to bulk it up a bit and
then below and on top of that we'll put

366
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,289
then below and on top of that we'll put
 

367
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,700
then below and on top of that we'll put
the salts now this is like actually

368
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:06,710
the salts now this is like actually
 

369
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,619
the salts now this is like actually
impossible Wow

370
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:08,629
impossible Wow
 

371
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,760
impossible Wow
I thought I was gonna just build this

372
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,770
I thought I was gonna just build this
 

373
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,360
I thought I was gonna just build this
real quick on camera and I can barely

374
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,370
real quick on camera and I can barely
 

375
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,550
real quick on camera and I can barely
move in this thing or see this is

376
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:15,560
move in this thing or see this is
 

377
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,249
move in this thing or see this is
wonderful but yeah kind of like we did

378
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:18,259
wonderful but yeah kind of like we did
 

379
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,839
wonderful but yeah kind of like we did
at our doors same exact sort of style we

380
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:22,849
at our doors same exact sort of style we
 

381
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,369
at our doors same exact sort of style we
put that on top and then more walls

382
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:24,379
put that on top and then more walls
 

383
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,559
put that on top and then more walls
running up and then we'll probably put

384
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:26,569
running up and then we'll probably put
 

385
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,959
running up and then we'll probably put
another piece of this basalts like up

386
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:28,969
another piece of this basalts like up
 

387
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:29,589
another piece of this basalts like up
over there

388
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
over there
 

389
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:37,920
over there
and I think that should look pretty cool

390
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:37,930

 

391
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,570

okay well we definitely bucked up the

392
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:40,580
okay well we definitely bucked up the
 

393
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,100
okay well we definitely bucked up the
lakes quite a bit here maybe a little

394
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,110
lakes quite a bit here maybe a little
 

395
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,969
lakes quite a bit here maybe a little
too bulky now but I think I might leave

396
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:45,979
too bulky now but I think I might leave
 

397
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,350
too bulky now but I think I might leave
it like that I'm not sure I think

398
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
it like that I'm not sure I think
 

399
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,149
it like that I'm not sure I think
ideally what I would like to do is space

400
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:49,159
ideally what I would like to do is space
 

401
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,579
ideally what I would like to do is space
these another 2 or 4 blocks apart from

402
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:51,589
these another 2 or 4 blocks apart from
 

403
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,950
these another 2 or 4 blocks apart from
each other like additional to what we

404
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:53,960
each other like additional to what we
 

405
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,990
each other like additional to what we
have right now and then keep the same

406
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
have right now and then keep the same
 

407
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,050
have right now and then keep the same
legs but I don't really want to rebuild

408
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,060
legs but I don't really want to rebuild
 

409
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,689
legs but I don't really want to rebuild
the bridge so we might just leave it

410
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:01,699
the bridge so we might just leave it
 

411
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,999
the bridge so we might just leave it
like this I'm not sure anyways I think

412
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,009
like this I'm not sure anyways I think
 

413
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,469
like this I'm not sure anyways I think
it's about time we head inside the

414
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:05,479
it's about time we head inside the
 

415
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,379
it's about time we head inside the
crimson key so our goal is to renovate

416
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:08,389
crimson key so our goal is to renovate
 

417
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,079
crimson key so our goal is to renovate
this place and like try bring it back to

418
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,089
this place and like try bring it back to
 

419
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,670
this place and like try bring it back to
its original state right so we don't

420
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:12,680
its original state right so we don't
 

421
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,439
its original state right so we don't
actually want to change too much of the

422
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:14,449
actually want to change too much of the
 

423
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,679
actually want to change too much of the
design if possible just where we

424
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:17,689
design if possible just where we
 

425
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,200
design if possible just where we
absolutely need to or if anything looks

426
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,210
absolutely need to or if anything looks
 

427
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,339
absolutely need to or if anything looks
really out of place

428
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:21,349
really out of place
 

429
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,200
really out of place
so I noticed there's a room over here

430
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,210
so I noticed there's a room over here
 

431
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,719
so I noticed there's a room over here
like a sort of a cage structure sort of

432
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:25,729
like a sort of a cage structure sort of
 

433
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,760
like a sort of a cage structure sort of
thing with some fire on top of

434
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:27,770
thing with some fire on top of
 

435
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,579
thing with some fire on top of
netherrack and then there's a hole up

436
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:30,589
netherrack and then there's a hole up
 

437
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,350
netherrack and then there's a hole up
there and a pig 'ln or two trying to

438
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
there and a pig 'ln or two trying to
 

439
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,449
there and a pig 'ln or two trying to
kill me it's very dangerous in here

440
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:37,459
kill me it's very dangerous in here
 

441
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,700
kill me it's very dangerous in here
right I don't really want a weird cold

442
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:39,710
right I don't really want a weird cold
 

443
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,710
right I don't really want a weird cold
I think I'm gonna stick with the diamond

444
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:41,720
I think I'm gonna stick with the diamond
 

445
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,900
I think I'm gonna stick with the diamond
stuff while I'm working around here so

446
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:43,910
stuff while I'm working around here so
 

447
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,030
stuff while I'm working around here so
what I thought would be cool is maybe we

448
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,040
what I thought would be cool is maybe we
 

449
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,960
what I thought would be cool is maybe we
turn this into our beacon right we got

450
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:49,970
turn this into our beacon right we got
 

451
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,580
turn this into our beacon right we got
the two by two with the fire

452
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,590
the two by two with the fire
 

453
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,300
the two by two with the fire
maybe we upgrade that right or the fires

454
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,310
maybe we upgrade that right or the fires
 

455
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,640
maybe we upgrade that right or the fires
let's let's make that our beacon blocks

456
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:57,650
let's let's make that our beacon blocks
 

457
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,890
let's let's make that our beacon blocks
maybe we'll do a two by two and I'll

458
00:08:59,890 --> 00:08:59,900
maybe we'll do a two by two and I'll
 

459
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,020
maybe we'll do a two by two and I'll
build the probably an iron pyramid for

460
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,030
build the probably an iron pyramid for
 

461
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,430
build the probably an iron pyramid for
right now and later we might change that

462
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
right now and later we might change that
 

463
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,210
right now and later we might change that
to gold we got the beacon pyramid built

464
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,220
to gold we got the beacon pyramid built
 

465
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,830
to gold we got the beacon pyramid built
here but it's not working the beacons

466
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:08,840
here but it's not working the beacons
 

467
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,570
here but it's not working the beacons
aren't shining I think because we got

468
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:10,580
aren't shining I think because we got
 

469
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,380
aren't shining I think because we got
some black stone above here I might just

470
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,390
some black stone above here I might just
 

471
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,320
some black stone above here I might just
need to replace them again for them to

472
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,330
need to replace them again for them to
 

473
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,020
need to replace them again for them to
figure it out let's see if that does the

474
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,030
figure it out let's see if that does the
 

475
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,730
figure it out let's see if that does the
trick huh huh no might be the

476
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:27,740
trick huh huh no might be the
 

477
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,920
trick huh huh no might be the
netherworld blocks here stopping it

478
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:31,930

 

479
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,320

maybe no is the nether right I thought

480
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,330
maybe no is the nether right I thought
 

481
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,820
maybe no is the nether right I thought
it could shine through netherrack or did

482
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:39,830
it could shine through netherrack or did
 

483
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,800
it could shine through netherrack or did
I get that wrong

484
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:41,810
I get that wrong
 

485
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,330
I get that wrong
I never build beacons down below I

486
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,340
I never build beacons down below I
 

487
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,380
I never build beacons down below I
always put them on the roof I thought

488
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,390
always put them on the roof I thought
 

489
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,240
always put them on the roof I thought
they made it so he could shine through

490
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,250
they made it so he could shine through
 

491
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,900
they made it so he could shine through
netherrack though I guess not

492
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:48,910
netherrack though I guess not
 

493
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,070
netherrack though I guess not
we're gonna go for the full deal here

494
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,080
we're gonna go for the full deal here
 

495
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,930
we're gonna go for the full deal here
hey Stu we want resistance for sure

496
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:55,940
hey Stu we want resistance for sure
 

497
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,770
hey Stu we want resistance for sure
resistance to do we want speed to we'll

498
00:09:59,770 --> 00:09:59,780
resistance to do we want speed to we'll
 

499
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,930
resistance to do we want speed to we'll
try it out and then finally we'll go for

500
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:01,940
try it out and then finally we'll go for
 

501
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,320
try it out and then finally we'll go for
strength and region and with that it

502
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,330
strength and region and with that it
 

503
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,940
strength and region and with that it
should be much easier to work around

504
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:06,950
should be much easier to work around
 

505
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,130
should be much easier to work around
here now unfortunately that beacon based

506
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,140
here now unfortunately that beacon based
 

507
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,540
here now unfortunately that beacon based
does stick out quite a ways so we'll

508
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,550
does stick out quite a ways so we'll
 

509
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,950
does stick out quite a ways so we'll
probably want to wrap the black stone

510
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:11,960
probably want to wrap the black stone
 

511
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,860
probably want to wrap the black stone
around and underneath it but let's try

512
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:14,870
around and underneath it but let's try
 

513
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,240
around and underneath it but let's try
figure out how we're actually building

514
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,250
figure out how we're actually building
 

515
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,580
figure out how we're actually building
here before we do something like that so

516
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:18,590
here before we do something like that so
 

517
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,220
here before we do something like that so
looking around block pellet what do we

518
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,230
looking around block pellet what do we
 

519
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,050
looking around block pellet what do we
see we see a lot of black stone and a

520
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,060
see we see a lot of black stone and a
 

521
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,420
see we see a lot of black stone and a
lot of the salt and that's about it we

522
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,430
lot of the salt and that's about it we
 

523
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,310
lot of the salt and that's about it we
have some orange with the lava in

524
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,320
have some orange with the lava in
 

525
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,050
have some orange with the lava in
general though these structures have

526
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,060
general though these structures have
 

527
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,210
general though these structures have
nothing for the eyes to focus on they're

528
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:31,220
nothing for the eyes to focus on they're
 

529
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,870

very bleak it's black stone floor walls

530
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
very bleak it's black stone floor walls
 

531
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,090
very bleak it's black stone floor walls
and ceiling pretty much with the salt

532
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,100
and ceiling pretty much with the salt
 

533
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,910
and ceiling pretty much with the salt
mixed in randomly so I think the biggest

534
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
mixed in randomly so I think the biggest
 

535
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,590
mixed in randomly so I think the biggest
improvement we can make to this place

536
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
improvement we can make to this place
 

537
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,510
improvement we can make to this place
right off the bat is to put in different

538
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:43,520
right off the bat is to put in different
 

539
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,030
right off the bat is to put in different
materials for the floor so we're gonna

540
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,040
materials for the floor so we're gonna
 

541
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,210
materials for the floor so we're gonna
get rid of the basalt and black stone

542
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,220
get rid of the basalt and black stone
 

543
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,990
get rid of the basalt and black stone
floors here

544
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
floors here
 

545
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,090
floors here
and I've messed around with a few

546
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,100
and I've messed around with a few
 

547
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,260
and I've messed around with a few
different things here I found

548
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,270
different things here I found
 

549
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,170
different things here I found
really don't like brown mixed with

550
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,180
really don't like brown mixed with
 

551
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,360
really don't like brown mixed with
basalts and black stone too much

552
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,370
basalts and black stone too much
 

553
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,370
basalts and black stone too much
and since we're calling it their crimson

554
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,380
and since we're calling it their crimson
 

555
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,100
and since we're calling it their crimson
keep I thought let's try pick a red

556
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,110
keep I thought let's try pick a red
 

557
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,930
keep I thought let's try pick a red
block for the floor so I tried it a

558
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:04,940
block for the floor so I tried it a
 

559
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,120
block for the floor so I tried it a
couple different things here this looks

560
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,130
couple different things here this looks
 

561
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,910
couple different things here this looks
too clean to me

562
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
too clean to me
 

563
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,410
too clean to me
this looks okay but it's kind of dark

564
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:11,420
this looks okay but it's kind of dark
 

565
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,240
this looks okay but it's kind of dark
and it's got a bit of a purple tinge to

566
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
and it's got a bit of a purple tinge to
 

567
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,340
and it's got a bit of a purple tinge to
it so I actually think the best floor we

568
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,350
it so I actually think the best floor we
 

569
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,520
it so I actually think the best floor we
depict is the nigh Liam strange is that

570
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,530
depict is the nigh Liam strange is that
 

571
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,980
depict is the nigh Liam strange is that
it might be so we're gonna replace a lot

572
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:20,990
it might be so we're gonna replace a lot
 

573
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,860
it might be so we're gonna replace a lot
of the floor year with nigh Liam it kind

574
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:23,870
of the floor year with nigh Liam it kind
 

575
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,990
of the floor year with nigh Liam it kind
of gives like a royal carpet kind of

feel to the place I find we're gonna

578
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
feel to the place I find we're gonna
 

579
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,930
feel to the place I find we're gonna
have to do something about the spawner

580
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:28,940
have to do something about the spawner
 

581
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,520
have to do something about the spawner
very soon it's driving me crazy

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,480
to me we have the option of bone me
 

591
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
to me we have the option of bone me
owning a two if we want I'm not sure if

592
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,490
owning a two if we want I'm not sure if
 

593

we want to do that but it's an option Oh
 

595
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,910
we want to do that but it's an option Oh
actually another thing we could do with

596
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:48,920
actually another thing we could do with
 

597
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,590
actually another thing we could do with
this is just break up a couple pieces

598
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,600
this is just break up a couple pieces
 

599
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,150
this is just break up a couple pieces
every now and then and mix in some

600
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
every now and then and mix in some
 

601
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,490
every now and then and mix in some
crimson wood is to add a bit more

602
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,500
crimson wood is to add a bit more
 

603
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,020
crimson wood is to add a bit more
texture to it as well

604
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,030
texture to it as well
 

605
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,050
texture to it as well
and rather than firming the nily I'm all

606
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,060
and rather than firming the nily I'm all
 

607
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,210
and rather than firming the nily I'm all
we got to do is put down netherrack and

608
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,220
we got to do is put down netherrack and
 

609
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,900
we got to do is put down netherrack and
then bomyeo like to spread it oh I'm in

610
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:04,910
then bomyeo like to spread it oh I'm in
 

611
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,320

trouble I'm in trouble
 

613
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,730
trouble I'm in trouble
okay we're dealing with that spawner

614
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:12,740
okay we're dealing with that spawner
 

615
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,460
okay we're dealing with that spawner
that was almost a death right there we

616
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,470
that was almost a death right there we
 

617
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,870
that was almost a death right there we
don't actually want to break the spawner

618
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
don't actually want to break the spawner
 

619
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,310
don't actually want to break the spawner
though it's producing tons of these

620
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
though it's producing tons of these
 

621
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,660
though it's producing tons of these
magma slimes and that's free magma cream

622
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:21,670
magma slimes and that's free magma cream
 

623
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,100
magma slimes and that's free magma cream
2x2 magma cream I believe makes metal

624
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,110
2x2 magma cream I believe makes metal
 

625
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,220
2x2 magma cream I believe makes metal
blocks so yeah it's not a bad thing to

626
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,230
blocks so yeah it's not a bad thing to
 

627
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,520
blocks so yeah it's not a bad thing to
have running the way I see it we only

628
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,530
have running the way I see it we only
 

629
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,960
have running the way I see it we only
really have two options these guys are

630
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:31,970
really have two options these guys are
 

631
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,490
really have two options these guys are
actually really hard to kill cuz they

632
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,500
actually really hard to kill cuz they
 

633
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,550
actually really hard to kill cuz they
don't take ball damage and they don't

634
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
don't take ball damage and they don't
 

635
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,700
don't take ball damage and they don't
take fire damage so what do we do with

636
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:39,710
take fire damage so what do we do with
 

637
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,580
take fire damage so what do we do with
them right you can move them with lava

638
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,590
them right you can move them with lava
 

639
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,960
them right you can move them with lava
so that's one option

640
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:43,970
so that's one option
 

641
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,940
so that's one option
you can move them around and out of this

642
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:45,950
you can move them around and out of this
 

643
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,250
you can move them around and out of this
area I think I just want to pull them as

644
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,260
area I think I just want to pull them as
 

645
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,050
area I think I just want to pull them as
soon as possible so I'm gonna put down

646
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,060
soon as possible so I'm gonna put down
 

647
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,480
soon as possible so I'm gonna put down
some nily 'm and then I think we'll do

648
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,490
some nily 'm and then I think we'll do
 

649
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,690
some nily 'm and then I think we'll do
wither roses on top of this oh we can't

650
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:55,700
wither roses on top of this oh we can't
 

651
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,840
wither roses on top of this oh we can't
put where the Roses on this stuff really

652
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:58,850
put where the Roses on this stuff really
 

653
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,690
put where the Roses on this stuff really
okay change of plans

654
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:01,700
okay change of plans
 

655
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,530
okay change of plans
can we put it on I doubt it

656
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,540
can we put it on I doubt it
 

657
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,950
can we put it on I doubt it
might be able to go on netherrack though

658
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:07,960
might be able to go on netherrack though
 

659
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,890
might be able to go on netherrack though
actually okay okay we got our answer so

660
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:11,900
actually okay okay we got our answer so
 

661
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,620
actually okay okay we got our answer so
I believe that kills these guys yeah

662
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:14,630
I believe that kills these guys yeah
 

663
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,630
I believe that kills these guys yeah
okay and then we just run a minecart

664
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:16,640
okay and then we just run a minecart
 

665
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,250
okay and then we just run a minecart
under that hopper minecart took up two

666
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,260
under that hopper minecart took up two
 

667
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,380
under that hopper minecart took up two
drops I think we're gonna mine out some

668
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,390
drops I think we're gonna mine out some
 

669
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,880
drops I think we're gonna mine out some
of this nether brick as well it's in the

670
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:21,890
of this nether brick as well it's in the
 

671
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,460
of this nether brick as well it's in the
way okay so we got a bit of a decision

672
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,470
way okay so we got a bit of a decision
 

673
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,110
way okay so we got a bit of a decision
to make with this I think ideally you

674
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,120
to make with this I think ideally you
 

675
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
to make with this I think ideally you
would want to have 11 by 11 room for

676
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:28,730
would want to have 11 by 11 room for
 

677
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,790
would want to have 11 by 11 room for
spawning these guys in we might only go

678
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
spawning these guys in we might only go
 

679
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,460
spawning these guys in we might only go
to 9 by 9 actually because if we go one

680
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,470
to 9 by 9 actually because if we go one
 

681
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,950
to 9 by 9 actually because if we go one
two three four five blocks from there

682
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:38,960
two three four five blocks from there
 

683
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,910
two three four five blocks from there
we're gonna have to start tearing down

684
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
we're gonna have to start tearing down
 

685
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,370
we're gonna have to start tearing down
some of those black stone and and bust

686
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,380
some of those black stone and and bust
 

687
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,780
some of those black stone and and bust
up the natural design of our structure

688
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:45,790
up the natural design of our structure
 

689
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,980
up the natural design of our structure
which I don't think we really want to do

690
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:47,990
which I don't think we really want to do
 

691
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,500
which I don't think we really want to do
but like if a big slime tries to spawn

692
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:50,510
but like if a big slime tries to spawn
 

693
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,870
but like if a big slime tries to spawn
here and we got a wall I think that

694
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
here and we got a wall I think that
 

695
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,240
here and we got a wall I think that
might cause it to fail then and probably

696
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,250
might cause it to fail then and probably
 

697
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,490
might cause it to fail then and probably
get a little bit less cool so we got a

698
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:57,500
get a little bit less cool so we got a
 

699
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,140
get a little bit less cool so we got a
bit of a cage setup for these guys we

700
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,150
bit of a cage setup for these guys we
 

701
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,690
bit of a cage setup for these guys we
got glass around it and it's just a 9 by

702
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:01,700
got glass around it and it's just a 9 by
 

703
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,730
got glass around it and it's just a 9 by
9 and I don't have enough with the Roses

704
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:03,740
9 and I don't have enough with the Roses
 

705
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,080
9 and I don't have enough with the Roses
to fill the whole thing so I just put it

706
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,090
to fill the whole thing so I just put it
 

707
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,520
to fill the whole thing so I just put it
around the edges and a bit in the middle

708
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:06,530
around the edges and a bit in the middle
 

709
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,500
around the edges and a bit in the middle
and that seems to be killing them pretty

710
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:08,510
and that seems to be killing them pretty
 

711
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,750
and that seems to be killing them pretty
quickly though just as it is now we

712
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:10,760
quickly though just as it is now we
 

713
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,430
quickly though just as it is now we
gotta run a minecart track under that

714
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,440
gotta run a minecart track under that
 

715
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,800
gotta run a minecart track under that
for the hopper minecart so that is

716
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:14,810
for the hopper minecart so that is
 

717
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,920
for the hopper minecart so that is
tricky to install I'm going underneath

718
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:17,930
tricky to install I'm going underneath
 

719
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,280
tricky to install I'm going underneath
the nether rack and I like bust it open

720
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,290
the nether rack and I like bust it open
 

721
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,500
the nether rack and I like bust it open
and then lava pours in my face and I put

722
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,510
and then lava pours in my face and I put
 

723
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,620
and then lava pours in my face and I put
down a couple blocks and then hopefully

724
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:26,630
down a couple blocks and then hopefully
 

725
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:33,250
down a couple blocks and then hopefully
get rid of a bit of it okay so we got

726
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,260
get rid of a bit of it okay so we got
 

727
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,690
get rid of a bit of it okay so we got
the track installed here this is where

728
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:34,700
the track installed here this is where
 

729
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,520
the track installed here this is where
it starts in it zigzags its way down

730
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,530
it starts in it zigzags its way down
 

731
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,900
it starts in it zigzags its way down
there and then wraps around to the end

732
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:37,910
there and then wraps around to the end
 

733
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,940
there and then wraps around to the end
and then bounces back and comes through

734
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:39,950
and then bounces back and comes through
 

735
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,710
and then bounces back and comes through
the zigzag over here so we got to build

736
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:41,720
the zigzag over here so we got to build
 

737
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,270
the zigzag over here so we got to build
some kind of unloading station and

738
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,280
some kind of unloading station and
 

739
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,510
some kind of unloading station and
storage system over here or the magma

740
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:46,520
storage system over here or the magma
 

741
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
storage system over here or the magma
cream so I'm gonna put down probably

742
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,530
cream so I'm gonna put down probably
 

743
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,620
cream so I'm gonna put down probably
just three double chests of space

744
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,630
just three double chests of space
 

745
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,450
just three double chests of space
starting here there's lava all around

746
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:55,460
starting here there's lava all around
 

747
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,140
starting here there's lava all around
here by the way you can see outside oh

748
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,150
here by the way you can see outside oh
 

749
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,640
here by the way you can see outside oh
maybe you can't see outside but that's

750
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:00,650
maybe you can't see outside but that's
 

751
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,560
maybe you can't see outside but that's
the bridge out there so we're at the

752
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,570
the bridge out there so we're at the
 

753
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,070
the bridge out there so we're at the
very edge we're gonna put down some

754
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,080
very edge we're gonna put down some
 

755
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,270
very edge we're gonna put down some
hoppers OOP OOP OOP into the chests and

756
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,280
hoppers OOP OOP OOP into the chests and
 

757
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,489
hoppers OOP OOP OOP into the chests and
then one more over here

758
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:12,499
then one more over here
 

759
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,549
then one more over here
then this is where we're gonna do the

760
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:15,559
then this is where we're gonna do the
 

761
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,999
then this is where we're gonna do the
unloading right here we just need a

762
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:18,009
unloading right here we just need a
 

763
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:22,259
unloading right here we just need a
comparator then the redstone torch

764
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:22,269
comparator then the redstone torch
 

765
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,749
comparator then the redstone torch
that'll go to a piece of redstone up

766
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:25,759
that'll go to a piece of redstone up
 

767
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,869
that'll go to a piece of redstone up
here and that'll stop the minecart if it

768
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:28,879
here and that'll stop the minecart if it
 

769
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,139
here and that'll stop the minecart if it
has any items in there here comes and it

770
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,149
has any items in there here comes and it
 

771
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,829
has any items in there here comes and it
stops very good uh-oh I don't know what

772
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
stops very good uh-oh I don't know what
 

773
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,989
stops very good uh-oh I don't know what
happened so while I was building this I

774
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:37,999
happened so while I was building this I
 

775
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,519
happened so while I was building this I
wasn't really watching things I see some

776
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:39,529
wasn't really watching things I see some
 

777
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,619
wasn't really watching things I see some
magma slimes jumping around outside of

778
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:41,629
magma slimes jumping around outside of
 

779
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,359
magma slimes jumping around outside of
the glass and I don't know if they like

780
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,369
the glass and I don't know if they like
 

781
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,759
the glass and I don't know if they like
came from higher up in the structure and

782
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:45,769
came from higher up in the structure and
 

783
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,159
came from higher up in the structure and
fell down and the lava here or somehow

784
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,169
fell down and the lava here or somehow
 

785
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,499
fell down and the lava here or somehow
these guys are spawning outside we'll

786
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:50,509
these guys are spawning outside we'll
 

787
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:51,909
these guys are spawning outside we'll
have to watch it a bit more maybe we

788
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:51,919
have to watch it a bit more maybe we
 

789
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,329
have to watch it a bit more maybe we
need to expand our area well yeah I just

790
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:55,339
need to expand our area well yeah I just
 

791
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,099
need to expand our area well yeah I just
set up some scaffolding to get down here

792
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:57,109
set up some scaffolding to get down here
 

793
00:15:57,109 --> 00:16:00,579
set up some scaffolding to get down here
right now and this is our storage all

794
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:00,589
right now and this is our storage all
 

795
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,879
right now and this is our storage all
automatic should be good anyways I think

796
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:03,889
automatic should be good anyways I think
 

797
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,049
automatic should be good anyways I think
we should get out of the nether for a

798
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:05,059
we should get out of the nether for a
 

799
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:07,749
we should get out of the nether for a
bit here and change things up maybe what

800
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
bit here and change things up maybe what
 

801
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,369
bit here and change things up maybe what
do you think of my concrete maker here

802
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:09,379
do you think of my concrete maker here
 

803
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:13,029
do you think of my concrete maker here
pretty fancy you know what we don't have

804
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:13,039
pretty fancy you know what we don't have
 

805
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,829
pretty fancy you know what we don't have
in our world yet is a concrete maker I

806
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:14,839
in our world yet is a concrete maker I
 

807
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,899
in our world yet is a concrete maker I
just realized like we have one but it's

808
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:16,909
just realized like we have one but it's
 

809
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,389
just realized like we have one but it's
a manual mind one I would kind of like

810
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:19,399
a manual mind one I would kind of like
 

811
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,609
a manual mind one I would kind of like
to set up a TNT one so I've been

812
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:21,619
to set up a TNT one so I've been
 

813
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,439
to set up a TNT one so I've been
thinking we should make the most

814
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:23,449
thinking we should make the most
 

815
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:29,519
thinking we should make the most
ultimate amazing concrete maker yes

816
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:29,529
ultimate amazing concrete maker yes
 

817
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,019
ultimate amazing concrete maker yes
alternatively though we could just make

818
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:32,029
alternatively though we could just make
 

819
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:37,869
alternatively though we could just make
Ethos janky concrete maker oh yes that

820
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:37,879
Ethos janky concrete maker oh yes that
 

821
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,819
Ethos janky concrete maker oh yes that
sounds more like it so it's been a while

822
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:39,829
sounds more like it so it's been a while
 

823
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,409
sounds more like it so it's been a while
since we did any projects in the man

824
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:41,419
since we did any projects in the man
 

825
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,689
since we did any projects in the man
cave and we want this thing covered out

826
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:43,699
cave and we want this thing covered out
 

827
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,399
cave and we want this thing covered out
we don't want to see it it's it's gonna

828
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:45,409
we don't want to see it it's it's gonna
 

829
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,999
we don't want to see it it's it's gonna
be pretty janky and so I thought we

830
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:49,009
be pretty janky and so I thought we
 

831
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,039
be pretty janky and so I thought we
would put it over here actually I've

832
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,049
would put it over here actually I've
 

833
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,889
would put it over here actually I've
been looking around and I found a

834
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:53,899
been looking around and I found a
 

835
00:16:53,899 --> 00:17:00,189
been looking around and I found a
skeleton spawner over here so maybe we

836
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:00,199
skeleton spawner over here so maybe we
 

837
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,409
skeleton spawner over here so maybe we
could sort of take advantage of that as

838
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:02,419
could sort of take advantage of that as
 

839
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,139
could sort of take advantage of that as
we're making concrete's not today well

840
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:05,149
we're making concrete's not today well
 

841
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,399
we're making concrete's not today well
we won't set that up today but maybe

842
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:06,409
we won't set that up today but maybe
 

843
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,259
we won't set that up today but maybe
eventually this would be an odd number

844
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:08,269
eventually this would be an odd number
 

845
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,090
eventually this would be an odd number
over here yeah okay this is gonna be our

846
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,100
over here yeah okay this is gonna be our
 

847
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,579
over here yeah okay this is gonna be our
spot right here this is where we're

848
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:12,589
spot right here this is where we're
 

849
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,929
spot right here this is where we're
gonna stand to make concrete this is

850
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:16,939
gonna stand to make concrete this is
 

851
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,279
gonna stand to make concrete this is
level over here maybe we should go down

852
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:18,289
level over here maybe we should go down
 

853
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,259
level over here maybe we should go down
a couple blocks to change up the terrain

854
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:20,269
a couple blocks to change up the terrain
 

855
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:23,829
a couple blocks to change up the terrain
a bit - all right let's go down at least

856
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
a bit - all right let's go down at least
 

857
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,630
a bit - all right let's go down at least
one maybe two

858
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:25,640
one maybe two
 

859
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,190
one maybe two
all right everybody so we got a bit of

860
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:27,200
all right everybody so we got a bit of
 

861
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,750
all right everybody so we got a bit of
an area cleared out here I think we need

862
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:28,760
an area cleared out here I think we need
 

863
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,050
an area cleared out here I think we need
like a 15 by 5 by 6 tall area roughly

864
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,060
like a 15 by 5 by 6 tall area roughly
 

865
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,670
like a 15 by 5 by 6 tall area roughly
maybe a little bit more than that but

866
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:33,680
maybe a little bit more than that but
 

867
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,610
maybe a little bit more than that but
this should be pretty close um anyways

868
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:36,620
this should be pretty close um anyways
 

869
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,050
this should be pretty close um anyways
let's get started on building this thing

870
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,060
let's get started on building this thing
 

871
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:43,960
let's get started on building this thing
so the back story behind this is like I

872
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:43,970
so the back story behind this is like I
 

873
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,070
so the back story behind this is like I
do actually know how to make a good

874
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,080
do actually know how to make a good
 

875
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,510
do actually know how to make a good
concrete maker but we're making this

876
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:46,520
concrete maker but we're making this
 

877
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,610
concrete maker but we're making this
janky one just because I love it so much

878
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:48,620
janky one just because I love it so much
 

879
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,770
janky one just because I love it so much
I was messing around in creative the

880
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:50,780
I was messing around in creative the
 

881
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,560
I was messing around in creative the
other day and I got to thinking I wonder

882
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:53,570
other day and I got to thinking I wonder
 

883
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,630
other day and I got to thinking I wonder
if I could use the noteblock smart

884
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:55,640
if I could use the noteblock smart
 

885
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,480
if I could use the noteblock smart
piston trick to create like a weird

886
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,490
piston trick to create like a weird
 

887
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,320
piston trick to create like a weird
concrete maker and I messed around with

888
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,330
concrete maker and I messed around with
 

889
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,700
concrete maker and I messed around with
it for a bit I wasn't sure like how it

890
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:03,710
it for a bit I wasn't sure like how it
 

891
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,780
it for a bit I wasn't sure like how it
would work how it would function all

892
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:04,790
would work how it would function all
 

893
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,130
would work how it would function all
that kind of stuff and it ended up

894
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,140
that kind of stuff and it ended up
 

895
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,440
that kind of stuff and it ended up
working actually pretty decently and

896
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,450
working actually pretty decently and
 

897
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,840
working actually pretty decently and
it's among one of the easier concrete

898
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,850
it's among one of the easier concrete
 

899
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,550
it's among one of the easier concrete
makers to build I would say so

900
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:12,560
makers to build I would say so
 

901
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,040
makers to build I would say so
I kind of liked it ok so yeah we built

902
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,050
I kind of liked it ok so yeah we built
 

903
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,850
I kind of liked it ok so yeah we built
these noteblock smart Pistons like this

904
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:17,860
these noteblock smart Pistons like this
 

905
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,010
these noteblock smart Pistons like this
in order to do and because concrete

906
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,020
in order to do and because concrete
 

907
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,250
in order to do and because concrete
changes the note on the note block when

908
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:24,260
changes the note on the note block when
 

909
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,900
changes the note on the note block when
we put it there it actually activates so

910
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:25,910
we put it there it actually activates so
 

911
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,060
we put it there it actually activates so
all of these are smart Pistons so then

912
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,070
all of these are smart Pistons so then
 

913
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,710
all of these are smart Pistons so then
we take our smart piston thing here and

914
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:29,720
we take our smart piston thing here and
 

915
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,570
we take our smart piston thing here and
we stack another one right on top of it

916
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:31,580
we stack another one right on top of it
 

917
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,970
we stack another one right on top of it
and I just realized it's actually seven

918
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:33,980
and I just realized it's actually seven
 

919
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,030
and I just realized it's actually seven
blocks wide and not five and so at the

920
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,040
blocks wide and not five and so at the
 

921
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,590
blocks wide and not five and so at the
note block level here we go out four

922
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:38,600
note block level here we go out four
 

923
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,180
note block level here we go out four
blocks on the side I think we can use

924
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,190
blocks on the side I think we can use
 

925
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,860
blocks on the side I think we can use
glass for this but we'll find out I

926
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:41,870
glass for this but we'll find out I
 

927
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,250
glass for this but we'll find out I
guess and then we're gonna put water

928
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,260
guess and then we're gonna put water
 

929
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,960
guess and then we're gonna put water
right in front of these note blocks and

930
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:46,970
right in front of these note blocks and
 

931
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,820
right in front of these note blocks and
we do that up here as well for these

932
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,830
we do that up here as well for these
 

933
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,320
we do that up here as well for these
note blocks you can see I made a bit of

934
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,330
note blocks you can see I made a bit of
 

935
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,260
note blocks you can see I made a bit of
a glass holding area for it

936
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,270
a glass holding area for it
 

937
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,970
a glass holding area for it
there we go all our waters in okay so

938
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:54,980
there we go all our waters in okay so
 

939
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,620
there we go all our waters in okay so
check this out this is the fun part now

940
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,630
check this out this is the fun part now
 

941
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,840
check this out this is the fun part now
we just spam our concrete powder in here

942
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:58,850
we just spam our concrete powder in here
 

943
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,790
we just spam our concrete powder in here
and it kind of builds itself and you see

944
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:03,800
and it kind of builds itself and you see
 

945
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,470
and it kind of builds itself and you see
once one of them fills up the next one

946
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:05,480
once one of them fills up the next one
 

947
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,780
once one of them fills up the next one
goes and it passes underneath the water

948
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:07,790
goes and it passes underneath the water
 

949
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,590
goes and it passes underneath the water
there which turns it to solid concrete

950
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
there which turns it to solid concrete
 

951
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,990
there which turns it to solid concrete
all right that's totally full now and

952
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
all right that's totally full now and
 

953
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,070
all right that's totally full now and
now we're gonna go up three blocks here

954
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
now we're gonna go up three blocks here
 

955
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,870
now we're gonna go up three blocks here
I'm going to put two ladders on the side

956
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm going to put two ladders on the side
 

957
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,910
I'm going to put two ladders on the side
here for climbing up to this level and

958
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:21,920
here for climbing up to this level and
 

959
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,410
here for climbing up to this level and
we do the same thing all right so that's

960
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,420
we do the same thing all right so that's
 

961
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,270
we do the same thing all right so that's
all done now next step we're gonna do

962
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,280
all done now next step we're gonna do
 

963
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,950
all done now next step we're gonna do
the redstone on this so this is the

964
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:29,960
the redstone on this so this is the
 

965
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,200
the redstone on this so this is the
pressure plate to trigger the device and

966
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,210
pressure plate to trigger the device and
 

967
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,580
pressure plate to trigger the device and
then I think we run redstone to mana

968
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:36,590
then I think we run redstone to mana
 

969
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,910
then I think we run redstone to mana
stable circuit here sticky piston with a

970
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:39,920
stable circuit here sticky piston with a
 

971
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,480
stable circuit here sticky piston with a
redstone repeater at one they're gonna

972
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,490
redstone repeater at one they're gonna
 

973
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,130
redstone repeater at one they're gonna
wash away it's gonna wash away isn't it

974
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,140
wash away it's gonna wash away isn't it
 

975
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,180
wash away it's gonna wash away isn't it
I think we gotta put that there for

976
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,190
I think we gotta put that there for
 

977
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:53,980
I think we gotta put that there for
right now and then a trap door whoa all

978
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:53,990
right now and then a trap door whoa all
 

979
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,190
right now and then a trap door whoa all
right

980
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,200
right
 

981
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,660
right
and then we got to build some observers

982
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:55,670
and then we got to build some observers
 

983
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,850
and then we got to build some observers
up from that we gotta go to up washed

984
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:00,860
up from that we gotta go to up washed
 

985
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,180
up from that we gotta go to up washed
away

986
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,190
away
 

987
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,970
away
I know it's another one on top and then

988
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:03,980
I know it's another one on top and then
 

989
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,570
I know it's another one on top and then
more observers going this way into a

990
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:06,580
more observers going this way into a
 

991
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,660
more observers going this way into a
dispenser this is where the TNT goes and

992
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:10,670
dispenser this is where the TNT goes and
 

993
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,640
dispenser this is where the TNT goes and
then two more observers going this way

994
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,650
then two more observers going this way
 

995
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,220
then two more observers going this way
now we're free to remove this I think

996
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,230
now we're free to remove this I think
 

997
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,990
now we're free to remove this I think
what did I say seven blocks wide I meant

998
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,000
what did I say seven blocks wide I meant
 

999
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,760
what did I say seven blocks wide I meant
eight of course I forgot we got four

1000
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:18,770
eight of course I forgot we got four
 

1001
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,740
eight of course I forgot we got four
that hopper clock here all right let's

1002
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:20,750
that hopper clock here all right let's
 

1003
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,600
that hopper clock here all right let's
get an opera clock set up so we're gonna

1004
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,610
get an opera clock set up so we're gonna
 

1005
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,380
get an opera clock set up so we're gonna
go comparators from the hoppers base the

1006
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,390
go comparators from the hoppers base the
 

1007
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,680
go comparators from the hoppers base the
hoppers into each other double block

1008
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:28,690
hoppers into each other double block
 

1009
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,290
hoppers into each other double block
double redstone sticky piston on the

1010
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:32,300
double redstone sticky piston on the
 

1011
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,590
double redstone sticky piston on the
side with the observers and then regular

1012
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
side with the observers and then regular
 

1013
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,920
side with the observers and then regular
piston on the other side redstone block

1014
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:38,930
piston on the other side redstone block
 

1015
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,990
piston on the other side redstone block
between and we're gonna go for six items

1016
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,000
between and we're gonna go for six items
 

1017
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,730
between and we're gonna go for six items
in here one two three four five six BAM

1018
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:44,740
in here one two three four five six BAM
 

1019
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,230
in here one two three four five six BAM
all right and then it's probably a good

1020
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
all right and then it's probably a good
 

1021
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,270
all right and then it's probably a good
idea to cover over this too with a

1022
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
idea to cover over this too with a
 

1023
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,770
idea to cover over this too with a
couple blocks so nothing falls in there

1024
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:50,780
couple blocks so nothing falls in there
 

1025
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,390
couple blocks so nothing falls in there
and then from the hopper clock we're

1026
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
and then from the hopper clock we're
 

1027
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,240
and then from the hopper clock we're
gonna put a trapdoor and I think we're

1028
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,250
gonna put a trapdoor and I think we're
 

1029
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,070
gonna put a trapdoor and I think we're
gonna want to jump in here actually just

1030
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,080
gonna want to jump in here actually just
 

1031
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,200
gonna want to jump in here actually just
to make this easier but the observer

1032
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,210
to make this easier but the observer
 

1033
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,810
to make this easier but the observer
next to the trapdoor then one two three

1034
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:01,820
next to the trapdoor then one two three
 

1035
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,760
next to the trapdoor then one two three
four five pieces of redstone over top of

1036
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:03,770
four five pieces of redstone over top of
 

1037
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,770
four five pieces of redstone over top of
that and then from here we take another

1038
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:05,780
that and then from here we take another
 

1039
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,780
that and then from here we take another
observer and go up into a block into six

1040
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:10,790
observer and go up into a block into six
 

1041
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,460
observer and go up into a block into six
pieces of redstone over the observers

1042
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,470
pieces of redstone over the observers
 

1043
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,380
pieces of redstone over the observers
again now we're gonna build the blast

1044
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,390
again now we're gonna build the blast
 

1045
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,180
again now we're gonna build the blast
chamber and collection system for this

1046
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,190
chamber and collection system for this
 

1047
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,310
chamber and collection system for this
thing so we shave off the ends of these

1048
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
thing so we shave off the ends of these
 

1049
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,770
thing so we shave off the ends of these
as far as the Pistons will reach shave

1050
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:20,780
as far as the Pistons will reach shave
 

1051
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,390
as far as the Pistons will reach shave
off the final blocks here and then

1052
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
off the final blocks here and then
 

1053
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,440
off the final blocks here and then
either with obsidian or

1054
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,450
either with obsidian or
 

1055
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,330
either with obsidian or
some other blast-resistant block like

1056
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,340
some other blast-resistant block like
 

1057
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,540
some other blast-resistant block like
crying obsidian we're gonna a solid fill

1058
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:29,550
crying obsidian we're gonna a solid fill
 

1059
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,700
crying obsidian we're gonna a solid fill
this we also want to put up sitting

1060
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:31,710
this we also want to put up sitting
 

1061
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,200
this we also want to put up sitting
above the second layer of the concrete

1062
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,210
above the second layer of the concrete
 

1063
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,210
above the second layer of the concrete
here just to stop it from jumping out

1064
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,220
here just to stop it from jumping out
 

1065
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,490
here just to stop it from jumping out
places we don't want it to and then

1066
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,500
places we don't want it to and then
 

1067
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,320
places we don't want it to and then
again we just cover the sides here or

1068
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,330
again we just cover the sides here or
 

1069
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,120
again we just cover the sides here or
blocks from the end and do a 4x4 thing

1070
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,130
blocks from the end and do a 4x4 thing
 

1071
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,100
blocks from the end and do a 4x4 thing
we got a two block gap here we're gonna

1072
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,110
we got a two block gap here we're gonna
 

1073
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,840
we got a two block gap here we're gonna
fill that in with concrete to stop the

1074
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:47,850
fill that in with concrete to stop the
 

1075
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,510
fill that in with concrete to stop the
water from flowing down probably can

1076
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:50,520
water from flowing down probably can
 

1077
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,130
water from flowing down probably can
load the TNT in here but a lot didn't

1078
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,140
load the TNT in here but a lot didn't
 

1079
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,780
load the TNT in here but a lot didn't
careful

1080
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:52,790
careful
 

1081
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,100
careful
and then let's fill this two block gap

1082
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,110
and then let's fill this two block gap
 

1083
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,280
and then let's fill this two block gap
as well and now we're gonna dig

1084
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,290
as well and now we're gonna dig
 

1085
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,870
as well and now we're gonna dig
underneath here and start adding our

1086
00:21:59,870 --> 00:21:59,880
underneath here and start adding our
 

1087
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,360
underneath here and start adding our
collection system unfortunately because

1088
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,370
collection system unfortunately because
 

1089
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,580
collection system unfortunately because
I'm in the man cave we've got stuff kind

1090
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:04,590
I'm in the man cave we've got stuff kind
 

1091
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,890
I'm in the man cave we've got stuff kind
of all over the place in our way rying

1092
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:06,900
of all over the place in our way rying
 

1093
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,150
of all over the place in our way rying
obsidian actually looks pretty weird

1094
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,160
obsidian actually looks pretty weird
 

1095
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,130
obsidian actually looks pretty weird
doesn't it it's almost like it's round

1096
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,140
doesn't it it's almost like it's round
 

1097
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,620
doesn't it it's almost like it's round
like the dark areas look like they go in

1098
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,630
like the dark areas look like they go in
 

1099
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,010
like the dark areas look like they go in
more you see what I you see that it's

1100
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,020
more you see what I you see that it's
 

1101
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,150
more you see what I you see that it's
almost like a bunch of dragon eggs

1102
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,160
almost like a bunch of dragon eggs
 

1103
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
almost like a bunch of dragon eggs
stacked on top of each other they make a

1104
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,170
stacked on top of each other they make a
 

1105
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,700
stacked on top of each other they make a
big dragon egg here anyways I put a

1106
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,710
big dragon egg here anyways I put a
 

1107
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,400
big dragon egg here anyways I put a
bunch of crying obsidian around here as

1108
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,410
bunch of crying obsidian around here as
 

1109
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,610
bunch of crying obsidian around here as
well and then on the floor so that we if

1110
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:28,620
well and then on the floor so that we if
 

1111
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,410
well and then on the floor so that we if
we have an accident it's not gonna blow

1112
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:30,420
we have an accident it's not gonna blow
 

1113
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,350
we have an accident it's not gonna blow
up the wiring below hopefully now I'm

1114
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
up the wiring below hopefully now I'm
 

1115
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,540
up the wiring below hopefully now I'm
gonna punch these four blocks out we're

1116
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,550
gonna punch these four blocks out we're
 

1117
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,110
gonna punch these four blocks out we're
gonna set some hoppers into a chest both

1118
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
gonna set some hoppers into a chest both
 

1119
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,670
gonna set some hoppers into a chest both
in facing in and these ones will goes

1120
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:40,680
in facing in and these ones will goes
 

1121
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,490
in facing in and these ones will goes
sideways into those then I think we're

1122
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,500
sideways into those then I think we're
 

1123
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,600
sideways into those then I think we're
ready to put our water in awesome so I

1124
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,610
ready to put our water in awesome so I
 

1125
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,190
ready to put our water in awesome so I
think is ready now we're gonna do some

1126
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
think is ready now we're gonna do some
 

1127
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,410
think is ready now we're gonna do some
testing I just want to point out one

1128
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:51,420
testing I just want to point out one
 

1129
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,090
testing I just want to point out one
thing with this water it actually does

1130
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,100
thing with this water it actually does
 

1131
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,130
thing with this water it actually does
three different things three different

1132
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,140
three different things three different
 

1133
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,800
three different things three different
functions it turns the concrete powder

1134
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:57,810
functions it turns the concrete powder
 

1135
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,410
functions it turns the concrete powder
into solid concrete it's also gonna move

1136
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,420
into solid concrete it's also gonna move
 

1137
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
into solid concrete it's also gonna move
the TNT like the TNT is gonna fall over

1138
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,430
the TNT like the TNT is gonna fall over
 

1139
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,870
the TNT like the TNT is gonna fall over
here and then it pushes it over to where

1140
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:05,880
here and then it pushes it over to where
 

1141
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,280
here and then it pushes it over to where
there's no water and then the TNT

1142
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,290
there's no water and then the TNT
 

1143
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,080
there's no water and then the TNT
explodes over there far enough away from

1144
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,090
explodes over there far enough away from
 

1145
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,450
explodes over there far enough away from
the gizmos and stuff where they

1146
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,460
the gizmos and stuff where they
 

1147
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,090
the gizmos and stuff where they
shouldn't break and then also the water

1148
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,100
shouldn't break and then also the water
 

1149
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,390
shouldn't break and then also the water
will push any drops any of the concrete

1150
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
will push any drops any of the concrete
 

1151
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,220
will push any drops any of the concrete
that lands over here off into our

1152
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,230
that lands over here off into our
 

1153
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,870
that lands over here off into our
collection system so that's pretty cool

1154
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
collection system so that's pretty cool
 

1155
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,290
collection system so that's pretty cool
now we're looking for when we hit the

1156
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:24,300
now we're looking for when we hit the
 

1157
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,060
now we're looking for when we hit the
button here we want the TNT to explode

1158
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,070
button here we want the TNT to explode
 

1159
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,410
button here we want the TNT to explode
the stuff we want the stuff to go into

1160
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:27,420
the stuff we want the stuff to go into
 

1161
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,290
the stuff we want the stuff to go into
the chest but we also want this concrete

1162
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,300
the chest but we also want this concrete
 

1163
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,930
the chest but we also want this concrete
powder to get moved over so that we're

1164
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:32,940
powder to get moved over so that we're
 

1165
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,190
powder to get moved over so that we're
free to put new stuff there because

1166
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,200
free to put new stuff there because
 

1167
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,310
free to put new stuff there because
right now it's like hacked up it's full

1168
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
right now it's like hacked up it's full
 

1169
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,440
right now it's like hacked up it's full
let's this hope all that happen

1170
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,450
let's this hope all that happen
 

1171
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:46,180
let's this hope all that happen
he's a teen he moves over oh just making

1172
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,190
he's a teen he moves over oh just making
 

1173
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,080
he's a teen he moves over oh just making
sure nothing got destroyed it looks like

1174
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,090
sure nothing got destroyed it looks like
 

1175
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,760
sure nothing got destroyed it looks like
okay oh yeah any heard the Pistons fire

1176
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:51,770
okay oh yeah any heard the Pistons fire
 

1177
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,650
okay oh yeah any heard the Pistons fire
afterwards so now this spot is free for

1178
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:53,660
afterwards so now this spot is free for
 

1179
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,370
afterwards so now this spot is free for
new concrete powder so that's cool and

1180
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:57,380
new concrete powder so that's cool and
 

1181
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:04,360
new concrete powder so that's cool and
now let's see what we got four drops 49

1182
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,370
now let's see what we got four drops 49
 

1183
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,980
now let's see what we got four drops 49
okay uh-huh

1184
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:05,990
okay uh-huh
 

1185
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,540
okay uh-huh
so some concrete makers they can get

1186
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:07,550
so some concrete makers they can get
 

1187
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,720
so some concrete makers they can get
over a hundred per TNT but let's face it

1188
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:09,730
over a hundred per TNT but let's face it
 

1189
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,920
over a hundred per TNT but let's face it
those are show-offs we don't want to

1190
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:11,930
those are show-offs we don't want to
 

1191
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,670
those are show-offs we don't want to
show off fully automatic a table

1192
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:15,680
show off fully automatic a table
 

1193
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,570
show off fully automatic a table
concrete maker

1194
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:16,580
concrete maker
 

1195
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,030
concrete maker
none of that garbage we want the manual

1196
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,040
none of that garbage we want the manual
 

1197
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,550
none of that garbage we want the manual
do-it-yourself so we load up the top we

1198
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:24,560
do-it-yourself so we load up the top we
 

1199
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,320
do-it-yourself so we load up the top we
fall down on the pressure plate and

1200
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,330
fall down on the pressure plate and
 

1201
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,580
fall down on the pressure plate and
pretty much the time we finish it pops

1202
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,590
pretty much the time we finish it pops
 

1203
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,780
pretty much the time we finish it pops
and then we go back up we climb the

1204
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:31,790
and then we go back up we climb the
 

1205
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,090
and then we go back up we climb the
ladder ideally you don't want to be

1206
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,100
ladder ideally you don't want to be
 

1207
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,370
ladder ideally you don't want to be
moving your mouse around and ideally oh

1208
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:38,380
moving your mouse around and ideally oh
 

1209
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,870
moving your mouse around and ideally oh
how am I gonna feed myself more powders

1210
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
how am I gonna feed myself more powders
 

1211
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,790
how am I gonna feed myself more powders
the question

1212
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:43,800

 

1213
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,750

I didn't think about that anyways this

1214
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
I didn't think about that anyways this
 

1215
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,950
I didn't think about that anyways this
is kind of how it's supposed to function

1216
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
is kind of how it's supposed to function
 

1217
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,970
is kind of how it's supposed to function
it's pretty janky I love it we go up we

1218
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:52,980
it's pretty janky I love it we go up we
 

1219
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,280
it's pretty janky I love it we go up we
go down we hit the pressure plate get

1220
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,290
go down we hit the pressure plate get
 

1221
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,190
go down we hit the pressure plate get
the next one going run out of coffee

1222
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,200
the next one going run out of coffee
 

1223
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:05,210
the next one going run out of coffee
powder anyways it's kind of cool I liked

1224
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,220
powder anyways it's kind of cool I liked
 

1225
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,710
powder anyways it's kind of cool I liked
it we actually do have quite a bit of

1226
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
it we actually do have quite a bit of
 

1227
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
it we actually do have quite a bit of
space around your free still so it is

1228
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:08,730
space around your free still so it is
 

1229
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,610
space around your free still so it is
possible we could add a way of moving up

1230
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:10,620
possible we could add a way of moving up
 

1231
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,500
possible we could add a way of moving up
and down automatically and refilling our

1232
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,510
and down automatically and refilling our
 

1233
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,200
and down automatically and refilling our
concrete powder but I'll have to think

1234
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,210
concrete powder but I'll have to think
 

1235
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,000
concrete powder but I'll have to think
about how to do that if I really want to

1236
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,010
about how to do that if I really want to
 

1237
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,610
about how to do that if I really want to
do it I don't know I kind of like it the

1238
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:19,620
do it I don't know I kind of like it the
 

1239
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,420
do it I don't know I kind of like it the
way it is too but anyways let's get to

1240
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,430
way it is too but anyways let's get to
 

1241
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,270
way it is too but anyways let's get to
