00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:22,470
while exploring the abandoned mineshaft
 

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,550
while exploring the abandoned mineshaft
it's a these are about a hundred blocks

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560
it's a these are about a hundred blocks
 

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,810
it's a these are about a hundred blocks
away from that other cave spider system

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:29,820
away from that other cave spider system
 

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,380
away from that other cave spider system
I set up my new plan I want to make an

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,390
I set up my new plan I want to make an
 

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,510
I set up my new plan I want to make an
enchanting room and a cave spider system

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
enchanting room and a cave spider system
 

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,049
enchanting room and a cave spider system
combined into one here this is just so

18
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:42,059
combined into one here this is just so
 

19
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,130
combined into one here this is just so
perfect they're so close together this

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,140
perfect they're so close together this
 

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,770
perfect they're so close together this
is going to work out very well we also

22
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:48,780
is going to work out very well we also
 

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,930
is going to work out very well we also
have a ravine right next to us which is

24
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:50,940
have a ravine right next to us which is
 

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,549
have a ravine right next to us which is
nice lots of space the plan is I keep

26
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
nice lots of space the plan is I keep
 

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,470
nice lots of space the plan is I keep
saying the plan is the problem with the

28
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
saying the plan is the problem with the
 

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,779
saying the plan is the problem with the
last cave spider system is damaging the

30
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:02,789
last cave spider system is damaging the
 

31
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,509
last cave spider system is damaging the
mobs it's a little bit tricky I tried

32
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
mobs it's a little bit tricky I tried
 

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,030
mobs it's a little bit tricky I tried
messing around with cacti didn't work

34
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,040
messing around with cacti didn't work
 

35
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,810
messing around with cacti didn't work
too well haven't messed around with fire

36
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:11,820
too well haven't messed around with fire
 

37
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,440
too well haven't messed around with fire
or lava or anything yet just because

38
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,450
or lava or anything yet just because
 

39
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,740
or lava or anything yet just because
it'll be really messy I know but with

40
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,750
it'll be really messy I know but with
 

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,649
it'll be really messy I know but with
this this will work out perfect because

42
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
this this will work out perfect because
 

43
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,840
this this will work out perfect because
my plan is to I said it again didn't I

44
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:28,850
my plan is to I said it again didn't I
 

45
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,080
my plan is to I said it again didn't I
the idea is to go down make the spiders

46
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,090
the idea is to go down make the spiders
 

47
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,670
the idea is to go down make the spiders
fall about 12 blocks or so downward

48
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:36,680
fall about 12 blocks or so downward
 

49
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,350
fall about 12 blocks or so downward
because that takes spiders they have six

50
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
because that takes spiders they have six
 

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,850
because that takes spiders they have six
hearts health so if we drop them how

52
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:46,860
hearts health so if we drop them how
 

53
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,359
hearts health so if we drop them how
does it work out basically every block

54
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,369
does it work out basically every block
 

55
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,960
does it work out basically every block
they fall counts as half a heart of fall

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:53,970
they fall counts as half a heart of fall
 

57
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,230
they fall counts as half a heart of fall
damage so minus three blocks that they

58
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
damage so minus three blocks that they
 

59
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,959
damage so minus three blocks that they
fall at first so if we drop them ten

60
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:02,969
fall at first so if we drop them ten
 

61
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,449
fall at first so if we drop them ten
blocks they would take that's a 10 minus

62
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:08,459
blocks they would take that's a 10 minus
 

63
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,839
blocks they would take that's a 10 minus
3 is 7 and then

64
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:11,849
3 is 7 and then
 

65
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,699
3 is 7 and then
7/2 is three point five hearts damaged

66
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:16,709
7/2 is three point five hearts damaged
 

67
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,350
7/2 is three point five hearts damaged
now a stone sword does two and a half

68
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
now a stone sword does two and a half
 

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,420
now a stone sword does two and a half
hearts damage to two mobs so that works

70
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,430
hearts damage to two mobs so that works
 

71
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,460
hearts damage to two mobs so that works
out to six arts total so that should

72
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,470
out to six arts total so that should
 

73
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,280
out to six arts total so that should
kill them but I would like to go a

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,290
kill them but I would like to go a
 

75
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,440
kill them but I would like to go a
little bit further just to be sure

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,450
little bit further just to be sure
 

77
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,620
little bit further just to be sure
probably drop them down twelve blocks so

78
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,630
probably drop them down twelve blocks so
 

79
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,750
probably drop them down twelve blocks so
I'll set up like an enchanting room

80
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:36,760
I'll set up like an enchanting room
 

81
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,120
I'll set up like an enchanting room
twelve blocks below the center of these

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,130
twelve blocks below the center of these
 

83
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:45,410
twelve blocks below the center of these
two so like twelve blocks below here and

84
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:45,420
two so like twelve blocks below here and
 

85
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,030
two so like twelve blocks below here and
there'll be a one-hit kill with the

86
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
there'll be a one-hit kill with the
 

87
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,580
there'll be a one-hit kill with the
stone sword it should be nice yeah I

88
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:55,590
stone sword it should be nice yeah I
 

89
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,809
stone sword it should be nice yeah I
think it'll work out so I need to build

90
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:00,819
think it'll work out so I need to build
 

91
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,600
think it'll work out so I need to build
two dark rooms for them up here the

92
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:03,610
two dark rooms for them up here the
 

93
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,699
two dark rooms for them up here the
water streams will meet together drop

94
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:05,709
water streams will meet together drop
 

95
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,460
water streams will meet together drop
them down then there will be an

96
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,470
them down then there will be an
 

97
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,509
them down then there will be an
enchanting room nearby and I got some

98
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:12,519
enchanting room nearby and I got some
 

99
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,100
enchanting room nearby and I got some
other plants too we'll see how it goes

100
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,110
other plants too we'll see how it goes
 

101
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,539
other plants too we'll see how it goes
I'm going to get started here though

102
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:15,549
I'm going to get started here though
 

103
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm going to get started here though
I'll probably skip most of it because

104
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,130
I'll probably skip most of it because
 

105
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,460
I'll probably skip most of it because
you saw it last time don't want to bore

106
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,470
you saw it last time don't want to bore
 

107
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,170
you saw it last time don't want to bore
you too long and it's easier for me to

108
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,180
you too long and it's easier for me to
 

109
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,240
you too long and it's easier for me to
do it off camera okay here's a little

110
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,250
do it off camera okay here's a little
 

111
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,280
do it off camera okay here's a little
update for you guys on the project it's

112
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,290
update for you guys on the project it's
 

113
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,470
update for you guys on the project it's
going well you've got the dark rooms

114
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,480
going well you've got the dark rooms
 

115
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,819
going well you've got the dark rooms
built for both spawners

116
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:32,829
built for both spawners
 

117
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,539
built for both spawners
and they connect these rooms are eight

118
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:36,549
and they connect these rooms are eight
 

119
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,890
and they connect these rooms are eight
by eight and four high and that's to

120
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:40,900
by eight and four high and that's to
 

121
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,830
by eight and four high and that's to
maximize every single possible spawning

122
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
maximize every single possible spawning
 

123
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,660
maximize every single possible spawning
location for the spiders so the spiders

124
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:48,670
location for the spiders so the spiders
 

125
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,610
location for the spiders so the spiders
spawn as quick as possible so water will

126
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:53,620
spawn as quick as possible so water will
 

127
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,300
spawn as quick as possible so water will
flow from this wall to here and then

128
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,310
flow from this wall to here and then
 

129
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,759
flow from this wall to here and then
from that wall to here then we'll have

130
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:02,769
from that wall to here then we'll have
 

131
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:11,610
from that wall to here then we'll have
water down here hopefully I can get out

132
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:11,620
water down here hopefully I can get out
 

133
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,440
water down here hopefully I can get out
good that glitch is still in the game

134
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,450
good that glitch is still in the game
 

135
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,940
good that glitch is still in the game
where you sometimes can't get out if

136
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:15,950
where you sometimes can't get out if
 

137
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,080
where you sometimes can't get out if
you're facing a certain direction

138
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,090
you're facing a certain direction
 

139
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,390
you're facing a certain direction
okay and that goes to that point here

140
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
okay and that goes to that point here
 

141
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,710
okay and that goes to that point here
and then we put water in this one they

142
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
and then we put water in this one they
 

143
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,250
and then we put water in this one they
meet eight blocks long so no no need for

144
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,260
meet eight blocks long so no no need for
 

145
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,870
meet eight blocks long so no no need for
signs or anything which is always nice

146
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:31,880
signs or anything which is always nice
 

147
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,780
signs or anything which is always nice
and this as well as eight blocks long so

148
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:34,790
and this as well as eight blocks long so
 

149
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,600
and this as well as eight blocks long so
won't need any signs to hold the water

150
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,610
won't need any signs to hold the water
 

151
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,090
won't need any signs to hold the water
back and yeah I don't think the water

152
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,100
back and yeah I don't think the water
 

153
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,520
back and yeah I don't think the water
streams will conflict here should be

154
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,530
streams will conflict here should be
 

155
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,790
streams will conflict here should be
fine

156
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:45,800
fine
 

157
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,659
fine
and then yeah dig down I'll probably

158
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:52,669
and then yeah dig down I'll probably
 

159
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,960
and then yeah dig down I'll probably
have a piston shutoff thing to prevent

160
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:55,970
have a piston shutoff thing to prevent
 

161
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,980
have a piston shutoff thing to prevent
spiders from falling down if I need to

162
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,990
spiders from falling down if I need to
 

163
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,640
spiders from falling down if I need to
disable it quickly and I'll probably do

164
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,650
disable it quickly and I'll probably do
 

165
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,290
disable it quickly and I'll probably do
the lighting thing in this one as well

166
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,300
the lighting thing in this one as well
 

167
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,190
the lighting thing in this one as well
so I'll see you again shortly when I get

168
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,200
so I'll see you again shortly when I get
 

169
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,070
so I'll see you again shortly when I get
more done here so I have to set up a

170
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
more done here so I have to set up a
 

171
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,100
more done here so I have to set up a
little bit now I will need to make a few

172
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,110
little bit now I will need to make a few
 

173
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,420
little bit now I will need to make a few
adjustments of course generally with mob

174
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,430
adjustments of course generally with mob
 

175
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,190
adjustments of course generally with mob
systems you don't want to have a one

176
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,200
systems you don't want to have a one
 

177
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,130
systems you don't want to have a one
block hole from ops fall down because

178
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,140
block hole from ops fall down because
 

179
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,780
block hole from ops fall down because
usually they'll bump each other around

180
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:28,790
usually they'll bump each other around
 

181
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,790
usually they'll bump each other around
and they won't want to go down it there

182
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:33,800
and they won't want to go down it there
 

183
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,680
and they won't want to go down it there
there are tricks to making it work

184
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:35,690
there are tricks to making it work
 

185
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,469
there are tricks to making it work
though one thing I will need to do is

186
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
though one thing I will need to do is
 

187
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,690
though one thing I will need to do is
lower these these to one wide streams

188
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:43,700
lower these these to one wide streams
 

189
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,080
lower these these to one wide streams
one block at least that way when the

190
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,090
one block at least that way when the
 

191
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,580
one block at least that way when the
spiders bump each other they won't get

192
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,590
spiders bump each other they won't get
 

193
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:57,610
spiders bump each other they won't get
bumped out of those streams and fall

194
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:57,620
bumped out of those streams and fall
 

195
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,080
bumped out of those streams and fall
damage so far has been pretty

196
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,090
damage so far has been pretty
 

197
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,770
damage so far has been pretty
inconsistent sometimes the spiders die

198
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:02,780
inconsistent sometimes the spiders die
 

199
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,200
inconsistent sometimes the spiders die
from the fall

200
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,210
from the fall
 

201
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,700
from the fall
sometimes most of the time it's a

202
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:06,710
sometimes most of the time it's a
 

203
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,029
sometimes most of the time it's a
one-hit kill like I wanted other times

204
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,039
one-hit kill like I wanted other times
 

205
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,300
one-hit kill like I wanted other times
it's a two-bit kill and sometimes it's a

206
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,310
it's a two-bit kill and sometimes it's a
 

207
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,750
it's a two-bit kill and sometimes it's a
three-hit tool so it's hard to get it

208
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:16,760
three-hit tool so it's hard to get it
 

209
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,700
three-hit tool so it's hard to get it
consistent

210
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:20,710

 

211
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,650

and I just have a very rough setup down

212
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:23,660
and I just have a very rough setup down
 

213
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,400
and I just have a very rough setup down
here for now so you can see 1 hit 2 1

214
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,410
here for now so you can see 1 hit 2 1
 

215
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:37,110
here for now so you can see 1 hit 2 1
hit 2 1 hit kill most the time it's good

216
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120

 

217
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,159

there's a lot of dead spiders down here

218
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,169

 

219
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:48,340

yeah I got a half slab at the bottom

220
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,350
yeah I got a half slab at the bottom
 

221
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,950
yeah I got a half slab at the bottom
there so it's 1 2 3 and a half blocks

222
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
there so it's 1 2 3 and a half blocks
 

223
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,550
there so it's 1 2 3 and a half blocks
high which allows the spiders to I'm

224
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:57,560
high which allows the spiders to I'm
 

225
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,110
high which allows the spiders to I'm
around in there without taking fall

226
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
around in there without taking fall
 

227
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,480
around in there without taking fall
damage or I hope it does anyway because

228
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,490
damage or I hope it does anyway because
 

229
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,600
damage or I hope it does anyway because
mobs take damage if they fall more than

230
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,610
mobs take damage if they fall more than
 

231
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:18,520
mobs take damage if they fall more than
three and a half blocks but anyway yeah

232
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,530
three and a half blocks but anyway yeah
 

233
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,870
three and a half blocks but anyway yeah
you can see some are dying there um I'll

234
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
you can see some are dying there um I'll
 

235
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,140
you can see some are dying there um I'll
have to keep adjusting it and hopefully

236
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,150
have to keep adjusting it and hopefully
 

237
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,070
have to keep adjusting it and hopefully
I'll get it working the way I want it to

238
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll get it working the way I want it to
 

239
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,899
I'll get it working the way I want it to
so I'll see you again shortly yeah so

240
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:34,909
so I'll see you again shortly yeah so
 

241
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,670
so I'll see you again shortly yeah so
the cape spider stuff is going well I

242
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
the cape spider stuff is going well I
 

243
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,379
the cape spider stuff is going well I
decide to take a little break from it

244
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:38,389
decide to take a little break from it
 

245
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,439
decide to take a little break from it
though I did get up to about level 35

246
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:41,449
though I did get up to about level 35
 

247
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,879
though I did get up to about level 35
and I enchanted a diamond pickaxe so I

248
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:45,889
and I enchanted a diamond pickaxe so I
 

249
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,510
and I enchanted a diamond pickaxe so I
got unbreaking 3 on it and fortune 3 so

250
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
got unbreaking 3 on it and fortune 3 so
 

251
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,560
got unbreaking 3 on it and fortune 3 so
that'll be very handy when I go mining

252
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,570
that'll be very handy when I go mining
 

253
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,909
that'll be very handy when I go mining
hopefully I'll get some extra redstone

254
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:54,919
hopefully I'll get some extra redstone
 

255
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,510
hopefully I'll get some extra redstone
and stuff when I use it I'll definitely

256
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:58,520
and stuff when I use it I'll definitely
 

257
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,070
and stuff when I use it I'll definitely
have to start wearing armor though

258
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
have to start wearing armor though
 

259
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,730
have to start wearing armor though
because I don't trust not having armor

260
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:03,740
because I don't trust not having armor
 

261
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,540
because I don't trust not having armor
and something that valuable on me

262
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,550
and something that valuable on me
 

263
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,469
and something that valuable on me
but yet I wanted to start will not start

264
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:11,479
but yet I wanted to start will not start
 

265
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,310
but yet I wanted to start will not start
something but repair something I'm going

266
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,320
something but repair something I'm going
 

267
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,950
something but repair something I'm going
to do some work on the mushroom farm

268
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:17,960
to do some work on the mushroom farm
 

269
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,140
to do some work on the mushroom farm
here a lot of people like how small this

270
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,150
here a lot of people like how small this
 

271
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,730
here a lot of people like how small this
thing is it's pretty cool it's fairly

272
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:24,740
thing is it's pretty cool it's fairly
 

273
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,800
thing is it's pretty cool it's fairly
slow though it takes a long time for the

274
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:26,810
slow though it takes a long time for the
 

275
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,360
slow though it takes a long time for the
mushrooms to grow

276
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,370
mushrooms to grow
 

277
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,420
mushrooms to grow
I'm going to try and prove that a little

278
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,430
I'm going to try and prove that a little
 

279
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,390
I'm going to try and prove that a little
bit today by making it a little bit

280
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:34,400
bit today by making it a little bit
 

281
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,209
bit today by making it a little bit
bigger I planted down some mushrooms

282
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:37,219
bigger I planted down some mushrooms
 

283
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,959
bigger I planted down some mushrooms
here I wanted to see like yeah the way

284
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:40,969
here I wanted to see like yeah the way
 

285
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,890
here I wanted to see like yeah the way
it works as I've covered already you can

286
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:44,900
it works as I've covered already you can
 

287
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,930
it works as I've covered already you can
only have five mushrooms within a nine

288
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:46,940
only have five mushrooms within a nine
 

289
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,480
only have five mushrooms within a nine
by nine by three area I think that's

290
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,490
by nine by three area I think that's
 

291
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,010
by nine by three area I think that's
right

292
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,020
right
 

293
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,190
right
but the brown mushrooms and the red

294
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,200
but the brown mushrooms and the red
 

295
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,900
but the brown mushrooms and the red
mushrooms are separate so you can have

296
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:55,910
mushrooms are separate so you can have
 

297
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,269
mushrooms are separate so you can have
five brown mushrooms and five red

298
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:58,279
five brown mushrooms and five red
 

299
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,880
five brown mushrooms and five red
mushrooms in that nine by nine by three

300
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:00,890
mushrooms in that nine by nine by three
 

301
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,019
mushrooms in that nine by nine by three
area no problem so I'm going to I'm

302
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:05,029
area no problem so I'm going to I'm
 

303
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,550
area no problem so I'm going to I'm
going to put some brown mushrooms next

304
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
going to put some brown mushrooms next
 

305
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,880
going to put some brown mushrooms next
to our red mushrooms here give them a

306
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:09,890
to our red mushrooms here give them a
 

307
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,210
to our red mushrooms here give them a
little bit more space to UM see how do

308
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,220
little bit more space to UM see how do
 

309
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,340
little bit more space to UM see how do
we do this break down our glass we'll

310
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,350
we do this break down our glass we'll
 

311
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,390
we do this break down our glass we'll
have to get in there and some people

312
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,400
have to get in there and some people
 

313
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,950
have to get in there and some people
have been wondering about the iron tools

314
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:26,960
have been wondering about the iron tools
 

315
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,269
have been wondering about the iron tools
how come I got them all enchanted or how

316
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
how come I got them all enchanted or how
 

317
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,880
how come I got them all enchanted or how
I've been doing it I've just been doing

318
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:33,890
I've been doing it I've just been doing
 

319
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,430
I've been doing it I've just been doing
level one enchantments on all my iron

wire goes to a redstone torch to invert
 

479
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,100
wire goes to a redstone torch to invert
the signal then branches off to these

480
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,110
the signal then branches off to these
 

481
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,800
the signal then branches off to these
two blocks and there are the sticky

482
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,810
two blocks and there are the sticky
 

483
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,730
two blocks and there are the sticky
pistons directly above so the wire sends

484
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:21,740
pistons directly above so the wire sends
 

485
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,820
pistons directly above so the wire sends
power to the block which powers the

486
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:24,830
power to the block which powers the
 

487
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:32,380
power to the block which powers the
piston above pretty simple got that

488
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,390
piston above pretty simple got that
 

489
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,750
piston above pretty simple got that
there so we can put our water in oh but

490
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:34,760
there so we can put our water in oh but
 

491
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,670
there so we can put our water in oh but
before we do that put glass blocks so we

492
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
before we do that put glass blocks so we
 

493
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,250
before we do that put glass blocks so we
can see our mushrooms and hopefully I

494
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,260
can see our mushrooms and hopefully I
 

495
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,170
can see our mushrooms and hopefully I
got the water streams right otherwise

496
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,180
got the water streams right otherwise
 

497
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,730
got the water streams right otherwise
I'm going to have to redo a lot of this

498
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:50,740
I'm going to have to redo a lot of this
 

499
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,290
I'm going to have to redo a lot of this
but I kind of thought about it before I

500
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:53,300
but I kind of thought about it before I
 

501
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,000
but I kind of thought about it before I
started so it should be okay I'm hoping

502
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,010
started so it should be okay I'm hoping
 

503
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,660
started so it should be okay I'm hoping
so we'll stick one that's fine stick one

504
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:01,670
so we'll stick one that's fine stick one
 

505
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:08,980
so we'll stick one that's fine stick one
there and one over here and it looks

506
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:08,990
there and one over here and it looks
 

507
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,030
there and one over here and it looks
okay

508
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040

 

509
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,970

yeah very nice so they all go to the

510
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:21,980
yeah very nice so they all go to the
 

511
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,560
yeah very nice so they all go to the
center pressure plate holds the water so

512
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,570
center pressure plate holds the water so
 

513
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,769
center pressure plate holds the water so
it doesn't pour everywhere that's very

514
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:29,779
it doesn't pour everywhere that's very
 

515
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:35,680
it doesn't pour everywhere that's very
nice cool

516
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:35,690
nice cool
 

517
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,360
nice cool
very similar to the one we had before

518
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,370
very similar to the one we had before
 

519
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,610
very similar to the one we had before
it's just a little bit bigger and it

520
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:39,620
it's just a little bit bigger and it
 

521
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,530
it's just a little bit bigger and it
does both mushrooms now yeah we can I

522
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:44,540
does both mushrooms now yeah we can I
 

523
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,449
does both mushrooms now yeah we can I
think that's it just fill us in yeah and

524
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:49,459
think that's it just fill us in yeah and
 

525
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,380
think that's it just fill us in yeah and
there's a so one two three four five six

526
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,390
there's a so one two three four five six
 

527
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:00,519
there's a so one two three four five six
seven plus five plus five no plus 4 7

528
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:00,529
seven plus five plus five no plus 4 7
 

529
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,250
seven plus five plus five no plus 4 7
plus 4 11 spots for mushrooms to grow in

530
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,260
plus 4 11 spots for mushrooms to grow in
 

531
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,290
plus 4 11 spots for mushrooms to grow in
here so up to four for each kind will

532
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,300
here so up to four for each kind will
 

533
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,780
here so up to four for each kind will
grow they'll have to fight for these

534
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:10,790
grow they'll have to fight for these
 

535
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:22,020
grow they'll have to fight for these
middle spots but it should work out fine

536
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,030

 

537
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,340

five come on this is one thing I wanted

698
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
five come on this is one thing I wanted
 

699
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:00,020
five come on this is one thing I wanted
to work on the most five yeah it doesn't

700
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,030
to work on the most five yeah it doesn't
 

701
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:09,140
to work on the most five yeah it doesn't
seem to for name for that makes me sad

702
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,150
seem to for name for that makes me sad
 

703
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,580
seem to for name for that makes me sad
makes me very sad okay we got to go find

704
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:13,590
makes me very sad okay we got to go find
 

705
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,740
makes me very sad okay we got to go find
some diamond and I want to try it on

706
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:15,750
some diamond and I want to try it on
 

707
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,920

lapis pretty sure gold won't work I

708
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:18,930
lapis pretty sure gold won't work I
 

709
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,320
lapis pretty sure gold won't work I
think it's the same deal as the iron

710
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,330
think it's the same deal as the iron
 

711
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,270
think it's the same deal as the iron
because if it worked on the iron and the

712
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
because if it worked on the iron and the
 

713
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,730
because if it worked on the iron and the
gold you could duplicate the blocks

714
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:25,740
gold you could duplicate the blocks
 

715
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,480
gold you could duplicate the blocks
replace some duplicate and replace them

716
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:28,490
replace some duplicate and replace them
 

717
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,660
replace some duplicate and replace them
it's only only makes sense it works on

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:32,670
it's only only makes sense it works on
 

719
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,130
it's only only makes sense it works on
blocks that you can't place back down

720
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,140
blocks that you can't place back down
 

721
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,970
blocks that you can't place back down
