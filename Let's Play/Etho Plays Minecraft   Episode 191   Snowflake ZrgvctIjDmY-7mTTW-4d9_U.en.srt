00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
they seem to have trouble crossing the
 

87
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,230
they seem to have trouble crossing the
water

88
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
water
 

89
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,670
water
and i don't want anything to go wrong

90
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
and i don't want anything to go wrong
 

91
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,270
and i don't want anything to go wrong
here

92
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
here
 

93
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,429
here
um so oh yeah i'll show you one thing

94
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
um so oh yeah i'll show you one thing
 

95
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,870

with the slow sand too

96
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
with the slow sand too
 

97
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,789
with the slow sand too
um i talked about maybe putting a slow

98
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
um i talked about maybe putting a slow
 

99
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,389
um i talked about maybe putting a slow
sand down

100
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
sand down
 

101
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,830
sand down
like like here for example

102
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
like like here for example
 

103
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,590
like like here for example
um because the water pushed me slightly

104
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
um because the water pushed me slightly
 

105
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,149
um because the water pushed me slightly
faster than the silverfish can walk

106
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
faster than the silverfish can walk
 

107
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,910
faster than the silverfish can walk
so i thought i might be able to do that

108
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
so i thought i might be able to do that
 

109
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,109
so i thought i might be able to do that
but it does not work

110
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119

 

111
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,190

it slows me down but the problem is

112
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
it slows me down but the problem is
 

113
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,790
it slows me down but the problem is
silver fish is

114
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
silver fish is
 

115
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,910
silver fish is
not slow sand not silver fish

116
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
not slow sand not silver fish
 

117
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,309
not slow sand not silver fish
slow sand is slightly lower than a

118
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
slow sand is slightly lower than a
 

119
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,309
slow sand is slightly lower than a
normal block so you can't go up a half

120
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
normal block so you can't go up a half
 

121
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,710
normal block so you can't go up a half
step

122
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
step
 

123
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,830
step
then so sadly that that idea did not

124
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
then so sadly that that idea did not
 

125
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,150
then so sadly that that idea did not
work

126
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160

 

127
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,910

yeah so we got them up to the surface

128
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
yeah so we got them up to the surface
 

129
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,990
yeah so we got them up to the surface
but we lost a lot of them on the way we

130
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
but we lost a lot of them on the way we
 

131
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,990
but we lost a lot of them on the way we
only got about 50 here

132
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
only got about 50 here
 

133
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,710
only got about 50 here
which is not the greatest rates it's

134
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
which is not the greatest rates it's
 

135
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,270
which is not the greatest rates it's
about 5

136
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
about 5
 

137
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,550

35 or so oh don't go into the water
and that's where we're going where that

192
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
and that's where we're going where that
 

193
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,869
and that's where we're going where that
light is right there

194
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879

 

195
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,910

i lost another one

196
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920

 

197
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,589

we made it guys yay don't die don't die

198
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
we made it guys yay don't die don't die

200
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280

 

201
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,949

what a trip

202
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959

 

203
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,550

i mean we get we got roughly 30 so less

204
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
i mean we get we got roughly 30 so less
 

205
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,629
i mean we get we got roughly 30 so less
than half of what we originally started

206
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
than half of what we originally started
 

207
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,949
than half of what we originally started
with

208
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959

 

209
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,790

not the best rates okay

210
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800

 

211
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,150

let's watch them do their thing

212
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
let's watch them do their thing
 

213
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,230
let's watch them do their thing
and this is all just for fun really

214
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
and this is all just for fun really
 

215
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,870
and this is all just for fun really
so they'll go into the blocks that

216
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
so they'll go into the blocks that
 

217
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,469
so they'll go into the blocks that
renews their health every time they do

218
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
renews their health every time they do
 

219
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,510
renews their health every time they do
that as well um

220
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
that as well um
 

221
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,830
that as well um
and if we could get a lot here we could

222
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
and if we could get a lot here we could
 

223
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,830
and if we could get a lot here we could
have a huge mining army

224
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840

 

225
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,590

all right and all the other guys that

226
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
all right and all the other guys that
 

227
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,830
all right and all the other guys that
didn't make it they despawned because we

228
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
didn't make it they despawned because we
 

229
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,070
didn't make it they despawned because we
went too far away from them

230
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080

 

231
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,189

there we go

232
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
there we go
 

233
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,110
there we go
so you hit them causes them to break the

234
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
so you hit them causes them to break the
 

235
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,870
so you hit them causes them to break the
blocks

236
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880

 

237
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,629

then you pull her back up

238
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639

 

239
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,749

if you can

240
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759

 

241
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,310

they do want to kill me yeah they're not

242
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
they do want to kill me yeah they're not
 

243
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,189
they do want to kill me yeah they're not
going to let me

244
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
going to let me
 

245
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,749
going to let me
there we go and then they'll reenter

246
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
there we go and then they'll reenter
 

247
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,710
there we go and then they'll reenter
blocks

248
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
blocks
 

249
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,550
blocks
but with such a small number it's not

250
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
but with such a small number it's not
 

251
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,950
but with such a small number it's not
going to do do much to the landscape but

252
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
going to do do much to the landscape but
 

253
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,590
going to do do much to the landscape but
if you get hundreds

254
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
if you get hundreds
 

255
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,070
if you get hundreds
it could potentially be a very amazing

256
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
it could potentially be a very amazing
 

257
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,870
it could potentially be a very amazing
digging tool

258
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880

 

259
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,110

oh i'm too close

260
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120

 

261
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,870

but anyway it's an idea i'll keep

262
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
but anyway it's an idea i'll keep
 

263
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,790
but anyway it's an idea i'll keep
working at it and uh

264
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
working at it and uh
 

265
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,790
working at it and uh
we're gonna go do something else now

266
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
we're gonna go do something else now
 

267
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,830
we're gonna go do something else now
let's let's see what i want to do

268
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
let's let's see what i want to do
 

269
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,430
let's let's see what i want to do

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
um let's go
 

271
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,070
um let's go
we're going to work on the nether hub

272
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
we're going to work on the nether hub
 

273
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,870
we're going to work on the nether hub
idea

274
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
idea
 

275
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,150
idea
so we're going to go to the original

276
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
so we're going to go to the original
 

277
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,469
so we're going to go to the original
spawn and we're going to build

278
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
spawn and we're going to build
 

279
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,990
spawn and we're going to build
i want to try to build a garden or

280
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
i want to try to build a garden or

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
something for the portal something
 

283
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,830
something for the portal something
nice looking around it so we'll go do

284
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
nice looking around it so we'll go do
 

285
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,230
nice looking around it so we'll go do
that

286
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
that
 

287
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,629
that
get started

288
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639

 

289
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,350

okay then here we are this is around

290
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
okay then here we are this is around
 

291
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,230
okay then here we are this is around
spawn

292
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
spawn
 

293
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,150
spawn
natural spawn in the world i don't know

294
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
natural spawn in the world i don't know
 

295
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,430
natural spawn in the world i don't know
how this project's going to turn out

296
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
how this project's going to turn out
 

297
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,029
how this project's going to turn out
i've never done anything like this

298
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
i've never done anything like this
 

299
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,870
i've never done anything like this
before

300
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
before
 

301
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,830
before
but i want to have another hub in this

302
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
but i want to have another hub in this
 

303
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,710
but i want to have another hub in this
world to get me around quicker

304
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
world to get me around quicker
 

305
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,629
world to get me around quicker
based off of the one we have on the

306
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
based off of the one we have on the
 

307
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,150
based off of the one we have on the
minecraft server

308
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
minecraft server
 

309
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,510
minecraft server
and the way that works there's a main

310
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
and the way that works there's a main
 

311
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,309
and the way that works there's a main
a main portal in the nether hub and then

312
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
a main portal in the nether hub and then
 

313
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,749
a main portal in the nether hub and then
there's also main portal

314
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
there's also main portal
 

315
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,469
there's also main portal
in the overworld which on the minecraft

316
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
in the overworld which on the minecraft
 

317
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,390
in the overworld which on the minecraft
server is in

318
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
server is in
 

319
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,670
server is in
the the first original spawn city

320
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
the the first original spawn city
 

321
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,150
the the first original spawn city
uh in this world i plan on putting it

322
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
uh in this world i plan on putting it
 

323
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,990
uh in this world i plan on putting it
around here because this is

324
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
around here because this is
 

325
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,870
around here because this is
at natural spawn so that that makes the

326
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
at natural spawn so that that makes the
 

327
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,189
at natural spawn so that that makes the
most sense to me in case

328
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
most sense to me in case
 

329
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,870
most sense to me in case
like if i break my bed and kill myself

330

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
i'll end up here
 

333
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,749
i'll end up here
so i want to be near quick travel

334
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
so i want to be near quick travel
 

335
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,790
so i want to be near quick travel
if that ever happens um

336
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
if that ever happens um
 

337
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,469
if that ever happens um
so i'm going to kill myself just to find

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
so i'm going to kill myself just to find
 

339
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,390
so i'm going to kill myself just to find
the exact location of natural spawn

340
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
the exact location of natural spawn
 

341
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,710
the exact location of natural spawn

we'll
 

395
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,829
we'll
spawn at natural spawn right

396
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

397
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:21,990

there

398
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
there
 

399
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,350
there
okay um

400

401
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,110

let's go back to our chest we'll grab

402
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
let's go back to our chest we'll grab
 

403
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,470
let's go back to our chest we'll grab
some blocks and we'll

404
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
some blocks and we'll
 

405
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,190
some blocks and we'll
mimic having a portal down

406
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
mimic having a portal down
 

407
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,269
mimic having a portal down
and kill ourselves again and see if we

408
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
and kill ourselves again and see if we
 

409
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,230
and kill ourselves again and see if we
end up

410
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
end up
 

411
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,710
end up
there or if it'll put us somewhere else

412
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720

 

413
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,110

okay this is mimicking a quad portal

414
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
okay this is mimicking a quad portal
 

415
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,949
okay this is mimicking a quad portal
imagine there's a portal here

416
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
imagine there's a portal here
 

417
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,110
imagine there's a portal here
here here and here and natural spawn i

418
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
here here and here and natural spawn i
 

419
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,630
here here and here and natural spawn i
think was over here okay

420
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
think was over here okay
 

421
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,949
think was over here okay
uh we're gonna see if we still spawn

422
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
uh we're gonna see if we still spawn
 

423
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,910
uh we're gonna see if we still spawn
there

424
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
there
 

425
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,949
there
now that we have those blocks nearby

426
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959

 

427
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,710

oh come on no

428
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720

 

429
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,150

oh good it's not retaining at least

430
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
oh good it's not retaining at least
 

431
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,350
oh good it's not retaining at least
yes

432
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360

 

433
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,190

nope that did not work okay it moved us

434
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
nope that did not work okay it moved us
 

435
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,389
nope that did not work okay it moved us
um so we won't be able to put a portal

436
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
um so we won't be able to put a portal
 

437
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,910
um so we won't be able to put a portal
directly um

438
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
directly um
 

439
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,150
directly um
in the or we won't have our natural

440
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
in the or we won't have our natural
 

441
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,590
in the or we won't have our natural
spawn rate in the middle that it won't

442
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
spawn rate in the middle that it won't
 

443
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,030
spawn rate in the middle that it won't
let us

444
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
let us
 

445
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,030
let us
which is okay that's okay because i

446
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
which is okay that's okay because i
 

447
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,030
which is okay that's okay because i
don't really want to put the portal

448
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
don't really want to put the portal
 

449
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,550
don't really want to put the portal
so close to my uh mine shaft here either

450
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
so close to my uh mine shaft here either
 

451
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,389
so close to my uh mine shaft here either
for what i haven't for what i have

452
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
for what i haven't for what i have
 

453
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,590
for what i haven't for what i have
planned it's going to take up a lot of

454
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
planned it's going to take up a lot of
 

455
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,990
planned it's going to take up a lot of
space and it will cut into the mountain

456
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
space and it will cut into the mountain
 

457
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,030
space and it will cut into the mountain
if i put it there so maybe we'll just

458
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
if i put it there so maybe we'll just
 

459
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,949
if i put it there so maybe we'll just
have the portal around

460
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
have the portal around
 

461
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,110
have the portal around
here so

462
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120

 

463
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,389

i don't know i'm a little worried about

464
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
i don't know i'm a little worried about
 

465
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,230
i don't know i'm a little worried about
wrecking the natural landscape

466
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
wrecking the natural landscape
 

467
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,470
wrecking the natural landscape
with this project oh

468
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
with this project oh
 

469
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,430
with this project oh
because uh what i did is i looked for a

470
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
because uh what i did is i looked for a
 

471
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,310
because uh what i did is i looked for a
complicate

472
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
complicate
 

473
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,949
complicate
or not complicated but a more complex

474
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
or not complicated but a more complex
 

475
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,430
or not complicated but a more complex
shape

476
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440

 

477
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,230

to do to use for the floor and have the

478
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
to do to use for the floor and have the
 

479
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,990
to do to use for the floor and have the
portal in the middle

480
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
portal in the middle
 

481
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,150
portal in the middle
and i did a search for snowflake

482
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
and i did a search for snowflake
 

483
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,190
and i did a search for snowflake
patterns

484
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
patterns
 

485
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
patterns
and that came up with a lot of really

486
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
and that came up with a lot of really
 

487
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,269
and that came up with a lot of really
cool shapes and i want to put that on

488
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
cool shapes and i want to put that on
 

489
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:21,590
cool shapes and i want to put that on
the

490
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
the
 

491
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,310
the
ground and make make a garden or

492
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
ground and make make a garden or
 

493
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,150
ground and make make a garden or
something in that shape

494
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
something in that shape
 

495
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,829
something in that shape
and have the portal in the middle type

496
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
and have the portal in the middle type
 

497
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,269
and have the portal in the middle type
thing

498
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
thing
 

499
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,150
thing
and when i resize the image it's about

500
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
and when i resize the image it's about
 

501
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,590
and when i resize the image it's about
42 by 42 total

502
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
42 by 42 total
 

503
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,069
42 by 42 total
so if the portals here will go 21 blocks

504
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
so if the portals here will go 21 blocks
 

505
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,670
so if the portals here will go 21 blocks
that way that way

506
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
that way that way
 

507
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,470
that way that way
that way that way type thing

508
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480

 

509
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,269

so this would be a nice central spot but

510
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
so this would be a nice central spot but
 

511
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,710
so this would be a nice central spot but
i

512
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720

 

513
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,470

just don't want to wreck every the

514
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480

spawn
permanently move from doing this

526
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
permanently move from doing this
 

527
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,310
permanently move from doing this
so the ground was up one more two

528
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
so the ground was up one more two
 

529
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,710
so the ground was up one more two
right here

530
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720

 

531
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:30,470

right there so let's kill herself again

532
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480

 

533
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,949

oops sorry tree

534
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959

 

535
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,870

i did bring a bed for a reason now i can

536
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
i did bring a bed for a reason now i can
 

537
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,710
i did bring a bed for a reason now i can
skip the knight while i'm working on

538
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
skip the knight while i'm working on
 

539
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,870
skip the knight while i'm working on
this

540
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
this
 

541
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,509
this
sometimes it gets in the way

542
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519

 

543
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,190

okay will we end up in that square there

544
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
okay will we end up in that square there
 

545
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,750
okay will we end up in that square there
or will we be in a new spot

546
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760

 

547
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,470

we are in the new spot so maybe you can

548
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
we are in the new spot so maybe you can
 

549
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,030
we are in the new spot so maybe you can
actually

550
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
actually
 

551
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,310
actually
move your natural spawn little by little

552
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
move your natural spawn little by little
 

553
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,590
move your natural spawn little by little
by obstructing it

554
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600

 

555
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,030

interesting

556
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040

 

557
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,870

i just had an interesting idea rather

558
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
i just had an interesting idea rather
 

559
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,710
i just had an interesting idea rather
than building my

560
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
than building my
 

561
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,670
than building my
portal area down here and wrecking all

562
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
portal area down here and wrecking all
 

563
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,069
portal area down here and wrecking all
the trees and the natural look

564
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
the trees and the natural look
 

565
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,150
the trees and the natural look
i'm going to build it up in the sky

566
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
i'm going to build it up in the sky
 

567
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,509
i'm going to build it up in the sky
possibly

568
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
possibly
 

569
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,750
possibly
um and then that will give us a nice

570
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
um and then that will give us a nice
 

571
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,190
um and then that will give us a nice
overview area

572
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
overview area
 

573
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,550
overview area
of this cool looking terrain you know

574
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
of this cool looking terrain you know
 

575
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,829
of this cool looking terrain you know
uh and then just have like a boat

576
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
uh and then just have like a boat
 

577
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,150
uh and then just have like a boat
elevator to get up or something

578
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
elevator to get up or something
 

579
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,230
elevator to get up or something
that's that seems like a better idea to

580
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
that's that seems like a better idea to
 

581
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,430
that's that seems like a better idea to
me

582
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
me
 

583
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,310
me
and it will link up to the nether nicer

584
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
and it will link up to the nether nicer
 

585
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,750
and it will link up to the nether nicer
as well it'll probably end up in the

586
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
as well it'll probably end up in the
 

587
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,829
as well it'll probably end up in the
ceiling that way

588
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839

 

589
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,829

so that's the plan i'm fill her up with

590
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
so that's the plan i'm fill her up with
 

591
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,509
so that's the plan i'm fill her up with
leaves

592
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
leaves
 

593
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,590
leaves
and make a portal up in the air and just

594
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
and make a portal up in the air and just
 

595
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,269
and make a portal up in the air and just
see what happens

596
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279

 

597
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,670

with that idea i don't know

598
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680

 

599
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,790

yeah this makes for a great view look at

600
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
yeah this makes for a great view look at
 

601
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,990
yeah this makes for a great view look at
my world

602
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
my world
 

603
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,750
my world
that's awesome so maybe i'll put it

604
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
that's awesome so maybe i'll put it
 

605
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,470
that's awesome so maybe i'll put it
let's go a little higher maybe the view

606
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
let's go a little higher maybe the view
 

607
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,550
let's go a little higher maybe the view
gets better

608
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
gets better
 

609
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,150
gets better
i'm worried about going above the clouds

610
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
i'm worried about going above the clouds
 

611
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,509
i'm worried about going above the clouds
though that you won't be able to see as

612
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
though that you won't be able to see as
 

613
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,870
though that you won't be able to see as
much

614
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880

 

615
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,829

yeah i think i'll do it just below the

616
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

617
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,750

clouds

618
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760

 

619
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,350

pretty cool okay i'll put a portal down

620
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
pretty cool okay i'll put a portal down
 

621
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,829
pretty cool okay i'll put a portal down
and i'll get back to you

622
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839

 

623
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,670

now i believe this portal is going to

624
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
now i believe this portal is going to
 

625
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,990
now i believe this portal is going to
take me to my normal

626
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
take me to my normal
 

627
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,150
take me to my normal
nether portal in order to make it

628
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
nether portal in order to make it
 

629
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,150
nether portal in order to make it
connect to this one i have to build it

630
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
connect to this one i have to build it
 

631
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,150
connect to this one i have to build it
in the nether

632
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
in the nether
 

633
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,710
in the nether
but we'll try it out

634
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720

 

635
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,030

oh no we're somewhere new

636
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040

 

637
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,430

how high up are we why 88 this is a

638
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
how high up are we why 88 this is a
 

639
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,790
how high up are we why 88 this is a
different spot different portal

640
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800

 

641
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,069

it's probably close to the other one

642
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
it's probably close to the other one
 

643
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:23,030
it's probably close to the other one
though

644
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040

 

645
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,910

yeah there's the there's the tree that i

646
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
yeah there's the there's the tree that i
 

647
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,949
yeah there's the there's the tree that i
planted

648
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
planted
 

649
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,189
planted

650
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
there's the other portal right there get
 

651
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,949

673
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,829

okay this is this is working out great i

don't know how the garden idea is going
 

677
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,710
don't know how the garden idea is going
to work out now that it's in the air

678
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
to work out now that it's in the air

that i got off of google images
 

689
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,710
that i got off of google images
and the original wasn't exactly square

690
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
and the original wasn't exactly square
 

691
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,350
and the original wasn't exactly square
either so i'm gonna have to sort of make

692
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
either so i'm gonna have to sort of make
 

693
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,590
either so i'm gonna have to sort of make
this up as i go along

694
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
this up as i go along
 

695
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,949
this up as i go along
actual i think i've heard before that

696
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
actual i think i've heard before that
 

697
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,069
actual i think i've heard before that
snowflake

698
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
snowflake
 

699
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,110
snowflake
patterns are based on fractals

700
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
patterns are based on fractals
 

701
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,350
patterns are based on fractals
i'm not sure if that's true but yeah

702
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
i'm not sure if that's true but yeah
 

703
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,150
i'm not sure if that's true but yeah
there's definite

704
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
there's definite
 

705
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,829
there's definite
definitely some interesting patterns out

706
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
definitely some interesting patterns out
 

707
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,350
definitely some interesting patterns out
there if you

708
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
there if you
 

709
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,110
there if you
are looking for cool patterns to put

710
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
are looking for cool patterns to put
 

711
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,030
are looking for cool patterns to put
into minecraft i would recommend

712
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
into minecraft i would recommend
 

713
00:16:51,040 --> 00:17:00,550
into minecraft i would recommend
checking out snowflakes

714
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560

 

715
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,429

sweet okay

716
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
sweet okay
 

717
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,270
sweet okay
there we go guys that is one quarter of

718
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
there we go guys that is one quarter of
 

719
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,429
there we go guys that is one quarter of
the snowflake complete

720
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
the snowflake complete
 

721
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,429
the snowflake complete
what do you think of it i'm liking the

722
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
what do you think of it i'm liking the
 

723
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,949
what do you think of it i'm liking the
pattern a lot so far it turned out

724
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
pattern a lot so far it turned out
 

725
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,909
pattern a lot so far it turned out
better

726
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
better
 

727
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,710
better
than i was expecting like converting it

728
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
than i was expecting like converting it
 

729
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,029
than i was expecting like converting it
down to minecraft blockiness i think it

730
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
down to minecraft blockiness i think it
 

731
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,990
down to minecraft blockiness i think it
looks good

732
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
looks good
 

733
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,069
looks good
a lot of the finer detail was lost in

734
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
a lot of the finer detail was lost in
 

735
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,949
a lot of the finer detail was lost in
this and i am using my judgment a lot

736
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
this and i am using my judgment a lot
 

737
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,309
this and i am using my judgment a lot
when deciding you know if it's a

738
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
when deciding you know if it's a
 

739
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,750
when deciding you know if it's a
if it's a solid pixel or not because

740
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
if it's a solid pixel or not because
 

741
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,430
if it's a solid pixel or not because
the image i'm looking at has a lot of

742
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
the image i'm looking at has a lot of
 

743
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,669
the image i'm looking at has a lot of
alpha transparency to it

744
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
alpha transparency to it
 

745
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,230
alpha transparency to it
and it's also rotated about five degrees

746
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
and it's also rotated about five degrees
 

747
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,510
and it's also rotated about five degrees
so it's not

748
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
so it's not
 

749
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,110
so it's not
at a right angle and there's a lot of

750
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
at a right angle and there's a lot of
 

751
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,950
at a right angle and there's a lot of
it's not like white and black when i'm

752
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
it's not like white and black when i'm
 

753
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,430
it's not like white and black when i'm
copying it there's a lot of gray to it

754
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
copying it there's a lot of gray to it
 

755
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,190
copying it there's a lot of gray to it
and i have to decide if i should make

756
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
and i have to decide if i should make
 

757
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,630
and i have to decide if i should make
that gray a

758
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
that gray a
 

759
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,590
that gray a
pixel or not and i think it turned out

760
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
pixel or not and i think it turned out
 

761
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,150
pixel or not and i think it turned out
so

762
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
so
 

763
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,190
so
turned out good so far as far as the

764
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
turned out good so far as far as the
 

765
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,789
turned out good so far as far as the
leaves go i don't think we're going to

766
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
leaves go i don't think we're going to
 

767
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,110
leaves go i don't think we're going to
keep

768
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
keep
 

769
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,390
keep
leaves i was originally planning on

770
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
leaves i was originally planning on
 

771
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,070
leaves i was originally planning on
doing a garden theme to this with

772
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
doing a garden theme to this with
 

773
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,870
doing a garden theme to this with
flowers and leaves and grass and

774
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
flowers and leaves and grass and
 

775
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,470
flowers and leaves and grass and
trees maybe but we're doing this up in

776
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
trees maybe but we're doing this up in
 

777
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,230
trees maybe but we're doing this up in
the air now and also

778
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
the air now and also
 

779
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,510
the air now and also
we're in a swamp and all the grass and

780
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
we're in a swamp and all the grass and
 

781
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,710
we're in a swamp and all the grass and
that would be dark green which doesn't

782
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
that would be dark green which doesn't
 

783
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,350
that would be dark green which doesn't
uh you know it doesn't say life like a

784
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
uh you know it doesn't say life like a
 

785
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,230
uh you know it doesn't say life like a
garden does

786
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
garden does
 

787
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,590
garden does
type thing so instead i am

788
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
type thing so instead i am
 

789
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,390
type thing so instead i am
planning to do ice since it's a

790
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
planning to do ice since it's a
 

791
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,510
planning to do ice since it's a
snowflake we should

792
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
snowflake we should
 

793
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,669
snowflake we should
we should build it out of ice i think

794
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
we should build it out of ice i think
 

795
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,750
we should build it out of ice i think
but we'll have to wait till 1.3 to do

796
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
but we'll have to wait till 1.3 to do
 

797
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,549
but we'll have to wait till 1.3 to do
that

798
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
that
 

799
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,750
that
and then i'll come back here and put ice

800
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
and then i'll come back here and put ice
 

801
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,470
and then i'll come back here and put ice
below

802
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
below
 

803
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,150
below
all these leaves and get rid of the

804
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
all these leaves and get rid of the
 

805
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,510
all these leaves and get rid of the
leaves

806
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
leaves
 

807
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,710
leaves
because all we're really doing is

808
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
because all we're really doing is
 

809
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,390
because all we're really doing is
building a platform in the sky

810
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400

 

811
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,190

and that would look pretty good but if

812
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
and that would look pretty good but if
 

813
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,870
and that would look pretty good but if
you have other ideas like

814
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
you have other ideas like
 

815
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,830
you have other ideas like
different blocks or whatever let me know

816
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
different blocks or whatever let me know
 

817
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,830
different blocks or whatever let me know
um

818
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
um
 

819
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,110
um
i'm going to get back to work here

820
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
i'm going to get back to work here
 

821
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,110
i'm going to get back to work here
and i don't know if i said this already

822
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
and i don't know if i said this already
 

823
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,029
and i don't know if i said this already
but instead of copying the image i'm

824
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
but instead of copying the image i'm
 

825
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,070
but instead of copying the image i'm
going from

826
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
going from
 

827
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,470
going from
for the rest of these sections the rest

828
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
for the rest of these sections the rest
 

829
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,549
for the rest of these sections the rest
of the quadrants i'm just going to

830
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
of the quadrants i'm just going to
 

831
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,590
of the quadrants i'm just going to
take a screenshot of this and then

832
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
take a screenshot of this and then
 

833
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,710
take a screenshot of this and then
mirror it to the right

834
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
mirror it to the right
 

835
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,590
mirror it to the right
and to and down and then in that

836
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
and to and down and then in that
 

837
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,590
and to and down and then in that
quadrant over there as well

838
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
quadrant over there as well
 

839
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,870
quadrant over there as well
that way it will be perfectly

840
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
that way it will be perfectly
 

841
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,430
that way it will be perfectly
symmetrical and instead of going by this

842
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
symmetrical and instead of going by this
 

843
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,430
symmetrical and instead of going by this
image which

844
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
image which
 

845
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,549
image which
is not because it's rotated and

846
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
is not because it's rotated and
 

847
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,070
is not because it's rotated and
and resized and up to my judgment type

848
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
and resized and up to my judgment type
 

849
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,789
and resized and up to my judgment type
thing

850
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
thing
 

851
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,870
thing
this this is set in stone if i copy it

852
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
this this is set in stone if i copy it
 

853
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,549
this this is set in stone if i copy it
from this so that's what i'm going to do

854

pushing me to want to improve the
terrain around here some more

864
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
terrain around here some more
 

865
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,710
terrain around here some more

i think that looks really cool that
jungle tree i planted there

872
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
jungle tree i planted there
 

873
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,310
jungle tree i planted there
have a few more of those around would

874
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
have a few more of those around would
 

875
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,549
have a few more of those around would
really spice up the mountain

876
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
really spice up the mountain
 

877
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,430
really spice up the mountain
look and also the swamp i got some

878
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
look and also the swamp i got some
 

879
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,430
look and also the swamp i got some
glowing trees but we could

880
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
glowing trees but we could
 

881
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,789
glowing trees but we could
definitely use a few more

882
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799

 

883
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,549

and deserts uh you can't really do much

884
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
and deserts uh you can't really do much
 

885
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,510
and deserts uh you can't really do much
with deserts

886
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
with deserts
 

887
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,710
with deserts
they just look plain

888
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
they just look plain
 

889
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,390
they just look plain
but i don't know anyway the snowflake is

890
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
but i don't know anyway the snowflake is
 

891
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,190
but i don't know anyway the snowflake is
complete

892
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
complete
 

893
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,789
complete
this is what it looks like from above

894
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
this is what it looks like from above
 

895
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,789
this is what it looks like from above
today we're just doing the shape we're

896
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
today we're just doing the shape we're
 

897
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,870
today we're just doing the shape we're
not we're not completing it

898
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
not we're not completing it
 

899
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,310
not we're not completing it
unfortunately

900
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
unfortunately
 

901
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,390
unfortunately
i would like to but we're going to wait

902
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
i would like to but we're going to wait
 

903
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,470
i would like to but we're going to wait
to 1.3 for the ice i think

904
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
to 1.3 for the ice i think
 

905
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,669
to 1.3 for the ice i think
it's going to look a lot better than

906
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
it's going to look a lot better than
 

907
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,110
it's going to look a lot better than
leaves

908
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120

 

909
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,990

and we should maybe put lighting up here

910
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
and we should maybe put lighting up here
 

911
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,669
and we should maybe put lighting up here
as well if we do ice we'll have to be

912
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
as well if we do ice we'll have to be
 

913
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,149
as well if we do ice we'll have to be
careful

914
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
careful
 

915
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,630
careful
with the lighting um

916
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640

 

917
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,110

but yeah double check the portal make

918
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
but yeah double check the portal make
 

919
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,470
but yeah double check the portal make
sure it still works

920
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
sure it still works
 

921
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,390
sure it still works
and i'll show you from down below from

922
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
and i'll show you from down below from
 

923
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,590
and i'll show you from down below from
down below is where it

924
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
down below is where it
 

925
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,590
down below is where it
really looks cool

926
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
really looks cool
 

927
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,830
really looks cool
portal is good very good

928
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
portal is good very good
 

929
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,909
portal is good very good
and

930
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919

 

931
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,830

okay so in the middle of this portal i

932
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
okay so in the middle of this portal i
 

933
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,430
okay so in the middle of this portal i
put water

934
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
put water
 

935
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,310
put water
it's going to be a way to get up with

936
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
it's going to be a way to get up with
 

937
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,669
it's going to be a way to get up with
boats and also

938
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
boats and also
 

939
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,029
boats and also
safe way to get down for right now

940
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
safe way to get down for right now
 

941
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,149
safe way to get down for right now
anyway

942
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
anyway
 

943
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,190
anyway
um you ready for it

944
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
um you ready for it
 

945
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,789
um you ready for it
you can see i've been i've tested it

946
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
you can see i've been i've tested it
 

947
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,190
you can see i've been i've tested it
already i have some boat debris

948
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
already i have some boat debris
 

949
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,750
already i have some boat debris
here is the snowflake all complete

950
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760

 

951
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,110

and i'm happy with the way it turned out

952
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
and i'm happy with the way it turned out
 

953
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,190
and i'm happy with the way it turned out
very happy i think it looks awesome

954
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
very happy i think it looks awesome
 

955
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,350
very happy i think it looks awesome
there's a few things that are not

956
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
there's a few things that are not
 

957
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,710
there's a few things that are not
quite right about it not that i

958
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
quite right about it not that i
 

959
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,590
quite right about it not that i
think we need to change them and by the

960
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
think we need to change them and by the
 

961
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,950
think we need to change them and by the
way one of the reasons i picked this

962
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
way one of the reasons i picked this
 

963
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,549
way one of the reasons i picked this
snowflake pattern there were

964
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
snowflake pattern there were
 

965
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,070
snowflake pattern there were
there were actually many snowflake

966
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
there were actually many snowflake
 

967
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,310
there were actually many snowflake
patterns i i really liked when i looked

968
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
patterns i i really liked when i looked
 

969
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,350
patterns i i really liked when i looked
for them

970
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
for them
 

971
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,750
for them
i picked this one in particular because

972
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
i picked this one in particular because
 

973
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,669
i picked this one in particular because
we have creeper faces in its

974
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
we have creeper faces in its
 

975
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,149
we have creeper faces in its
sort of eyes and the mouth

976
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
sort of eyes and the mouth
 

977
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,190
sort of eyes and the mouth
six of them or no

978
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
six of them or no
 

979
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,630
six of them or no
one two three yeah six of them uh

980
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
one two three yeah six of them uh
 

981
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,310
one two three yeah six of them uh
but with the way i got the setup i can

982
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
but with the way i got the setup i can
 

983
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,909
but with the way i got the setup i can
tell did not

984
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
tell did not
 

985
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,029
tell did not
do it quite perfect like

986
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
do it quite perfect like
 

987
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,390
do it quite perfect like
if you look from from this one here

988
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
if you look from from this one here
 

989
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,510
if you look from from this one here
the eyes are identical

990
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
the eyes are identical
 

991
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,190
the eyes are identical
and the mouth is identical if you look

992
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
and the mouth is identical if you look
 

993
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,549
and the mouth is identical if you look
on one of these

994
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
on one of these
 

995
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,669
on one of these
diagonal ones not

996
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
diagonal ones not
 

997
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,950
diagonal ones not
not right but

998
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
not right but
 

999
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,590
not right but
i think it looks good could maybe use

1000
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
i think it looks good could maybe use
 

1001
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:39,990
i think it looks good could maybe use
one

1002
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
one
 

1003
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,710
one
leaf block there

1004
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720

 

1005
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,149

but overall it's pretty good especially

1006
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
but overall it's pretty good especially
 

1007
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,950
but overall it's pretty good especially
if he counts

1008
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
if he counts
 

1009
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,669
if he counts
the number of blocks in the eyes like

1010
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
the number of blocks in the eyes like
 

1011
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,029
the number of blocks in the eyes like
that one there

1012
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
that one there
 

1013
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,830
that one there
is two by fours at eight and then

1014
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
is two by fours at eight and then
 

1015
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,909
is two by fours at eight and then
there's two blocks there that's ten

1016
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
there's two blocks there that's ten
 

1017
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,549
there's two blocks there that's ten
and then two by two that's 14 blocks of

1018
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
and then two by two that's 14 blocks of
 

1019
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,990
and then two by two that's 14 blocks of
space

1020
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
space
 

1021
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,909
space
and in this one is three

1022
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
and in this one is three
 

1023
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,190
and in this one is three
and then two by three it's 9

1024
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
and then two by three it's 9
 

1025
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,830
and then two by three it's 9
11. so 14 and that one 11 in that one so

1026
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
11. so 14 and that one 11 in that one so
 

1027
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,590
11. so 14 and that one 11 in that one so
they're not

1028
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
they're not
 

1029
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,310
they're not
identical for sure that's quite a

1030
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
identical for sure that's quite a
 

1031
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,350
identical for sure that's quite a
difference

1032
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
difference
 

1033
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,510
difference
but i think it looks good

1034
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
but i think it looks good
 

1035
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,190
but i think it looks good
and it'll look a lot better when it's

1036
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
and it'll look a lot better when it's
 

1037
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,230
and it'll look a lot better when it's
ice and it the second attempt on this i

1038
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
ice and it the second attempt on this i
 

1039
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,909
ice and it the second attempt on this i
might also try to make a

1040
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
might also try to make a
 

1041
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,990
might also try to make a
three-dimensional look to it so it

1042
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
three-dimensional look to it so it
 

1043
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,110
three-dimensional look to it so it
starts

1044
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
starts
 

1045
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,230
starts
i think it'd look cool if it was sort of

1046
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
i think it'd look cool if it was sort of
 

1047
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,470
i think it'd look cool if it was sort of
cone shape so at the very edges it would

1048
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
cone shape so at the very edges it would
 

1049
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,990
cone shape so at the very edges it would
be one thick and as it

1050
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
be one thick and as it
 

1051
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,909
be one thick and as it
gets towards the middle it gets thicker

1052
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
gets towards the middle it gets thicker
 

1053
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,110
gets towards the middle it gets thicker
and thicker

1054
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
and thicker
 

1055
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,909
and thicker
and then also have ice surrounding this

1056
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
and then also have ice surrounding this
 

1057
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,909
and then also have ice surrounding this
water so we can have a proper

1058
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
water so we can have a proper
 

1059
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,390
water so we can have a proper
boat elevator with walls do uh

1060
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
boat elevator with walls do uh
 

1061
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,830
boat elevator with walls do uh
was it a four by four square tube

1062
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
was it a four by four square tube
 

1063
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,909
was it a four by four square tube
of ice all the way up that would be cool

1064
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
of ice all the way up that would be cool
 

1065
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,269
of ice all the way up that would be cool
with lighting

1066
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
with lighting
 

1067
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,310
with lighting
placed correctly

1068
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320

 

1069
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,190

uh especially if you go out of ways

1070
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
uh especially if you go out of ways
 

1071
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,789
uh especially if you go out of ways
it looks pretty crazy i like that a lot

1072
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799

 

1073
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,110

i think it's cool and we got a great

i think that's cool if you guys have any

1090
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
i think that's cool if you guys have any
 

1091
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:49,909
i think that's cool if you guys have any
ideas on

1092

ideas on
 

1093
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,350
ideas on
improvements let me know um

let's see let's go um
 

1097
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,300
let's see let's go um
just thinking of something i might do

1098
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,310

00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
just wasting time now either do it or
 

1103
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,830
just wasting time now either do it or
don't do it

1104
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
don't do it
 

1105
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,430
don't do it
i'll i'll cut the segment here and try

1106
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
i'll i'll cut the segment here and try
 

1107
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,029
i'll i'll cut the segment here and try
recording another one

1108
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
recording another one
 

1109
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,590
recording another one
and i might toss it or keep it depending

1110
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
and i might toss it or keep it depending
 

1111
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,110
and i might toss it or keep it depending
how it turns out

1112
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120

 

1113
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,230

all right so there's something i want to

1114
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
all right so there's something i want to
 

1115
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,950
all right so there's something i want to

talk to you guys about topic is
seamless textures this is information

1118
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
seamless textures this is information
 

1119
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,269
seamless textures this is information
you might already know but it's

1120
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
you might already know but it's

you might already know but it's
something i found

1122
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
something i found
 

1123
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,390
something i found
very interesting i learned this trick a

1124
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
very interesting i learned this trick a
 

1125
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,669
very interesting i learned this trick a
few years ago

1126
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
few years ago
 

1127
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,990
few years ago
when i was trying to make some tiles for

1128
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
when i was trying to make some tiles for
 

1129
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,549
when i was trying to make some tiles for
a video game

1130
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
a video game
 

1131
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,830
a video game
the problem i was having and i will use

1132
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
the problem i was having and i will use
 

1133
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,549
the problem i was having and i will use
that

1134
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
that
 

1135
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,110
that
is if you try to like say your goal is

1136
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
is if you try to like say your goal is
 

1137
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,830
is if you try to like say your goal is
to make

1138
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
to make
 

1139
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,710
to make
an eight by eight square tile or

1140
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
an eight by eight square tile or
 

1141
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,750
an eight by eight square tile or
something

1142
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
something
 

1143
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,470
something
um you can draw your texture on that

1144
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
um you can draw your texture on that
 

1145
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,070
um you can draw your texture on that
it'll look good and everything

1146
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
it'll look good and everything
 

1147
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,669
it'll look good and everything
but then if you take that eight byte

1148
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
but then if you take that eight byte
 

1149
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,149
but then if you take that eight byte
tile and put it side by side

1150
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
tile and put it side by side
 

1151
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,390
tile and put it side by side
it's not going to join together very

1152
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
it's not going to join together very
 

1153
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,549
it's not going to join together very
well you're going to have a line between

1154
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
well you're going to have a line between
 

1155
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,149
well you're going to have a line between
the 8x8 tiles but with a seamless

1156
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
the 8x8 tiles but with a seamless
 

1157
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:04,950
the 8x8 tiles but with a seamless
texture

1158
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
texture
 

1159
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,669
texture
it seems to they they join together very

1160
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
it seems to they they join together very
 

1161
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,630
it seems to they they join together very
nicely

1162
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
nicely
 

1163
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,710
nicely
and there's a trick to making them

1164
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720

 

1165
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,029

and and the bigger the tile you make the

1166
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
and and the bigger the tile you make the
 

1167
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,750
and and the bigger the tile you make the
more noticeable the line is and also

1168
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
more noticeable the line is and also
 

1169
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,630
more noticeable the line is and also
the more difficult it is to create a

1170
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
the more difficult it is to create a
 

1171
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,149
the more difficult it is to create a
pattern that joins together

1172
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
pattern that joins together
 

1173
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,230
pattern that joins together
so the trick you can

1174
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
so the trick you can
 

1175
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,590
so the trick you can
we're gonna make an eight by eight

1176
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
we're gonna make an eight by eight
 

1177
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,990
we're gonna make an eight by eight
seamless texture here

1178
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
seamless texture here
 

1179
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,310
seamless texture here
to do that you do a four by four

1180
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
to do that you do a four by four
 

1181
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,909
to do that you do a four by four
quadrants

1182
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
quadrants
 

1183
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,830
quadrants
so we can place blocks however we want

1184
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
so we can place blocks however we want
 

1185
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,029
so we can place blocks however we want
here

1186
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039

 

1187
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,950

and obviously when you actually make the

1188
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
and obviously when you actually make the
 

1189
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,990
and obviously when you actually make the
texture you or the

1190
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
texture you or the
 

1191
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,590
texture you or the
the tile pattern you want to try make

1192
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
the tile pattern you want to try make
 

1193
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,110
the tile pattern you want to try make
something that looks good

1194
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
something that looks good
 

1195
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,549
something that looks good
but we're just randomly putting down

1196
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
but we're just randomly putting down
 

1197
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,470
but we're just randomly putting down
blocks in this case okay so there is our

1198
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
blocks in this case okay so there is our
 

1199
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,909
blocks in this case okay so there is our
four by four

1200
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
four by four
 

1201
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,149
four by four
now we can make a seamless texture

1202
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
now we can make a seamless texture
 

1203
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:06,950
now we can make a seamless texture
simply by

1204
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
simply by
 

1205
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,029
simply by
mirroring this seamless eight by eight

1206
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
mirroring this seamless eight by eight
 

1207
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,590
mirroring this seamless eight by eight
texture by mirroring this four by four

1208
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
texture by mirroring this four by four
 

1209
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,909
texture by mirroring this four by four
to the right and to the left so

1210
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919

 

1211
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,990

and this is the same trick i used in

1212
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
and this is the same trick i used in
 

1213
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,350
and this is the same trick i used in
making that

1214
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
making that
 

1215
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,710
making that
that thing up there

1216
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720

 

1217
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,149

even though i wasn't really going for a

1218
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
even though i wasn't really going for a
 

1219
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,750
even though i wasn't really going for a
seamless texture because i don't plan on

1220
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
seamless texture because i don't plan on
 

1221
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,789
seamless texture because i don't plan on
putting

1222
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
putting
 

1223
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,549
putting
those side by side and also that's a

1224
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
those side by side and also that's a
 

1225
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,430
those side by side and also that's a
circle and this works with

1226
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
circle and this works with
 

1227
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,310
circle and this works with
squares and i think rectangles as well

1228
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320

 

1229
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,750

what are we doing here just trying to

1230
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
what are we doing here just trying to
 

1231
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,830
what are we doing here just trying to
copy this

1232
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:46,840

 

1233
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,750

okay

1234
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
okay
 

1235
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,470
okay
just should start with the planks first

1236
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
just should start with the planks first
 

1237
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,070
just should start with the planks first
and i'll continue this and we'll see how

1238
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
and i'll continue this and we'll see how
 

1239
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,950
and i'll continue this and we'll see how
it looks

1240
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960

 

1241
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,950

okay guys so this is the seamless

1242
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
okay guys so this is the seamless
 

1243
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,070
okay guys so this is the seamless
texture we got from that 4x4 pattern

1244
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
texture we got from that 4x4 pattern
 

1245
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,750
texture we got from that 4x4 pattern
i'm going to take this tile and put

1246
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
i'm going to take this tile and put
 

1247
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,510
i'm going to take this tile and put
another one right next to it and we'll

1248
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520
another one right next to it and we'll
 

1249
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,430
another one right next to it and we'll
see how nicely it joins together with

1250
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
see how nicely it joins together with
 

1251
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,669
see how nicely it joins together with
this one

1252
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679

 

1253
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,269

and there we go so that's a really easy

1254
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
and there we go so that's a really easy
 

1255
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,950
and there we go so that's a really easy
way of making an interesting floor

1256
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
way of making an interesting floor
 

1257
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,549
way of making an interesting floor
pattern or whatever you

1258
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
pattern or whatever you
 

1259
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,190
pattern or whatever you
you want to do they join together very

1260
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
you want to do they join together very
 

1261
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,110
you want to do they join together very
nicely that's where the line is right

1262
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
nicely that's where the line is right
 

1263
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,029
nicely that's where the line is right
there

1264
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
there
 

1265
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,549
there
and it works on large scale and with

1266
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
and it works on large scale and with
 

1267
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,590
and it works on large scale and with
many different types of blocks so if you

1268
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
many different types of blocks so if you
 

1269
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,389
many different types of blocks so if you
didn't know that trick i hope you

1270
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
didn't know that trick i hope you
 

1271
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,830
didn't know that trick i hope you
found it interesting at least it's

1272
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
found it interesting at least it's
 

1273
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,430
found it interesting at least it's
pretty pretty basic

1274
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
pretty pretty basic
 

1275
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,549
pretty pretty basic
really um

1276
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
really um
 

1277
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,029
really um
