00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,100
smaller projects today I'm not sure like
there's a lot of little things in our

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,110
there's a lot of little things in our
 

31
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,319
there's a lot of little things in our
world like look at this for example that

32
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:42,329
world like look at this for example that
 

33
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,750
world like look at this for example that
needs some attention we do these big

34
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:44,760
needs some attention we do these big
 

35
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,029
needs some attention we do these big
projects quite often and then there's

36
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
projects quite often and then there's
 

37
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,709
projects quite often and then there's
all these little details that don't get

38
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
all these little details that don't get
 

39
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,549
all these little details that don't get
worked out later because that's just the

40
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
worked out later because that's just the
 

41
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,450
worked out later because that's just the
way I am so maybe we'll tackle a few of

42
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:56,460
way I am so maybe we'll tackle a few of
 

43
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,310
way I am so maybe we'll tackle a few of
those today such as this little issue

44
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
those today such as this little issue
 

45
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,400
those today such as this little issue
here so I've actually been afraid to

46
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,410
here so I've actually been afraid to
 

47
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,900
here so I've actually been afraid to
touch this because as soon as I break

48
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:02,910
touch this because as soon as I break
 

49
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,850
touch this because as soon as I break

53
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,870
chance I mess up somewhere and then

area down there I'm going to leave a
 

83
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,319
area down there I'm going to leave a
fence here so you can view down there so

84
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,329
fence here so you can view down there so
 

85
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,840

that if we ever do add something it

86
00:01:59,840 --> 00:01:59,850
that if we ever do add something it
 

87
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,030
that if we ever do add something it
should look pretty cool and we might add

88
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040
should look pretty cool and we might add
 

89
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,420
should look pretty cool and we might add
like a spiral staircase going down and

90
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,430
like a spiral staircase going down and
 

91
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,059
like a spiral staircase going down and
then to the right here to connect to

92
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:08,069
then to the right here to connect to
 

93
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,460
then to the right here to connect to
that if we if we expand out that way

94
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:10,470
that if we if we expand out that way
 

95
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,369
that if we if we expand out that way
eventually got a fence over here

96
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:13,379
eventually got a fence over here
 

97
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,399
eventually got a fence over here
look down there we should also can we

98
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:18,409
look down there we should also can we
 

99
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,839
look down there we should also can we
protect it a little bit better the

100
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:20,849
protect it a little bit better the
 

101
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,360
protect it a little bit better the
zombie could get over that easy let's

102
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,370
zombie could get over that easy let's
 

103
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,509
zombie could get over that easy let's
make this go up - oh I cannot I cannot

104
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:26,519
make this go up - oh I cannot I cannot
 

105
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:27,770
make this go up - oh I cannot I cannot
aim properly

106
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:27,780
aim properly
 

107
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,099
aim properly
it seems make that go up - there how's

108
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:31,109
it seems make that go up - there how's
 

109
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:37,190
it seems make that go up - there how's
that look sure why not and then let's do

110
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
that look sure why not and then let's do
 

111
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
that look sure why not and then let's do
a little something like that I guess

112
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,310
a little something like that I guess
 

113
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,319
a little something like that I guess
actually let's get rid of this totally

114
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,329
actually let's get rid of this totally
 

115
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,580
actually let's get rid of this totally
huh a little baby zombie will fit

116
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:43,590
huh a little baby zombie will fit
 

117
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,849
huh a little baby zombie will fit
through that no problem okay so I had an

118
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:46,859
through that no problem okay so I had an
 

119
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,640
through that no problem okay so I had an
idea like before we had a fence kind of

120
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:49,650
idea like before we had a fence kind of
 

121
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,439
idea like before we had a fence kind of
blocking zombies from getting into the

122
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:51,449
blocking zombies from getting into the
 

123
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,849
blocking zombies from getting into the
village over here we're going to try to

124
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:52,859
village over here we're going to try to
 

125
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,699
village over here we're going to try to
keep it open like it is right now what

126
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:55,709
keep it open like it is right now what
 

127
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,819
keep it open like it is right now what
I've got is a villager sort of a caught

128
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:58,829
I've got is a villager sort of a caught
 

129
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,259
I've got is a villager sort of a caught
over here and try move him back one more

130
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:02,269
over here and try move him back one more
 

131
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,559
over here and try move him back one more
without killing him uh he's going to be

132
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:06,569
without killing him uh he's going to be
 

133
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,039
without killing him uh he's going to be
like a villager sentry so if a zombie

134
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,049
like a villager sentry so if a zombie
 

135
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,479
like a villager sentry so if a zombie
should ever come down the stairs here

136
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:11,489
should ever come down the stairs here
 

137
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,240
should ever come down the stairs here
which they do occasionally and before

138
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,250
which they do occasionally and before
 

139
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,309
which they do occasionally and before
they reiden call my fence but they've

140
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
they reiden call my fence but they've
 

141
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,960
they reiden call my fence but they've
come down here I think they'll focus on

142
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:17,970
come down here I think they'll focus on
 

143
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,979
come down here I think they'll focus on
this guy first and that should protect

144
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:21,989
this guy first and that should protect
 

145
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,300
this guy first and that should protect
the rest of the villagers because they

146
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,310
the rest of the villagers because they
 

147
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,490
the rest of the villagers because they
won't be able to get them they'll just

148
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,500
won't be able to get them they'll just
 

149
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,640
won't be able to get them they'll just
stare at them and then if we put some

150
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,650
stare at them and then if we put some
 

151
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,189
stare at them and then if we put some
way of killing them like a magma block

152
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:30,199
way of killing them like a magma block
 

153
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,749
way of killing them like a magma block
down below there the other villagers

154
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:32,759
down below there the other villagers
 

155
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,179
down below there the other villagers
shouldn't walk down into here but the

156
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:35,189
shouldn't walk down into here but the
 

157
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,089
shouldn't walk down into here but the
zombies I think will as they try to get

158
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:38,099
zombies I think will as they try to get
 

159
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,270
zombies I think will as they try to get
the villager hopefully that's my thought

160
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
the villager hopefully that's my thought
 

161
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,300
the villager hopefully that's my thought
anyway I'm going to test that out so as

162

247
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,710
decorating and I even did the lighting
here you see I got rid of all the

248
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
here you see I got rid of all the
 

249
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,050
here you see I got rid of all the
torches so we hit lighting in the leaves

250
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
torches so we hit lighting in the leaves
 

251
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,500
torches so we hit lighting in the leaves
here I like to go one block below the

252
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,510
here I like to go one block below the
 

253
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,659
here I like to go one block below the
surface so you can see underneath this

254
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:56,669
surface so you can see underneath this
 

255
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,490
surface so you can see underneath this
leaf block is another leaf block and

256
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
leaf block is another leaf block and
 

257
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,740
leaf block is another leaf block and
then the glowstone I think that hides

258
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:00,750
then the glowstone I think that hides
 

259
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,990
then the glowstone I think that hides
the lighting a lot better otherwise it's

260
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,000
the lighting a lot better otherwise it's
 

261
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,230
the lighting a lot better otherwise it's
it's really easy to see it and as far as

262
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
it's really easy to see it and as far as
 

263
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,379
it's really easy to see it and as far as
this guy goes I'm gonna try it like this

264
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:08,389
this guy goes I'm gonna try it like this
 

265
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,790
this guy goes I'm gonna try it like this
like it seemed like the zombie was going

266
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
like it seemed like the zombie was going
 

267
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,710
like it seemed like the zombie was going
after him and then he saw me when I was

268
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
after him and then he saw me when I was
 

269
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,719
after him and then he saw me when I was
over there and then he switched targets

270
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:14,729
over there and then he switched targets
 

271
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,350
over there and then he switched targets
umm yeah we'll try it like this

272
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,360
umm yeah we'll try it like this
 

273
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,900
umm yeah we'll try it like this
and if I come back one day and all the

274
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:20,910
and if I come back one day and all the
 

275
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,600
and if I come back one day and all the
villagers are dead well then it's pretty

276
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,610
villagers are dead well then it's pretty
 

277
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,190
villagers are dead well then it's pretty
obvious it doesn't work like I want it

278
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,200
obvious it doesn't work like I want it
 

279
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,080
obvious it doesn't work like I want it
to and then we will have a problem but

280
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,090
to and then we will have a problem but
 

281
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,120
to and then we will have a problem but
yeah anyways so I think this looks

282
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,130
yeah anyways so I think this looks
 

283
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,040
yeah anyways so I think this looks
pretty decent to some random logs and

284
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,050
pretty decent to some random logs and
 

285
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,100
pretty decent to some random logs and
leaves and stuff I decided to use red

286
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,110
leaves and stuff I decided to use red
 

287
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,219
leaves and stuff I decided to use red
brick here for like the structural stuff

288
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:40,229
brick here for like the structural stuff
 

289
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:40,940
brick here for like the structural stuff
and he

290
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:40,950
and he
 

291
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,950
and he
the village here this used to be stone

292
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
the village here this used to be stone
 

293
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,660
the village here this used to be stone
brick I switched over to red brick just

294
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:44,670
brick I switched over to red brick just
 

295
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,510
brick I switched over to red brick just
that more color I think it looks good

296
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
that more color I think it looks good
 

297
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,900
that more color I think it looks good
and we will move on now to something

298
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:50,910
and we will move on now to something
 

299
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,640
and we will move on now to something
else let's do another little project oh

300
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,650
else let's do another little project oh
 

301
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,550

yeah they were they were getting back

302
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
yeah they were they were getting back
 

303
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,810
yeah they were they were getting back

00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,820
like they were standing on the stone
 

305
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,880
like they were standing on the stone
block and then on the fence and then

306
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:58,890
block and then on the fence and then
 

307
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,410
block and then on the fence and then
falling here so I added one more fence

308
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:03,420
falling here so I added one more fence
 

309
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,850
falling here so I added one more fence
to hopefully stop there pathfinding from

310
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:07,860
to hopefully stop there pathfinding from
 

311
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,650
to hopefully stop there pathfinding from
doing that and if they try to walk here

312
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:09,660
doing that and if they try to walk here
 

313
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,590
doing that and if they try to walk here

for let's see how this would look you do

354
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
for let's see how this would look you do
 

355
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,840
for let's see how this would look you do
yeah I think that'll be okay and can we

356
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:14,850
yeah I think that'll be okay and can we
 

357
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,510
yeah I think that'll be okay and can we
hide lighting here is my question so if

358
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
hide lighting here is my question so if
 

359
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,020
hide lighting here is my question so if
we put it like a sea lantern red glass

360
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,030
we put it like a sea lantern red glass
 

361
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,940

does that blend in enough yeah I think

362
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:25,950

have to get this wire to connect up over
 

477
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,999
have to get this wire to connect up over
to there I ran a wire to his sickness

478
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:58,009
to there I ran a wire to his sickness
 

479
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,650
to there I ran a wire to his sickness
control and that's that's where we got

480
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:00,660
control and that's that's where we got
 

481
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,790
control and that's that's where we got
to get to here okay so the wiring is a

482
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
to get to here okay so the wiring is a
 

483
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,769
to get to here okay so the wiring is a
little bit on the messy side here but

484
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:06,779
little bit on the messy side here but
 

485
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,689
little bit on the messy side here but
it's the only way

486
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:07,699
it's the only way
 

487
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,449
it's the only way
going to work basically it goes from

488
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:10,459
going to work basically it goes from
 

489
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,689
going to work basically it goes from
here from the garbage detection and goes

490
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:13,699
here from the garbage detection and goes
 

491
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,479
here from the garbage detection and goes
up here up a staircase and let's enter

492
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:16,489
up here up a staircase and let's enter
 

493
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:20,590
up here up a staircase and let's enter
Perl up to that other spots and get its

494
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:20,600
Perl up to that other spots and get its
 

495
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,559
Perl up to that other spots and get its
old just cleared it's sweet yeah so the

496
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:23,569
old just cleared it's sweet yeah so the
 

497
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,489
old just cleared it's sweet yeah so the
thumbs up here then up over to here so

498
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:27,499
thumbs up here then up over to here so
 

499
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,949
thumbs up here then up over to here so
it merges together with this thing this

500
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:29,959
it merges together with this thing this
 

501
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,319
it merges together with this thing this
is what randomly controls when Wilson

502
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:32,329
is what randomly controls when Wilson
 

503
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:34,299
is what randomly controls when Wilson
gets six so based on his health the

504
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:34,309
gets six so based on his health the
 

505
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:36,189
gets six so based on his health the
lower that his health is the more likely

506
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:36,199
lower that his health is the more likely
 

507
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:39,759
lower that his health is the more likely
he is to get sick and now he's got two

508
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:39,769
he is to get sick and now he's got two
 

509
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,590
he is to get sick and now he's got two
methods of getting sick because they

510
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
methods of getting sick because they
 

511
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,079
methods of getting sick because they
both joined together here and basically

512
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,089
both joined together here and basically
 

513
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:46,030
both joined together here and basically
if the redstone block is over here this

514
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,040
if the redstone block is over here this
 

515
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,289
if the redstone block is over here this
is an RS nor latch then he is not sick

516
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:50,299
is an RS nor latch then he is not sick
 

517
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:53,169
is an RS nor latch then he is not sick
and if it's over there he is sick so

518
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:53,179
and if it's over there he is sick so
 

519
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,179
and if it's over there he is sick so
this this pushes that redstone block

520
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:55,189
this this pushes that redstone block
 

521
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:59,919
this this pushes that redstone block
over it's pretty simple um yeah so let's

522
00:11:59,919 --> 00:11:59,929
over it's pretty simple um yeah so let's
 

523
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,389
over it's pretty simple um yeah so let's
go check it out

524
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
go check it out
 

525
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,539
go check it out
I fired up Wilson he's running right now

526
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:03,549
I fired up Wilson he's running right now
 

527
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:07,689
I fired up Wilson he's running right now
I'm some testing on him and yeah he's in

528
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:07,699
I'm some testing on him and yeah he's in
 

529
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:12,639
I'm some testing on him and yeah he's in
a happy mood still very good so let's do

me do get stuck here somewhere oh it did
darn it mmm I picked up the grass block

540
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:39,109
darn it mmm I picked up the grass block
 

541
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,199
darn it mmm I picked up the grass block
so I think it's sent through some for

542
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:41,209
so I think it's sent through some for
 

543
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,069
so I think it's sent through some for
some reason there Oh

545
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,939

so y-yeah so that aligns it to this edge

546
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:48,949
so y-yeah so that aligns it to this edge
 

547
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:54,009
so y-yeah so that aligns it to this edge
oh I think it worked that time I heard

lights ideally but yeah we're gonna move

598
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,720
lights ideally but yeah we're gonna move
 

599
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,299
lights ideally but yeah we're gonna move
on to another project now Oh a long time

600
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:10,309
on to another project now Oh a long time
 

601
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,189
on to another project now Oh a long time
ago actually let's go check this out

602
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:12,199
ago actually let's go check this out
 

603
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,929
ago actually let's go check this out
first

604
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:13,939
first
 

605
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,389
first
we built this firework machine which is

606
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
we built this firework machine which is
 

607
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,479
we built this firework machine which is
actually a really neat thing I almost

608
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:19,489
actually a really neat thing I almost
 

609
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:20,919
actually a really neat thing I almost
want to make another one of these more

610
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:20,929
want to make another one of these more
 

611
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,319
want to make another one of these more
complicated but we never even got this

612
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:23,329
complicated but we never even got this
 

613
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,879
complicated but we never even got this
first one working the way I want it to

614
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:24,889
first one working the way I want it to
 

615
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,729
first one working the way I want it to
so let's let's finish it off here today

616
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:27,739
so let's let's finish it off here today
 

617
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:31,869
so let's let's finish it off here today
if we can but basically we have a

618
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:31,879
if we can but basically we have a
 

619
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,049
if we can but basically we have a
randomizer that we just saw there and if

620
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:35,059
randomizer that we just saw there and if
 

621
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,119
randomizer that we just saw there and if
we stand underneath the dropzone here

622
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,129
we stand underneath the dropzone here
 

623
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,059
we stand underneath the dropzone here
let's unload a few items as well before

624
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,069
let's unload a few items as well before
 

625
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,400
let's unload a few items as well before
we do this because I think it gives us a

626
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,410
we do this because I think it gives us a
 

627
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,009
we do this because I think it gives us a
lot of stuff yeah stand underneath here

628
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,019
lot of stuff yeah stand underneath here
 

629
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,720
lot of stuff yeah stand underneath here
to get it going you just press the

630
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:46,730
to get it going you just press the
 

631
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,169
to get it going you just press the
button here and it randomly dispenses

632
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:50,179
button here and it randomly dispenses
 

633
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,449
button here and it randomly dispenses
various ingredients to make a firework

634
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:52,459
various ingredients to make a firework
 

635
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,799
various ingredients to make a firework
star here so different colors different

636
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:55,809
star here so different colors different
 

637
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,299
star here so different colors different
modifiers and ideas you keep your hotbar

638
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:58,309
modifiers and ideas you keep your hotbar
 

639
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,779
modifiers and ideas you keep your hotbar
clean here so then it you add them all

640
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:01,789
clean here so then it you add them all
 

641
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:03,519
clean here so then it you add them all
together you get your fireworks start

642
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:03,529
together you get your fireworks start
 

643
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,299
together you get your fireworks start
you throw it into the hopper randomly

644
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:07,309
you throw it into the hopper randomly
 

645
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,859
you throw it into the hopper randomly
gives you more ingredients and you just

646
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:08,869
gives you more ingredients and you just
 

647
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,469
gives you more ingredients and you just
keep doing the same thing oh I forgot to

648
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:11,479
keep doing the same thing oh I forgot to
 

649
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:17,199
keep doing the same thing oh I forgot to
use it green uh-huh so that works really

650
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,209
use it green uh-huh so that works really
 

651
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,079
use it green uh-huh so that works really
good actually I'm happy with that but we

652
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,089
good actually I'm happy with that but we
 

653
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,720
good actually I'm happy with that but we
never okay I'm going to stop doing it

654
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:22,730
never okay I'm going to stop doing it
 

655
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,509
never okay I'm going to stop doing it
now we never finished the second part of

656
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
now we never finished the second part of
 

657
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,080
now we never finished the second part of
this

658
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,090
this
 

659
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,910
this
because once you get the firework star

660
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
because once you get the firework star
 

661
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,440
because once you get the firework star
that is not the only part of making

662
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,450
that is not the only part of making
 

663
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,190
that is not the only part of making
fireworks you then take the star and you

664
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,200
fireworks you then take the star and you
 

665
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,750
fireworks you then take the star and you
have to combine it with paper and

666
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
have to combine it with paper and
 

667
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,400
have to combine it with paper and
gunpowder - to make the firework now so

668
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,410
gunpowder - to make the firework now so
 

669
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,640
gunpowder - to make the firework now so
it's one vapor one firework star and

670
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:45,650
it's one vapor one firework star and
 

671
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,700
it's one vapor one firework star and
either one two or three gunpowder the

672
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:48,710
either one two or three gunpowder the
 

673
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,650
either one two or three gunpowder the
more gunpowder you add the farther it

674
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:50,660
more gunpowder you add the farther it
 

675
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,830
more gunpowder you add the farther it
will fly up in the sky and it's a good

676
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:53,840
will fly up in the sky and it's a good
 

677
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,600
will fly up in the sky and it's a good
thing we never did finish this because I

678
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,610
thing we never did finish this because I
 

679
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,680
thing we never did finish this because I
don't know if you guys know this but

680
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:56,690
don't know if you guys know this but
 

681
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,170
don't know if you guys know this but
they actually changed it recently where

682
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,180
they actually changed it recently where
 

683
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,120
they actually changed it recently where
you get three fireworks instead of just

684
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,130
you get three fireworks instead of just
 

685
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,250
you get three fireworks instead of just
one three four one amazing value so if

686
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,260
one three four one amazing value so if
 

687
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,990
one three four one amazing value so if
we built this previously it probably

688
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
we built this previously it probably
 

689
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,750
we built this previously it probably
wouldn't work today

690
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:09,760
wouldn't work today
 

691
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,870
wouldn't work today
aha actually just the wait a second here

692
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:13,880
aha actually just the wait a second here
 

693
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,640
aha actually just the wait a second here
I forgot you can actually combine more

694
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:15,650
I forgot you can actually combine more
 

695
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,830
I forgot you can actually combine more
than one fireworks start together can't

696
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:17,840
than one fireworks start together can't
 

697
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,100
than one fireworks start together can't
you let's just double-check that or am i

698
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,110
you let's just double-check that or am i
 

699
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,440
you let's just double-check that or am i
imagining that no you can have more than

700
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,450
imagining that no you can have more than
 

701
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,050
imagining that no you can have more than
one you can have up to five maybe more

702
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,060
one you can have up to five maybe more
 

703
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,030
one you can have up to five maybe more
fewer than gunpowder oh you can oh man

704
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
fewer than gunpowder oh you can oh man
 

705
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,980
fewer than gunpowder oh you can oh man
seven stars I remember what that does

706
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:34,990
seven stars I remember what that does
 

707
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,110
seven stars I remember what that does
does it make seven explosions oh it does

708
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,120
does it make seven explosions oh it does
 

709
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,070
does it make seven explosions oh it does
oh alright

710
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,080
oh alright
 

711
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,810
oh alright
that is a little crazy isn't it um that

712
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:49,820
that is a little crazy isn't it um that
 

713
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,170
that is a little crazy isn't it um that
kind of changes my plan here alright I

714
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,180
kind of changes my plan here alright I
 

715
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,970
kind of changes my plan here alright I
think what we'll do I was going to have

716
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:57,980
think what we'll do I was going to have
 

717
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,070
think what we'll do I was going to have
three controls if this like we're

718
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,080
three controls if this like we're
 

719
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,200
three controls if this like we're
guaranteed we need one gunpowder at

720
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,210
guaranteed we need one gunpowder at
 

721
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,720
guaranteed we need one gunpowder at
least to make the fire work right it's

722
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:04,730
least to make the fire work right it's
 

723
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,240
least to make the fire work right it's
going to do it so that if this is down

724
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,250
going to do it so that if this is down
 

725
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,920
going to do it so that if this is down
then you get due to gun powder if it's

726
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:08,930
then you get due to gun powder if it's
 

727
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,590
then you get due to gun powder if it's
down you get three gunpowder or if this

728
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
down you get three gunpowder or if this
 

729
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,030
down you get three gunpowder or if this
is up and this is down you only get two

730
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,040
is up and this is down you only get two
 

731
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,800
is up and this is down you only get two
and then this is going to be a

732
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:14,810
and then this is going to be a
 

733
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,130
and then this is going to be a
randomizer option so between one and

734
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,140
randomizer option so between one and
 

735
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,120
randomizer option so between one and
three gunpowder if that's down and I

736
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,130
three gunpowder if that's down and I
 

737
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,860
three gunpowder if that's down and I
guess maybe will randomize how many

738
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:23,870
guess maybe will randomize how many
 

739
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,720
guess maybe will randomize how many
stars we get to mmm like we don't have a

740
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:28,730
stars we get to mmm like we don't have a
 

741
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,980
stars we get to mmm like we don't have a
lot of space to build this honestly um

742
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:31,990
lot of space to build this honestly um
 

743
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,470
lot of space to build this honestly um
yes let me prepare this area and then

744
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,480
yes let me prepare this area and then
 

745
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,310
yes let me prepare this area and then
we'll figure out what we're doing

746
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
we'll figure out what we're doing
 

747
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,620
we'll figure out what we're doing
exactly what's behind here like how much

748
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,630
exactly what's behind here like how much
 

749
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,770
exactly what's behind here like how much
space

750
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:39,780
space
 

751
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,750
space
looks like this face oh did I break

752
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:44,760
looks like this face oh did I break
 

753
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,760
looks like this face oh did I break
something but what is back here oh I

754
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:49,770
something but what is back here oh I
 

755
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,430
something but what is back here oh I
broke something now that's the thing

756
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,440
broke something now that's the thing
 

757
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,200
broke something now that's the thing
about working around the man tube

758
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,210
about working around the man tube
 

759
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,350
about working around the man tube
there's always redstone like everywhere

760
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
there's always redstone like everywhere
 

761
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,340
there's always redstone like everywhere
if it be so careful you know this is

762
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,350
if it be so careful you know this is
 

763
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,899
if it be so careful you know this is
actually a really good opportunity here

764
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:02,909
actually a really good opportunity here
 

765
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,460
actually a really good opportunity here
for me to step outside of my comfort

766
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,470
for me to step outside of my comfort
 

767
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,250
for me to step outside of my comfort
zone with redstone like I I have a

768
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,260
zone with redstone like I I have a
 

769
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,110
zone with redstone like I I have a
certain number of circuits I use all the

770
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
certain number of circuits I use all the
 

771
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,140
certain number of circuits I use all the
time and I don't like diverge from that

772
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,150
time and I don't like diverge from that
 

773
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,740
time and I don't like diverge from that
too often something I very rarely use is

774
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:15,750
too often something I very rarely use is
 

775
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,100
too often something I very rarely use is
these item frames actually so this is a

776
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,110
these item frames actually so this is a
 

777
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,770
these item frames actually so this is a
good good place to use it I would I

778
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:21,780
good good place to use it I would I
 

779
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,950
good good place to use it I would I
would think because you could have one

780
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
would think because you could have one
 

781
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,840
would think because you could have one
star two stars three stars four stars

782
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:26,850
star two stars three stars four stars
 

783
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,820
star two stars three stars four stars
five stars six or seven stars eight

784
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:28,830
five stars six or seven stars eight
 

785
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,649
five stars six or seven stars eight
stars you have a nice selector panel

786
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:30,659
stars you have a nice selector panel
 

787
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,490
stars you have a nice selector panel
that way and depending on how that's

788
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,500
that way and depending on how that's
 

789
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,710
that way and depending on how that's
rotated it affects how far the signal

790
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
rotated it affects how far the signal
 

791
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,610
rotated it affects how far the signal
goes here so two three four five six

792
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,620
goes here so two three four five six
 

793
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,610
goes here so two three four five six
seven eight back to one

794
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:42,620
seven eight back to one
 

795
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,980
seven eight back to one
alright so somehow we need to make a

796
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:45,990
alright so somehow we need to make a
 

797
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,640
alright so somehow we need to make a
circuit here so that's if it's that one

798
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:49,650
circuit here so that's if it's that one
 

799
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,620
circuit here so that's if it's that one
it shoots one item out of the dropper if

800
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:51,630
it shoots one item out of the dropper if
 

801
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,630
it shoots one item out of the dropper if
it's a two it shoots two stars three

802
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
it's a two it shoots two stars three
 

803
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,080
it's a two it shoots two stars three
three stars how do we do that I'm not

804
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,090
three stars how do we do that I'm not
 

805
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,520
three stars how do we do that I'm not
sure I'll try figure it out awesome so I

806
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,530
sure I'll try figure it out awesome so I
 

807
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,200
sure I'll try figure it out awesome so I
got it figured out here guys and it's

808
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,210
got it figured out here guys and it's
 

809
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,549
got it figured out here guys and it's
actually fairly simple you can see the

810
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
actually fairly simple you can see the
 

811
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,169
actually fairly simple you can see the
whole thing flat out on the ground here

812
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:06,179
whole thing flat out on the ground here
 

813
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,289
whole thing flat out on the ground here
not really much - it's the key to this

814
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:09,299
not really much - it's the key to this
 

815
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,100
not really much - it's the key to this
is the comparator clock so depending on

816
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,110
is the comparator clock so depending on
 

817
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,320
is the comparator clock so depending on
how long night it's powered for its

818
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,330
how long night it's powered for its
 

819
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,750
how long night it's powered for its
affects how my items get shot out right

820
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
affects how my items get shot out right
 

821
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,440
affects how my items get shot out right
so all you got to do is make it stay

822
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,450
so all you got to do is make it stay
 

823
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,330
so all you got to do is make it stay
powered longer the further out the

824
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,340
powered longer the further out the
 

825
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,279
powered longer the further out the
signal goes here and you can do that

826
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:25,289
signal goes here and you can do that
 

827
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,810
signal goes here and you can do that
just by adding more and more repeaters

828
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820
just by adding more and more repeaters
 

829
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,200
just by adding more and more repeaters
as it goes on further so I want this

830
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,210
as it goes on further so I want this
 

831
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,240
as it goes on further so I want this
activate by a pulse like by a button

832
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,250
activate by a pulse like by a button
 

833
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,690
activate by a pulse like by a button
press sort of thing and that makes this

834
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:35,700
press sort of thing and that makes this
 

835
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,320
press sort of thing and that makes this
piston extend okay let's just break this

836
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,330
piston extend okay let's just break this
 

837
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,990
piston extend okay let's just break this
right now

838
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,000
right now
 

839
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,180
right now
they it makes piston extend for a short

840
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,190
they it makes piston extend for a short
 

841
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,770
they it makes piston extend for a short
amount of time and then retracts I got a

842
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:44,780
amount of time and then retracts I got a
 

843
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,289
amount of time and then retracts I got a
monostable circuit here so it doesn't

844
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:47,299
monostable circuit here so it doesn't
 

845
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,940
monostable circuit here so it doesn't
state it stay out for very long and

846
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:50,950
state it stay out for very long and
 

847
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,830
state it stay out for very long and
basically this is sending out the signal

848
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
basically this is sending out the signal
 

849
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,450
basically this is sending out the signal
here so every time the block goes in

850
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:55,460
here so every time the block goes in
 

851
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,970
here so every time the block goes in
front it sends out a pulse to all these

852
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:57,980
front it sends out a pulse to all these
 

853
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,700
front it sends out a pulse to all these
repeaters so let's let's give it a try

854
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:00,710
repeaters so let's let's give it a try
 

855
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,409
repeaters so let's let's give it a try
here so this is one and it shot out one

856
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:04,419
here so this is one and it shot out one
 

857
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:11,020
here so this is one and it shot out one
very cool this is two one two three oh I

858
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,030
very cool this is two one two three oh I
 

859
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,230
very cool this is two one two three oh I
didn't switch it i right-clicked if i

860
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
didn't switch it i right-clicked if i
 

861
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,529
didn't switch it i right-clicked if i
didn't work we've got three that time

862
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:16,539
didn't work we've got three that time
 

863
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,750
didn't work we've got three that time
four one two three four five and you get

864
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:22,760
four one two three four five and you get
 

865
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,270
four one two three four five and you get
the point one two three four five so I

866
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
the point one two three four five so I
 

867
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,940
the point one two three four five so I
don't think I need to go beyond five I

868
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:27,950
don't think I need to go beyond five I
 

869
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,890
don't think I need to go beyond five I
don't want more than five five firework

870
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:29,900
don't want more than five five firework
 

871
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,230
don't want more than five five firework
stars that's hard to say so this is

872
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
stars that's hard to say so this is
 

873
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,620
stars that's hard to say so this is
eight seven six so up to five is only

874
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:38,630
eight seven six so up to five is only
 

875
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,000
eight seven six so up to five is only
this big so it's gonna be a pretty small

876
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,010
this big so it's gonna be a pretty small
 

877
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:46,299
this big so it's gonna be a pretty small
circuit really okay guys so it's

878
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:46,309
circuit really okay guys so it's
 

879
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,830
circuit really okay guys so it's
probably been about an hour now I've

880
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
probably been about an hour now I've
 

881
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
probably been about an hour now I've
been setting this up and seemed like a

882
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,090
been setting this up and seemed like a
 

883
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,610
been setting this up and seemed like a
simple idea but it's gotten a little bit

884
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:51,620
simple idea but it's gotten a little bit
 

885
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,390
simple idea but it's gotten a little bit
crazy but it's just about at the point

886
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:55,400
crazy but it's just about at the point
 

887
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,279
crazy but it's just about at the point
where we can try it out here so I got

888
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:57,289
where we can try it out here so I got
 

889
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,070
where we can try it out here so I got
rid of the whole random idea just

890
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
rid of the whole random idea just
 

891
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,450
rid of the whole random idea just
because we don't really have the space

892
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,460
because we don't really have the space
 

893
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,510
because we don't really have the space
here I ran into three projects three

894
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:04,520
here I ran into three projects three
 

895
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,159
here I ran into three projects three
redstone projects while building this

896
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,169
redstone projects while building this
 

897
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,140
redstone projects while building this
there's something over here

898
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,150
there's something over here
 

899
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,799
there's something over here
there was a door over there and also a

900
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:10,809
there was a door over there and also a
 

901
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,710
there was a door over there and also a
wheat farm my mini farm is right over

902
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
wheat farm my mini farm is right over
 

903
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,700
wheat farm my mini farm is right over
there so yeah I decided just to get rid

904
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,710
there so yeah I decided just to get rid
 

905
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,770
there so yeah I decided just to get rid
of the random aspect of the whole

906
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:20,780
of the random aspect of the whole
 

907
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,330
of the random aspect of the whole
control panel here because that would

908
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,340
control panel here because that would
 

909
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,960
control panel here because that would
add a lot more to it so basically that's

910
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:25,970
add a lot more to it so basically that's
 

911
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,210
add a lot more to it so basically that's
down it adds an extra gunpowder that's

912
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,220
down it adds an extra gunpowder that's
 

913
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,450
down it adds an extra gunpowder that's
down adds an extra gunpowder so both are

914
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:31,460
down adds an extra gunpowder so both are
 

915
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,409
down adds an extra gunpowder so both are
down that adds three in total and then

916
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:35,419
down that adds three in total and then
 

917
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,630
down that adds three in total and then
this is our selector for how many

918
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:37,640
this is our selector for how many
 

919
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,210
this is our selector for how many
firework stars we want to include in our

920
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,220
firework stars we want to include in our
 

921
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,840
firework stars we want to include in our
recipe

922
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,850
recipe
 

923
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,549
recipe
so we're basically choosing everything

924
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
so we're basically choosing everything
 

925
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,350
so we're basically choosing everything
here and there's five to five droppers

926
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
here and there's five to five droppers
 

927
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,570
here and there's five to five droppers
not dispensers so one of them is going

928
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:49,580
not dispensers so one of them is going
 

929
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,120
not dispensers so one of them is going
to have gunpowder in that always gets

930
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,130
to have gunpowder in that always gets
 

931
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,160
to have gunpowder in that always gets
dispensed these two

932
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,170
dispensed these two
 

933
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,620
dispensed these two
it's optional and then these are our

934
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:56,630
it's optional and then these are our
 

935
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,330
it's optional and then these are our
fireworks stars and that one and the

936
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,340
fireworks stars and that one and the
 

937
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,800
fireworks stars and that one and the
paper and this one just going to

938
00:21:59,800 --> 00:21:59,810
paper and this one just going to
 

939
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,420
paper and this one just going to
manually refill these because it'll

940
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,430
manually refill these because it'll
 

941
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,720
manually refill these because it'll
probably last quite a while and to get

942
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:04,730
probably last quite a while and to get
 

943
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,400
probably last quite a while and to get
those to us I was going to set up a

944
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,410
those to us I was going to set up a
 

945
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,520
those to us I was going to set up a
water stream here probably and see when

946
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,530
water stream here probably and see when
 

947
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,100
water stream here probably and see when
I flip the lever makes the piston extend

948
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,110
I flip the lever makes the piston extend
 

949
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,310
I flip the lever makes the piston extend
over there same ones over there

950
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,320
over there same ones over there
 

951
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,230
over there same ones over there
so basically if it's extended the block

952
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
so basically if it's extended the block
 

953
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,540
so basically if it's extended the block
is forward here and then the repeaters

954
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,550
is forward here and then the repeaters
 

955
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,430
is forward here and then the repeaters
can set send the signal into the block

956
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,440
can set send the signal into the block
 

957
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,560
can set send the signal into the block
and up into the droppers here is how

958
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,570
and up into the droppers here is how
 

959
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,520
and up into the droppers here is how
that works and a lot of this is kind of

960
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:30,530
that works and a lot of this is kind of
 

961
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,380
that works and a lot of this is kind of
crazy this is the yeah this is a

962
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,390
crazy this is the yeah this is a
 

963
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,390
crazy this is the yeah this is a
selector thing with item frame that we

964
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,400
selector thing with item frame that we
 

965
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,430
selector thing with item frame that we
saw before it's kind of messed up

966
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
saw before it's kind of messed up
 

967
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,100
saw before it's kind of messed up
looking as I tried to make it fit here

968
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,110
looking as I tried to make it fit here
 

969
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,680
looking as I tried to make it fit here
and yeah this probably looks like a

970
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:47,690
and yeah this probably looks like a
 

971
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,390
and yeah this probably looks like a
jumbled mess that's basically what it is

972
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:49,400
jumbled mess that's basically what it is
 

973
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,250
jumbled mess that's basically what it is
it's a little hard to see anything

974
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,260
it's a little hard to see anything
 

975
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,430
it's a little hard to see anything
specific here same kind of deal we did

976
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:54,440
specific here same kind of deal we did
 

977
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,290
specific here same kind of deal we did
over there got a button to start it and

978
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,300
over there got a button to start it and
 

979
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,510
over there got a button to start it and
as we throw the fireworks into the

980
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:58,520
as we throw the fireworks into the
 

981
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,270
as we throw the fireworks into the
hopper it should keep the chain going so

982
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
hopper it should keep the chain going so
 

983
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,830
hopper it should keep the chain going so
we'll get more and more firework stars

984
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:02,840
we'll get more and more firework stars
 

985
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,240
we'll get more and more firework stars
and stuff yeah axis of fireworks there

986
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,250
and stuff yeah axis of fireworks there
 

987
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,280
and stuff yeah axis of fireworks there
we have a detector here whenever we

988
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,290
we have a detector here whenever we
 

989
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,680
we have a detector here whenever we
throw a firework in it'll send the

990
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,690
throw a firework in it'll send the
 

991
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,410
throw a firework in it'll send the
signal out or when we press a button

992
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,420
signal out or when we press a button
 

993
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,100
signal out or when we press a button
here you can see oh I'm losing my voice

994
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,110
here you can see oh I'm losing my voice
 

995
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,260
here you can see oh I'm losing my voice
you can see it goes down into here mom's

996
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,270
you can see it goes down into here mom's
 

997
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,650
you can see it goes down into here mom's
table circuit and yeah oh yeah yeah all

998
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:23,660
table circuit and yeah oh yeah yeah all
 

999
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,230
table circuit and yeah oh yeah yeah all
right anyways let's try this out oh yeah

1000
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
right anyways let's try this out oh yeah
 

1001
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,840
right anyways let's try this out oh yeah
item elevator here so the this is

1002
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:28,850
item elevator here so the this is
 

1003
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,070
item elevator here so the this is
actually pretty important I should show

1004
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
actually pretty important I should show
 

1005
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,960
actually pretty important I should show
this from here I think I can figure out

1006
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:34,970
this from here I think I can figure out
 

1007
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,370
this from here I think I can figure out
how to see it again well I just put some

1008
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:39,380
how to see it again well I just put some
 

1009
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,020
how to see it again well I just put some
garbage into this system

1010
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,030
garbage into this system
 

1011
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,410
garbage into this system
oh so you hear that clicking that's the

1012
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:44,420
oh so you hear that clicking that's the
 

1013
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,330
oh so you hear that clicking that's the
item elevator so this sentence stars

1014
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,340
item elevator so this sentence stars
 

1015
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,310
item elevator so this sentence stars
down the stopper chain into an item

1016
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
down the stopper chain into an item
 

1017
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,530
down the stopper chain into an item
elevator here there's any items in here

1018
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:52,540
elevator here there's any items in here
 

1019
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,240
elevator here there's any items in here
it activates this circuit which which

1020
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,250
it activates this circuit which which
 

1021
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,700
it activates this circuit which which
sends them up the to the top there to

1022
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:57,710
sends them up the to the top there to
 

1023
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,200
sends them up the to the top there to
that chest and then they get funneled

1024
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,210
that chest and then they get funneled
 

1025
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,880
that chest and then they get funneled
into that dropper we saw before so I was

1026
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:03,890
into that dropper we saw before so I was
 

1027
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,650
into that dropper we saw before so I was
originally planning on sending the items

1028
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:05,660
originally planning on sending the items
 

1029
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,290
originally planning on sending the items
through the half slab here in the mid

1030
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,300
through the half slab here in the mid
 

1031
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,240
through the half slab here in the mid
but I didn't think this through I guess

1032
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,250
but I didn't think this through I guess
 

1033
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,060
but I didn't think this through I guess
I got the hopper down here now so it's

1034
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,070
I got the hopper down here now so it's
 

1035
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,650
I got the hopper down here now so it's
just going to send items into the hopper

1036
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:14,660
just going to send items into the hopper
 

1037
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,150
just going to send items into the hopper
if I do that maybe I'll put it off to

1038
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,160
if I do that maybe I'll put it off to
 

1039
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,510
if I do that maybe I'll put it off to
the side or something so let's try this

1040
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
the side or something so let's try this
 

1041
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,730
the side or something so let's try this
out I'm just going to do do it like this

1042
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:21,740
out I'm just going to do do it like this
 

1043
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:28,050
out I'm just going to do do it like this
probably and in case this like a so

1044
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,060
probably and in case this like a so
 

1045
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,040
probably and in case this like a so
alright make sure the water doesn't

1046
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,050
alright make sure the water doesn't
 

1047
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,840
alright make sure the water doesn't
spill into the redstone if it does I

1048
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:31,850
spill into the redstone if it does I
 

1049
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,090
spill into the redstone if it does I
will lose my mind because I don't want

1050
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,100
will lose my mind because I don't want
 

1051
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,570
will lose my mind because I don't want
to do this again all right do something

1052
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:37,580
to do this again all right do something
 

1053
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,210
to do this again all right do something
like that like that that should work so

1054
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,220
like that like that that should work so
 

1055
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,850
like that like that that should work so
I'm going to put my water bucket right

1056
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm going to put my water bucket right
 

1057
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,670
I'm going to put my water bucket right
here I did this right right double-check

1058
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:47,680
here I did this right right double-check
 

1059
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,490
here I did this right right double-check
okay I hate putting water next to

1060
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:51,500
okay I hate putting water next to
 

1061
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,820
okay I hate putting water next to
redstone but it has to be done sometimes

1062
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:53,830
redstone but it has to be done sometimes
 

1063
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,050
redstone but it has to be done sometimes
cover this up so the droppers don't

1064
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,060
cover this up so the droppers don't
 

1065
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,880
cover this up so the droppers don't
shoot the items out over over the edge

1066
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:57,890
shoot the items out over over the edge
 

1067
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,910
shoot the items out over over the edge
or something like that one star right

1068
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:00,920
or something like that one star right
 

1069
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,910
or something like that one star right
now and one gunpowder let's see if

1070
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:03,920
now and one gunpowder let's see if
 

1071
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,470
now and one gunpowder let's see if
that's what we get I should put some

1072
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
that's what we get I should put some
 

1073
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,020
that's what we get I should put some
some kind of floor there maybe mmmm

1074
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,030
some kind of floor there maybe mmmm
 

1075
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,070
some kind of floor there maybe mmmm
that's an idea

1076
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
that's an idea
 

1077
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
that's an idea
all right let's do that so what do we

1078
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,330
all right let's do that so what do we
 

1079
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,780
all right let's do that so what do we
get we got one start one gunpowder why

1080
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:16,790
get we got one start one gunpowder why
 

1081
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,530
get we got one start one gunpowder why
didn't I get my paper and stuff that is

1082
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:20,540
didn't I get my paper and stuff that is
 

1083
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,970
didn't I get my paper and stuff that is
what I'm wondering all right very good

1084
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:24,980
what I'm wondering all right very good
 

1085
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,130
what I'm wondering all right very good
we got this fixed up I think I made the

1086
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,140
we got this fixed up I think I made the
 

1087
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,290
we got this fixed up I think I made the
mistake of thinking this comparator wire

1088
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:29,300
mistake of thinking this comparator wire
 

1089
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,650
mistake of thinking this comparator wire
was turning on all the way every time

1090
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:31,660
was turning on all the way every time
 

1091
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,870
was turning on all the way every time
and in reality if we only have one star

1092
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
and in reality if we only have one star
 

1093
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
and in reality if we only have one star
selected it's only going to reach up to

1094
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,290
selected it's only going to reach up to
 

1095
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,770
selected it's only going to reach up to
here two stars up to here three stars up

1096
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:38,780
here two stars up to here three stars up
 

1097
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,760
here two stars up to here three stars up
to here and I had some stuff hooked up

1098
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:42,770
to here and I had some stuff hooked up
 

1099
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,510
to here and I had some stuff hooked up
to it like my gunpowder for the for

1100
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
to it like my gunpowder for the for
 

1101
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,640
to it like my gunpowder for the for
making the fireworks and the paper was

1102
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:48,650
making the fireworks and the paper was
 

1103
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,070
making the fireworks and the paper was
hooked up to it so that was not getting

1104
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,080
hooked up to it so that was not getting
 

1105
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,890
hooked up to it so that was not getting
activated unless I had it set to five

1106
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:53,900
activated unless I had it set to five
 

1107
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,220
activated unless I had it set to five
