skinny mountain we are going to build
 

647
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,100
skinny mountain we are going to build
our glowing tree

648
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,110

 

649
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,710

651
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,060
and I didn't bring a whole lot of leaves
with me so we're just going to do a

652
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,070
with me so we're just going to do a
 

653
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,380
with me so we're just going to do a
classic style

654
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,390
classic style
 

655
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,139
classic style
I suppose put our glow device there then

656
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:37,149
I suppose put our glow device there then
 

657
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:42,500
I suppose put our glow device there then
use a torch pumpkin glowstone looks good

use a torch pumpkin glowstone looks good
 

659
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:49,230
use a torch pumpkin glowstone looks good
and we'll build a five by five at it's

660
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:49,240
and we'll build a five by five at it's
 

661
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,000
and we'll build a five by five at it's
unfortunate you can't do this with

662
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,010
unfortunate you can't do this with
 

663
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,799
unfortunate you can't do this with
regular trees though because once you

664
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:52,809
regular trees though because once you
 

665
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,860
regular trees though because once you
remove the wood block to replace with

666
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:55,870
remove the wood block to replace with
 

667
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,460

your torch or whatever though all the

668
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,470
your torch or whatever though all the
 

669
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,720
your torch or whatever though all the
leaves just start dying so otherwise I

670
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:03,730
leaves just start dying so otherwise I
 

671
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,090
leaves just start dying so otherwise I
would replace all the trees in my world

672
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,100
would replace all the trees in my world
 

673
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,269
would replace all the trees in my world
with glowing trees so they look they

674
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
with glowing trees so they look they
 

675
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,700

684
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
and we'll top it off with a classic plus
 

685
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:43,740
and we'll top it off with a classic plus

697
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,640
there that's the six mile yeah so we're
just missing the snow dilution biome and

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:07,650
just missing the snow dilution biome and
 

699
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,740
just missing the snow dilution biome and
the the pine forest one that's those are

the the pine forest one that's those are
 

701
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,310
the the pine forest one that's those are
only three we have to find yet and I was

any trees for decoration I'll do the
 

745
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,920
any trees for decoration I'll do the
glowing trees and other than that I'll

746
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:38,930
glowing trees and other than that I'll
 

747
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,420
glowing trees and other than that I'll
probably use lava and we need to try

748
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,430
probably use lava and we need to try
 

749
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,310
probably use lava and we need to try
we'll probably figure out some other

750

we'll probably figure out some other
 

751
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,820
we'll probably figure out some other
things you guys have any suggestions on

still so yeah next episode we are going
 

765
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,650
still so yeah next episode we are going
to check out some of these tunnels oops

766
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:20,660
to check out some of these tunnels oops
 

767
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:28,410
to check out some of these tunnels oops
I'm not healing light no I'm not oh man

769
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,370

yeah we'll check out some more of the

770
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:30,380
yeah we'll check out some more of the
 

771
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,740
yeah we'll check out some more of the
tunnels and then the mineshaft and we'll

772
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:35,750
tunnels and then the mineshaft and we'll
 

773
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,100
tunnels and then the mineshaft and we'll
probably try start setting this place up

774
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,110
probably try start setting this place up
 

775
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,450
probably try start setting this place up
and making it look nice nicer it looks

776
