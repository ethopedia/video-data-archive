00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,549
hello everyone welcome back this is etho
and today we're going to be working on

6
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
and today we're going to be working on
 

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,390
and today we're going to be working on
the slime farm a little bit

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
the slime farm a little bit
 

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,269
the slime farm a little bit
we set up this area here i think a few

10
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
we set up this area here i think a few
 

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,189
we set up this area here i think a few
days ago maybe a few weeks ago i can't

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
days ago maybe a few weeks ago i can't
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,710
days ago maybe a few weeks ago i can't
remember

14
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
remember
 

15
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,310
remember
i've just been watching it making sure

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
i've just been watching it making sure
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,070
i've just been watching it making sure
it's working well getting good numbers

18
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
it's working well getting good numbers
 

19
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,670
it's working well getting good numbers
and yeah you can see it's getting good

20
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
and yeah you can see it's getting good
 

21
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,589
and yeah you can see it's getting good
numbers it'll be even better once i shut

22
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
numbers it'll be even better once i shut
 

23
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,189
numbers it'll be even better once i shut
down the other slime farm too

24
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
down the other slime farm too
 

25
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,830
down the other slime farm too
so i think we're ready to go ahead with

26
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
so i think we're ready to go ahead with
 

27
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,709
so i think we're ready to go ahead with
this project

28
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
this project
 

29
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,310
this project
and start automating it so we'll have to

30
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
and start automating it so we'll have to
 

31
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,110
and start automating it so we'll have to
set up water canals all around

32
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
set up water canals all around
 

33
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,790
set up water canals all around
the perimeter of it might try

34
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
the perimeter of it might try
 

35
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,150
the perimeter of it might try
to set up a shut off system for it to

36
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
to set up a shut off system for it to
 

37
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,270
to set up a shut off system for it to
prevent the slimes from

38
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
prevent the slimes from
 

39
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,310
prevent the slimes from
spawning have to play around with that

40
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
spawning have to play around with that
 

41
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,069
spawning have to play around with that
idea

42
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
idea
 

43
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,110
idea
possibly might separate the different

44
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
possibly might separate the different
 

45
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,069
possibly might separate the different
sizes too

46
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
sizes too
 

47
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,549
sizes too
so we have small ones medium and large

48
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
so we have small ones medium and large
 

49
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,070
so we have small ones medium and large
um yeah i find as long as i'm within

50
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
um yeah i find as long as i'm within
 

51
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,590
um yeah i find as long as i'm within
this area

52
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
this area
 

53
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,830
this area
i get tons of slimes here because

54
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
i get tons of slimes here because
 

55
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,070
i get tons of slimes here because
other mobs despawn but these guys don't

56
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
other mobs despawn but these guys don't
 

57
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,310
other mobs despawn but these guys don't
unless you leave the area if you go 128

58
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
unless you leave the area if you go 128
 

59
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,990
unless you leave the area if you go 128
blocks away from them then i think they

60
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
blocks away from them then i think they
 

61
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,670
blocks away from them then i think they
all just disappear so

62
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
all just disappear so
 

63
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,910
all just disappear so
as long as i'm in the general area of my

64
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
as long as i'm in the general area of my
 

65
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,109
as long as i'm in the general area of my
cave here

66
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
cave here
 

67
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,429
cave here
uh this this room fills up with slimes

68
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
uh this this room fills up with slimes
 

69
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,390
uh this this room fills up with slimes
that's how i get so many

70
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
that's how i get so many
 

71
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,910
that's how i get so many
okay let's get going here

72
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920

 

73
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,990

yep so the first thing i've been doing

74
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
yep so the first thing i've been doing
 

75
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,830
yep so the first thing i've been doing
here is i'm trying to polish it up a bit

76
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
here is i'm trying to polish it up a bit
 

77
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,310
here is i'm trying to polish it up a bit
i got rid of the rough cave walls and

78
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
i got rid of the rough cave walls and
 

79
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,950
i got rid of the rough cave walls and
replaced them with stone brick

80
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
replaced them with stone brick
 

81
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,990
replaced them with stone brick
and the floor all the way around in the

82
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
and the floor all the way around in the
 

83
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
and the floor all the way around in the
middle i put soil down and then i

84
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
middle i put soil down and then i
 

85
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,710
middle i put soil down and then i
brought

86
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
brought
 

87
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,950
brought
a few uh grass blocks that i got with

88
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
a few uh grass blocks that i got with
 

89
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,830
a few uh grass blocks that i got with
silk touch

90
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
silk touch
 

91
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,149
silk touch
so we got grass spreading here give the

92
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
so we got grass spreading here give the
 

93
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,469
so we got grass spreading here give the
place a little bit of color

94
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
place a little bit of color
 

95
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,870
place a little bit of color
and on this side we have a nice viewing

96
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
and on this side we have a nice viewing
 

97
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,069
and on this side we have a nice viewing
window

98
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
window
 

99
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,429
window
so you can see right out there is the

100
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
so you can see right out there is the
 

101
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,350
so you can see right out there is the
tree farm actually so we'll be able to

102
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
tree farm actually so we'll be able to
 

103
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,389
tree farm actually so we'll be able to
walk up and look inside here and see

104
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
walk up and look inside here and see
 

105
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,069
walk up and look inside here and see
what the slimes are up to which is

106
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
what the slimes are up to which is
 

107
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,550
what the slimes are up to which is
pretty cool that's a neat thing about

108
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
pretty cool that's a neat thing about
 

109
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,830
pretty cool that's a neat thing about
having the slime farm

110
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
having the slime farm
 

111
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,190
having the slime farm
up higher and having cave system like we

112
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
up higher and having cave system like we
 

113
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,949
up higher and having cave system like we
have here

114
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
have here
 

115
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,670
have here
so the actual height we're at right now

116
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
so the actual height we're at right now
 

117
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,390
so the actual height we're at right now
is

118
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
is
 

119
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,830
is
y 40.6 you bring up this menu pressing

120
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
y 40.6 you bring up this menu pressing
 

121
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,190
y 40.6 you bring up this menu pressing
f3 by the way

122
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
f3 by the way
 

123
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,470
f3 by the way
as you probably know i tried going one

124
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
as you probably know i tried going one
 

125
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,510
as you probably know i tried going one
block higher

126
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
block higher
 

127
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,270
block higher
i had this whole spawning pad one block

128
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
i had this whole spawning pad one block
 

129
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,030
i had this whole spawning pad one block
higher just to see if it would work

130
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
higher just to see if it would work
 

131
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,750
higher just to see if it would work
and no slimes are spawning so i think

132
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
and no slimes are spawning so i think
 

133
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,229
and no slimes are spawning so i think
this is

134
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
this is
 

135
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,430
this is
absolute highest you can go 40.6

136
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
absolute highest you can go 40.6
 

137
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,309
absolute highest you can go 40.6
keep that in mind what i'm going to do

138
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
keep that in mind what i'm going to do
 

139
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,589
keep that in mind what i'm going to do
now

140
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
now
 

141
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,350
now
we can't really have torches on the

142
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
we can't really have torches on the
 

143
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,949
we can't really have torches on the
spawning pad like this i'm just doing

144
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
spawning pad like this i'm just doing
 

145
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,430
spawning pad like this i'm just doing
that

146
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
that
 

147
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,910
that
temporarily because i think they count

148
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
temporarily because i think they count
 

149
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,869
temporarily because i think they count
as an

150
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
as an
 

151
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,910
as an
as an obstructing block

152
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
as an obstructing block
 

153
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,869
as an obstructing block
so they'll prevent slime spawning a

154
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
so they'll prevent slime spawning a
 

155
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,509
so they'll prevent slime spawning a
certain

156
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
certain
 

157
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,309
certain
amount but we need to light up this

158
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
amount but we need to light up this
 

159
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,350
amount but we need to light up this
place a bit

160
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
place a bit
 

161
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,949
place a bit
so that we don't get the other hostile

162
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
so that we don't get the other hostile
 

163
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,509
so that we don't get the other hostile
mobs with slimes though the lighting

164
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
mobs with slimes though the lighting
 

165
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,390
mobs with slimes though the lighting
doesn't matter

166
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
doesn't matter
 

167
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,750
doesn't matter
we just don't want the other hostile

168
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
we just don't want the other hostile
 

169
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,430
we just don't want the other hostile
knobs in here so

170
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440

 

171
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,949

i know in the past you could use

172
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
i know in the past you could use
 

173
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,630
i know in the past you could use
glowstone in the floor

174
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
glowstone in the floor
 

175
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,270
glowstone in the floor
but i think that might not work now

176
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
but i think that might not work now
 

177
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,070
but i think that might not work now
because the

178
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
because the
 

179
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,390
because the
glowstone is treated like a glass block

180
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
glowstone is treated like a glass block
 

181
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,990
glowstone is treated like a glass block
again

182
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
again
 

183
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,910
again
so what i'm going to do i'm going to

184
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
so what i'm going to do i'm going to
 

185
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,509
so what i'm going to do i'm going to
create a backup of my world here and

186
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
create a backup of my world here and
 

187
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,630
create a backup of my world here and
then i'm going to replace

188
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
then i'm going to replace
 

189
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,949
then i'm going to replace
this floor with glowstone as much as i

190
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
this floor with glowstone as much as i
 

191
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,229
this floor with glowstone as much as i
have

192
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
have
 

193
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,789
have
and we'll see if slimes spawn on it

194
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
and we'll see if slimes spawn on it
 

195
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,750
and we'll see if slimes spawn on it
hopefully

196
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
hopefully
 

197
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,910
hopefully
so i'll go i'm gonna go ahead and do

198
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
so i'll go i'm gonna go ahead and do
 

199
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,110
so i'll go i'm gonna go ahead and do
that now

200
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120

 

201
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,710

okay so we're gonna check out the

202
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
okay so we're gonna check out the
 

203
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,789
okay so we're gonna check out the
results now it's been about an

204
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
results now it's been about an
 

205
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,309
results now it's been about an
hour i left my game running while i ate

206
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
hour i left my game running while i ate
 

207
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,430
hour i left my game running while i ate
lunch and stuff

208
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
lunch and stuff
 

209
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,949
lunch and stuff
killed a few spiders in between um

210
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
killed a few spiders in between um
 

211
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,990
killed a few spiders in between um
the usual stuff you know went down to

212
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
the usual stuff you know went down to
 

213
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,869
the usual stuff you know went down to
the other slime farm it was loaded

214
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
the other slime farm it was loaded
 

215
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,949
the other slime farm it was loaded
this one did not have enough glowstone

216
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
this one did not have enough glowstone
 

217
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,589
this one did not have enough glowstone
to do

218
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
to do
 

219
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,190
to do
to do the whole pad so that's why i have

220
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
to do the whole pad so that's why i have
 

221
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,190
to do the whole pad so that's why i have
these torches here i wanted to

222
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
these torches here i wanted to
 

223
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,630
these torches here i wanted to
just make sure that they're an

224
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
just make sure that they're an
 

225
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,110
just make sure that they're an
obstructing block too

226
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
obstructing block too
 

227
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,990
obstructing block too
so no slimes on this side let's check

228
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
so no slimes on this side let's check
 

229
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,070
so no slimes on this side let's check
out over here

230
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
out over here
 

231
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,430
out over here
this is all the glowstone i had

232
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440

 

233
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,949

not seen any

234
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959

 

235
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,390

nope so i don't think they can spawn on

236
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
nope so i don't think they can spawn on
 

237
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,909
nope so i don't think they can spawn on
this

238
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
this
 

239
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,430
this
on the glowstone so that means i can't

240
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
on the glowstone so that means i can't
 

241
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,830
on the glowstone so that means i can't
really

242
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
really
 

243
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,430
really
or i shouldn't really put the lighting

244
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
or i shouldn't really put the lighting
 

245
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,189
or i shouldn't really put the lighting
in the floor i'll have to put it in the

246
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
in the floor i'll have to put it in the
 

247
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,469
in the floor i'll have to put it in the
ceiling

248
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
ceiling
 

249
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,390
ceiling
to prevent the other hostile mobs from

250
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
to prevent the other hostile mobs from
 

251
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,590
to prevent the other hostile mobs from
spawning

252
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
spawning
 

253
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,070
spawning
again it has the lighting conditions

254
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
again it has the lighting conditions
 

255
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,950
again it has the lighting conditions
have no effect

256
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
have no effect
 

257
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,710
have no effect
on slimes you can have it super bright

258
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
on slimes you can have it super bright
 

259
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,469
on slimes you can have it super bright
or super dark it doesn't matter

260
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
or super dark it doesn't matter
 

261
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,469
or super dark it doesn't matter
but i just don't want like creepers and

262
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
but i just don't want like creepers and
 

263
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,909
but i just don't want like creepers and
stuff in here

264
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919

 

265
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,670

okay that's good to know i think i'm

266
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
okay that's good to know i think i'm
 

267
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
okay that's good to know i think i'm
going to load my backup but i might try

268
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
going to load my backup but i might try
 

269
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,469
going to load my backup but i might try
and chant something

270
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
and chant something
 

271
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,350
and chant something
at level 37 here so i gained a few

272
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
at level 37 here so i gained a few
 

273
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,990
at level 37 here so i gained a few
levels killing slimes and spiders so

274
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
levels killing slimes and spiders so
 

275
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,670
levels killing slimes and spiders so
if i did something good maybe i'll keep

276
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
if i did something good maybe i'll keep
 

277
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,350
if i did something good maybe i'll keep
this

278
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
this
 

279
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,029
this
and instead of going to the back up

280
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
and instead of going to the back up
 

281
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,830
and instead of going to the back up
we'll see

282
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840

 

283
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,909

i guess we'll do 36 here on a pick

284
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
i guess we'll do 36 here on a pick
 

285
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,670
i guess we'll do 36 here on a pick
yeah garbage

286
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680

 

287
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,390

all right the backup is loaded here and

288
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
all right the backup is loaded here and
 

289
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,550
all right the backup is loaded here and
i think we should try to figure out

290
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
i think we should try to figure out
 

291
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,909
i think we should try to figure out
how to do the lighting so right now i

292
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
how to do the lighting so right now i
 

293
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,469
how to do the lighting so right now i
got a

294
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
got a
 

295
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,510
got a
four block space from the spawning pad

296
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
four block space from the spawning pad
 

297
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,830
four block space from the spawning pad
to the ceiling

298
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
to the ceiling
 

299
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,029
to the ceiling
four blocks i'd like to keep it at that

300
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
four blocks i'd like to keep it at that
 

301
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,830
four blocks i'd like to keep it at that
because

302
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
because
 

303
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,550
because
when the big slimes are on here i want

304
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
when the big slimes are on here i want
 

305
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,990
when the big slimes are on here i want
them to be able to make it to

306
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
them to be able to make it to
 

307
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,629
them to be able to make it to
the edges quickly without jumping and

308
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
the edges quickly without jumping and
 

309
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,670
the edges quickly without jumping and
hitting their head

310
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
hitting their head
 

311
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,270
hitting their head
and they are uh 2.4

312
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
and they are uh 2.4
 

313
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,629
and they are uh 2.4
blocks high so i think when they jump

314
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
blocks high so i think when they jump
 

315
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,070
blocks high so i think when they jump
if we had a

316
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
if we had a
 

317
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,749
if we had a
only a three high ceiling they would hit

318
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
only a three high ceiling they would hit
 

319
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,350
only a three high ceiling they would hit
their head on it

320
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
their head on it
 

321
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,110
their head on it
so i'm gonna try to keep it at

322
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
so i'm gonna try to keep it at
 

323
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,590
so i'm gonna try to keep it at
four and uh let's see how this works out

324
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
four and uh let's see how this works out
 

325
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
four and uh let's see how this works out
if this was glowstone

326
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
if this was glowstone
 

327
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,990
if this was glowstone
this soil block here that would have a

328
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
this soil block here that would have a
 

329
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,350
this soil block here that would have a
light level of 15

330
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
light level of 15
 

331
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,430
light level of 15
and this would be 14 13 12

332
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
and this would be 14 13 12
 

333
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,230
and this would be 14 13 12
11 10 9 8

334
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
11 10 9 8
 

335
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,909
11 10 9 8
so it's spread out like like that

336
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
so it's spread out like like that
 

337
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,430
so it's spread out like like that
diamond like that

338
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440

 

339
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,510

yeah it should work i'll have to space

340
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
yeah it should work i'll have to space
 

341
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,790
yeah it should work i'll have to space
some

342
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800

 

343
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,909

two three

344
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919

 

345
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,430

so try to alternate it so this works a

346
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
so try to alternate it so this works a
 

347
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,550
so try to alternate it so this works a
little better

348
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560

 

349
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,309

i might have yeah i'd probably have to

350
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
i might have yeah i'd probably have to
 

351
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,309
i might have yeah i'd probably have to
either put glowstone here

352
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
either put glowstone here
 

353
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,830
either put glowstone here
if i want to keep it symmetrical or

354
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
if i want to keep it symmetrical or
 

355
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,510
if i want to keep it symmetrical or
i could put one here next

356
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
i could put one here next
 

357
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,469
i could put one here next
and then it would do a three blocks out

358
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
and then it would do a three blocks out
 

359
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,350
and then it would do a three blocks out
like the one before it

360
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360

 

361
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,189

for minimal lighting anyway minimal

362
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
for minimal lighting anyway minimal
 

363
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,110
for minimal lighting anyway minimal
glowstone

364
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
glowstone
 

365
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,189
glowstone
okay i think i got that figured out

366
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
okay i think i got that figured out
 

367
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,189
okay i think i got that figured out
so i think now we're gonna start setting

368
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
so i think now we're gonna start setting
 

369
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,110
so i think now we're gonna start setting
up the water canals for this thing

370
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
up the water canals for this thing
 

371
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,029
up the water canals for this thing
and our goal is to get the slimes

372
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
and our goal is to get the slimes
 

373
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,270
and our goal is to get the slimes
to this corner here

374
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280

 

375
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,230

okay so i think the way i'm going to

376
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
okay so i think the way i'm going to
 

377
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,309
okay so i think the way i'm going to
start this is just

378
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
start this is just
 

379
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,510
start this is just
set up the water so it ends just shy of

380
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
set up the water so it ends just shy of
 

381
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,309
set up the water so it ends just shy of
that

382
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
that
 

383
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,670
that
we're gonna have like a three three by

384
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
we're gonna have like a three three by
 

385
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,309
we're gonna have like a three three by
three area here without water on

386
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319

 

387
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,909

uh this is going gonna be quite the

388
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
uh this is going gonna be quite the
 

389
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,270
uh this is going gonna be quite the
challenge for me i don't know if you

390
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
challenge for me i don't know if you
 

391
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,070
challenge for me i don't know if you
know this but i've never actually made

392
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
know this but i've never actually made
 

393
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,350
know this but i've never actually made
an automated slime farm before so this

394
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
an automated slime farm before so this
 

395
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,670
an automated slime farm before so this
is

396
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
is
 

397
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,830
is
kind of new for me this one will go

398
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
kind of new for me this one will go
 

399
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,230
kind of new for me this one will go
here yeah that's where we want it

400
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
here yeah that's where we want it
 

401
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,990
here yeah that's where we want it
um

402
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000

 

403
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,790

good so it'll end here and then we'll

404
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
good so it'll end here and then we'll
 

405
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,749
good so it'll end here and then we'll
figure out what we

406
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
figure out what we
 

407
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,430
figure out what we
want to do with them after that because

408
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
want to do with them after that because
 

409
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,469
want to do with them after that because
i don't quite know everything

410
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
i don't quite know everything
 

411
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,469
i don't quite know everything
that we're gonna do i'm making this up

412
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
that we're gonna do i'm making this up
 

413
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,469
that we're gonna do i'm making this up
as we go along

414
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
as we go along
 

415
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,510
as we go along
uh we will have signs then

416
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520

 

417
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,110

and we're kind of we're doing the water

418
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
and we're kind of we're doing the water
 

419
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,950
and we're kind of we're doing the water
canals backwards here

420
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
canals backwards here
 

421
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,029
canals backwards here
oops sort of

422
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039

 

423
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:40,070

and i don't have any more signs hmm

424
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
and i don't have any more signs hmm
 

425
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,149
and i don't have any more signs hmm
okay um yes it's gonna be boring so i'll

426
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
okay um yes it's gonna be boring so i'll
 

427
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,750
okay um yes it's gonna be boring so i'll
skip it

428
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
skip it
 

429
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,870
skip it
and uh give you progress updates maybe

430
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880

 

431
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,790

all right here's the first attempt at

432
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
all right here's the first attempt at
 

433
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,310
all right here's the first attempt at
the water canals so

434
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
the water canals so
 

435
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,470
the water canals so
like we saw before this one runs

436
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
like we saw before this one runs
 

437
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,590
like we saw before this one runs
the full eight block length and at the

438
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
the full eight block length and at the
 

439
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,070
the full eight block length and at the
three by three that i want

440
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
three by three that i want
 

441
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,350
three by three that i want
then i use a signs over here sign on the

442
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
then i use a signs over here sign on the
 

443
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,949
then i use a signs over here sign on the
sign trick

444
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
sign trick
 

445
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,030
sign trick
there's stairs directly below the water

446
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
there's stairs directly below the water
 

447
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,470
there's stairs directly below the water
source blocks here

448
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
source blocks here
 

449
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,230
source blocks here
so the slime should be able to get

450
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
so the slime should be able to get
 

451
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,310
so the slime should be able to get
pushed up

452
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
pushed up
 

453
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,630
pushed up
um then there is a one two three

454
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
um then there is a one two three
 

455
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,550
um then there is a one two three
block water stream there

456
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560

 

457
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,990

and this corner i don't know how this

458
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
and this corner i don't know how this
 

459
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,670
and this corner i don't know how this
corner is going to work but i got three

460
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
corner is going to work but i got three
 

461
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,190
corner is going to work but i got three
water source blocks there

462
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
water source blocks there
 

463
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,829
water source blocks there
and one here and it does

464
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
and one here and it does
 

465
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,870
and one here and it does
this

466
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880

 

467
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,509

so it should hopefully pull them around

468
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
so it should hopefully pull them around
 

469
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,230
so it should hopefully pull them around
the corner

470
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240

 

471
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,829

but there might be a little bit of a

472
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
but there might be a little bit of a
 

473
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,590
but there might be a little bit of a
problem with the big slimes this

474
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
problem with the big slimes this
 

475
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,110
problem with the big slimes this
one water source block there is going

476
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
one water source block there is going
 

477
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,630
one water source block there is going
this direction slightly

478
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640

 

479
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,710

i'm hoping these ones overpowered

480
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
i'm hoping these ones overpowered
 

481
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,389
i'm hoping these ones overpowered
because they're going straight that way

482
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399

 

483
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,069

but we'll see i'll have to watch this

484
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
but we'll see i'll have to watch this
 

485
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,990
but we'll see i'll have to watch this
it's tough making this because i don't

486
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
it's tough making this because i don't
 

487
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,949
it's tough making this because i don't
have

488
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
have
 

489
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,790
have
i'm not using single player commands or

490
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
i'm not using single player commands or
 

491
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,710
i'm not using single player commands or
anything like that so i can't exactly

492
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
anything like that so i can't exactly
 

493
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,670
anything like that so i can't exactly
just

494
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
just
 

495
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,870
just
spawn a bunch of slimes and see how they

496
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
spawn a bunch of slimes and see how they
 

497
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,670
spawn a bunch of slimes and see how they
react here

498
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
react here
 

499
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,069
react here
now this water stream here is seven

500
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
now this water stream here is seven
 

501
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,870
now this water stream here is seven
blocks long

502
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
blocks long
 

503
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,910
blocks long
one two three four five six seven

504
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
one two three four five six seven
 

505
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,949
one two three four five six seven
again it meets up with the stairs here

506
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
again it meets up with the stairs here
 

507
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,790
again it meets up with the stairs here
to bring them up

508
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800

 

509
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,190

and this one is a full eight blocks

510
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
and this one is a full eight blocks
 

511
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,790
and this one is a full eight blocks
length

512
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
length
 

513
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,829
length
i'll probably have uh this a three by

514
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
i'll probably have uh this a three by
 

515
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,350
i'll probably have uh this a three by
three column up to

516
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
three column up to
 

517
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,110
three column up to
the ceiling here too i don't think it's

518
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
the ceiling here too i don't think it's
 

519
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,870
the ceiling here too i don't think it's
really necessary to have this

520
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
really necessary to have this
 

521
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,150
really necessary to have this
open space and it simplifies things

522
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
open space and it simplifies things
 

523
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,389
open space and it simplifies things
if you don't have to make the slimes go

524
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
if you don't have to make the slimes go
 

525
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,590
if you don't have to make the slimes go
around a corner so that's why i did that

526
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
around a corner so that's why i did that
 

527
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,790
around a corner so that's why i did that
this side same thing eight blocks

528
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
this side same thing eight blocks
 

529
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,190
this side same thing eight blocks
seven blocks stairs

530
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
seven blocks stairs
 

531
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,069
seven blocks stairs
weird corner thing

532
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079

 

533
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,069

and oh i forgot to put water

534
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
and oh i forgot to put water
 

535
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,350
and oh i forgot to put water
there it does also go

536
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
there it does also go
 

537
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,829
there it does also go
over slightly in places so i might have

538
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
over slightly in places so i might have
 

539
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,350
over slightly in places so i might have
to put a sign

540
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
to put a sign
 

541
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,509
to put a sign
like where this water is flowing over

542
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
like where this water is flowing over
 

543
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,630
like where this water is flowing over
there

544
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640

 

545
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,949

if it's causing problems in total

546
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
if it's causing problems in total
 

547
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,110
if it's causing problems in total
there's 12 signs

548
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
there's 12 signs
 

549
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,389
there's 12 signs
used in this

550
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399

 

551
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,550

there it is but i do have water here and

552
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
there it is but i do have water here and
 

553
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,870
there it is but i do have water here and
here as well

554
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
here as well
 

555
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,630
here as well
goes upstairs

556
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640

 

557
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,670

and then another full eight blocks so

558
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
and then another full eight blocks so
 

559
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,590
and then another full eight blocks so
i think i'm gonna watch this for a while

560
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
i think i'm gonna watch this for a while
 

561
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,509
i think i'm gonna watch this for a while
and see what happens

562
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
and see what happens
 

563
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,509
and see what happens
and we'll see if any big slimes get

564
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
and we'll see if any big slimes get
 

565
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,870
and we'll see if any big slimes get
stuck in the corners i'm not sure

566
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
stuck in the corners i'm not sure
 

567
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,350
stuck in the corners i'm not sure
and i think next i'll do the lighting

568
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
and i think next i'll do the lighting
 

569
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,310
and i think next i'll do the lighting
here

570
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
here
 

571
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,670
here
i'm going to try to figure out a pattern

572
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
i'm going to try to figure out a pattern
 

573
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,870
i'm going to try to figure out a pattern
to do

574
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880

 

575
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,030

i used paintshop pro to help me figure

576
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
i used paintshop pro to help me figure
 

577
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,629
i used paintshop pro to help me figure
out a pattern for the lighting and i

578
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
out a pattern for the lighting and i
 

579
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,829
out a pattern for the lighting and i
found one that i

580
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
found one that i
 

581
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,790
found one that i
i like pretty good pretty well pretty

582
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
i like pretty good pretty well pretty
 

583
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,670
i like pretty good pretty well pretty
whatever

whatever
 

585
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,350
whatever
um so we're gonna count

586
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
um so we're gonna count
 

587
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,550
um so we're gonna count
to the center so one two three

588
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
to the center so one two three
 

589
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,670
to the center so one two three
four five six seven eight oh that is the

590
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
four five six seven eight oh that is the
 

591
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,110
four five six seven eight oh that is the
center

592
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
center
 

593
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,310
center
i just uh i think that's the center

594
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
i just uh i think that's the center
 

595
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,430
i just uh i think that's the center
i just put down that water randomly

596
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
i just put down that water randomly
 

597
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,870
i just put down that water randomly
kind of use my eyes to figure out where

598
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
kind of use my eyes to figure out where
 

599
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,110
kind of use my eyes to figure out where
the center was i guess i got it right

600
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
the center was i guess i got it right
 

601
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,710
the center was i guess i got it right
awesome okay

602
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
awesome okay
 

603
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,990
awesome okay
so right here is our center

604
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
so right here is our center
 

605
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,670
so right here is our center
i'm gonna put four glowstone here

606
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680

 

607
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,949

like so and then from the from the

608
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
like so and then from the from the
 

609
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,750
like so and then from the from the
corners

610
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
corners
 

611
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,310
corners
every two blocks will put a glowstone

612
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
every two blocks will put a glowstone
 

613
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,550
every two blocks will put a glowstone
and that will this is a symmetrical

614
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
and that will this is a symmetrical
 

615
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,470
and that will this is a symmetrical
style we figured out before

616
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
style we figured out before
 

617
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,350
style we figured out before
so provides a little bit more light than

618
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
so provides a little bit more light than
 

619
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,990
so provides a little bit more light than
we need

620
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
we need
 

621
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,670
we need
but that's okay i don't mind

622
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
but that's okay i don't mind
 

623
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,150
but that's okay i don't mind
uh sacrificing a few extra glowstone

624
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
uh sacrificing a few extra glowstone
 

625
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,269
uh sacrificing a few extra glowstone
it'll look better in here if it's

626
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
it'll look better in here if it's
 

627
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,949
it'll look better in here if it's
brighter too

628

is the pattern
 

681
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,590
is the pattern
so in total that is 32 glowstone

682
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600

 

683
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,670

691
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,990

and every every two blocks from the

692
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
and every every two blocks from the
 

693
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,030
and every every two blocks from the
corner

694
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
corner
 

695
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,829
corner
you put a glowstone then two blocks for

696
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
you put a glowstone then two blocks for
 

697
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,389
you put a glowstone then two blocks for
this one

698
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
this one
 

699
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,949
this one
all four corners and it creates this

700
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
all four corners and it creates this
 

701
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,670
all four corners and it creates this
pattern so

702
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
pattern so
 

703
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,629

i can assure you there was a good reason

790
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
i can assure you there was a good reason
 

791
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,990
i can assure you there was a good reason
for it but it's too complicated to

792
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
for it but it's too complicated to
 

793
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,029
for it but it's too complicated to
explain so just

794
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
explain so just
 

795
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,549

okay uh this is the messiest part of
 

799
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,270
okay uh this is the messiest part of
the cave i would say past experiments

800
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
the cave i would say past experiments
 

801
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,669
the cave i would say past experiments
and random blocks everywhere

802
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
and random blocks everywhere
 

803
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,590
and random blocks everywhere
we're going to try to give it a little

804
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
we're going to try to give it a little
 

805
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,950
we're going to try to give it a little
bit of order today

806
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
bit of order today
 

807
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,230
bit of order today
not much just a little uh

808
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
not much just a little uh
 

809
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,390
not much just a little uh
the idea originally was to have like a

810
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
the idea originally was to have like a
 

811
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,549
the idea originally was to have like a
drop down to the farm here

812
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
drop down to the farm here
 

813
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,750
drop down to the farm here
this is the drop down

814
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
this is the drop down
 

815
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,510
this is the drop down
and you're at the farm and this is the

816
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
and you're at the farm and this is the
 

817
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,190
and you're at the farm and this is the
climb back up

818
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200

 

819
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,270

so i think what we'll do

820
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280

 

821
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,870

instead of having ladders i want to have

822
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
instead of having ladders i want to have
 

823
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,909
instead of having ladders i want to have
just a water

824
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919

 

825
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,390

system to get back up so we'll replace

826
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
system to get back up so we'll replace
 

827
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,590
system to get back up so we'll replace
this with stone

828
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
this with stone
 

829
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,350
this with stone
brick oops

830
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360

 

831
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,430

all the way up

832
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440

 

833
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,710

like so

834
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720

 

835
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,830

yep so i'm going to put uh alternating

836
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
yep so i'm going to put uh alternating
 

837
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,990
yep so i'm going to put uh alternating
signs and water all the way up here

838
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
signs and water all the way up here
 

839
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,110
signs and water all the way up here
much like a mob system tubing thing

840
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
much like a mob system tubing thing
 

841
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,470
much like a mob system tubing thing
uh this will be up

842
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
uh this will be up
 

843
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,870
uh this will be up
this is more of a personal preference i

844
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
this is more of a personal preference i
 

845
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,230
this is more of a personal preference i
guess and to give it a little more

846
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
guess and to give it a little more
 

847
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,669
guess and to give it a little more
character

848
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
character
 

849
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,750
character
um over compared to like a ladder

850
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
um over compared to like a ladder
 

851
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,909
um over compared to like a ladder
going up and this is something i believe

852
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
going up and this is something i believe
 

853
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,150
going up and this is something i believe
i

854
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
i
 

855
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,909
i
timed before in the past and then we

856
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
timed before in the past and then we
 

857
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,310
timed before in the past and then we
take about the same time to go up a

858
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
take about the same time to go up a
 

859
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,070
take about the same time to go up a
ladder and to swim up a water

860
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
ladder and to swim up a water
 

861
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,549
ladder and to swim up a water
thing like this so

862
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559

 

863
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,750

not a big deal the water might actually

864
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
not a big deal the water might actually
 

865
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:55,990
not a big deal the water might actually
be

866
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
be
 

867
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,590
be
quicker because you get a little bit of

868
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
quicker because you get a little bit of
 

869
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,669
quicker because you get a little bit of
acceleration boost

870
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
acceleration boost
 

871
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,510
acceleration boost
uh right off the bat when you when you

872
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
uh right off the bat when you when you
 

873
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,270
uh right off the bat when you when you
jump so you go

874
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
jump so you go
 

875
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,110
jump so you go
pretty quick right right at the

876
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
pretty quick right right at the
 

877
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,310
pretty quick right right at the
beginning there

878
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
beginning there
 

879
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,590
beginning there
and then it slows down to like ladder

880
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
and then it slows down to like ladder
 

881
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,990
and then it slows down to like ladder
speed

882
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
speed
 

883
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,029
speed
i think

884
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039

 

885
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,190

although might be something worth

886
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
although might be something worth
 

887
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,070
although might be something worth
testing

888
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080

 

889
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,630

but anyway i would i prefer to hold

890
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
but anyway i would i prefer to hold
 

891
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,750
but anyway i would i prefer to hold
space to go up

892
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
space to go up
 

893
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,270
space to go up
compared to holding w

894
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
compared to holding w
 

895
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,470
compared to holding w
just just my preference

896
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480

 

897
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,150

yep i don't know about you guys but i'm

898
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
yep i don't know about you guys but i'm
 

899
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,190
yep i don't know about you guys but i'm
really looking forward to

900
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
really looking forward to
 

901
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,029
really looking forward to
a new patch hopefully one comes out soon

902
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
a new patch hopefully one comes out soon
 

903
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,950
a new patch hopefully one comes out soon
um i know it just feels like it's been a

904
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
um i know it just feels like it's been a
 

905
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,549
um i know it just feels like it's been a
while

906
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
while
 

907
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,669
while
since we last got a new patch because

908
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
since we last got a new patch because
 

909
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,990
since we last got a new patch because
when 1.0 came out there wasn't really

910
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
when 1.0 came out there wasn't really
 

911
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,590
when 1.0 came out there wasn't really
anything new in it compared to 1.9

912
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
anything new in it compared to 1.9
 

913
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,430
anything new in it compared to 1.9
and i think it's been a few weeks we got

914
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
and i think it's been a few weeks we got
 

915
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,270
and i think it's been a few weeks we got
the snapshots of course but i haven't

916
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
the snapshots of course but i haven't
 

917
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,710
the snapshots of course but i haven't
been checking those out

918
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
been checking those out
 

919
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,789
been checking those out
personally is it

920
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
personally is it
 

921
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,830
personally is it
not a big fan of them they're kind of

922
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840
not a big fan of them they're kind of
 

923
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,149
not a big fan of them they're kind of
like

924
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
like
 

925
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,190
like
the pre-releases which i did like the

926
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
the pre-releases which i did like the
 

927
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,630
the pre-releases which i did like the
pre-releases except

928
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
pre-releases except
 

929
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,230
pre-releases except
uh problem with the snapshots is they're

930
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
uh problem with the snapshots is they're
 

931
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,390
uh problem with the snapshots is they're
not taking the time to make sure

932
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
not taking the time to make sure
 

933
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,830
not taking the time to make sure
any serious bugs are out of it i don't

934
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
any serious bugs are out of it i don't
 

935
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,549
any serious bugs are out of it i don't
think

936
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
think
 

937
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,510
think
i thought i saw a creeper i could be

938
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
i thought i saw a creeper i could be
 

939
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,310
i thought i saw a creeper i could be
wrong about that

940
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
wrong about that
 

941
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,110
wrong about that
but i'm a little eerie about using them

942
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
but i'm a little eerie about using them
 

943
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,190
but i'm a little eerie about using them
i heard in the new snapshot that ladders

944
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
i heard in the new snapshot that ladders
 

945
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,830
i heard in the new snapshot that ladders
aren't going to have a collision mask

946
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
aren't going to have a collision mask
 

947
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,830
aren't going to have a collision mask
a little bit disappointed about that

948
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
a little bit disappointed about that
 

949
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,190
a little bit disappointed about that
because

950
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
because
 

951
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,590
because
that means that's another really hard

952
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
that means that's another really hard
 

953
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,310
that means that's another really hard
hit for each road

954
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
hit for each road
 

955
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,830
hit for each road
although it's still possible you just

956
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
although it's still possible you just
 

957
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,630
although it's still possible you just
have to use no

958
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
have to use no
 

959
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,510
have to use no
no no no no what did that do

960
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520

 

961
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,750

it's all right guys it's all right it's

962
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
it's all right guys it's all right it's
 

963
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,549
it's all right guys it's all right it's
all right it's got a little wet

964
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
all right it's got a little wet
 

965
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,070
all right it's got a little wet
let's try this out

966
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

 

967
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,590

that's not bad yeah eats road will still

968
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
that's not bad yeah eats road will still
 

969
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,390
that's not bad yeah eats road will still
work you just have to

970
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400

 

971
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,549

use full blocks or trap doors or

972
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
use full blocks or trap doors or
 

973
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,270
use full blocks or trap doors or
something else

974
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
something else
 

975
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,149
something else
above the boat but just can't use

976
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
above the boat but just can't use
 

977
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,430
above the boat but just can't use
ladders anymore

978
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
ladders anymore
 

979
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,110
ladders anymore
and the thing is uh

980
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
and the thing is uh
 

981
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,630
and the thing is uh
like the issue with the ladders i think

982
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
like the issue with the ladders i think
 

983
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,230
like the issue with the ladders i think
the reason they changed it is because

984
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
the reason they changed it is because
 

985
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,070
the reason they changed it is because
they're so glitchy now if you try

986
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
they're so glitchy now if you try
 

987
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,669
they're so glitchy now if you try
to

988
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679

 

989
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,270

like break them you can have serious

990
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
like break them you can have serious
 

991
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,070
like break them you can have serious
issues or

992
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
issues or
 

993
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,789
issues or
place them even sometimes like you'll

994
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
place them even sometimes like you'll
 

995
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,149
place them even sometimes like you'll
place them against the wall

996
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
place them against the wall
 

997
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,190
place them against the wall
and they'll go to the side

998
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
and they'll go to the side
 

999
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,390
and they'll go to the side
or behind where you're placing it which

1000
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
or behind where you're placing it which
 

1001
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,549
or behind where you're placing it which
is weird

1002
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
is weird
 

1003
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,470
is weird
but in the past it wasn't an issue

1004
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
but in the past it wasn't an issue
 

1005
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,149
but in the past it wasn't an issue
because

1006
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
because
 

1007
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,990
because
i don't know it's like a bug they

1008
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
i don't know it's like a bug they
 

1009
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,430
i don't know it's like a bug they
introduced

1010
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
introduced
 

1011
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,830
introduced
that they don't know how to fix now so

1012
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
that they don't know how to fix now so
 

1013
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,789
that they don't know how to fix now so
they're just getting rid of the

1014
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
they're just getting rid of the
 

1015
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,390
they're just getting rid of the
collision

1016
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
collision
 

1017
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,710
collision
as a cheap way of fixing it in my

1018
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
as a cheap way of fixing it in my
 

1019
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,590
as a cheap way of fixing it in my
opinion

1020
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600

1085
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,789
wondering what it does so i'll show you
what that does and also we should do a

1086
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
what that does and also we should do a
 

1087
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,230
what that does and also we should do a
slime farm check here

1088
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
slime farm check here
 

1089
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,669

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,110

let's check the corners uh

1092
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
let's check the corners uh
 

1093
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,669
let's check the corners uh
yeah just one slime spawned in that time

1094
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
yeah just one slime spawned in that time
 

1095
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,430
yeah just one slime spawned in that time
so

1096
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440

 

1097
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,590

don't see any drops sitting around
 

1099
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,110
don't see any drops sitting around
anywhere so

1100
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
anywhere so
 

1101
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,510
anywhere so
it's gonna take some time to see how

1102
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
it's gonna take some time to see how
 

1103
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,149
it's gonna take some time to see how
this works

1104
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
this works
 

1105
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,230
this works
i guess

1106
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
