readings all this is ether

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:03,810
readings all this is ether
 

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,990
readings all this is ether
I'm just down here at the end of the

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm just down here at the end of the
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,310
I'm just down here at the end of the
eats road and I was about to add in an

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
eats road and I was about to add in an
 

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,690
eats road and I was about to add in an
elevator thing to the surface

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:17,700

 

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,680

it's really loud and I'm thinking

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:21,690
it's really loud and I'm thinking
 

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,930
it's really loud and I'm thinking
putting it right here so thought you

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:23,940
putting it right here so thought you
 

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,420
putting it right here so thought you
might like to see us so what I'm going

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,430
might like to see us so what I'm going
 

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,089
might like to see us so what I'm going
to do is I'm just gonna think I'm just

16
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,099
to do is I'm just gonna think I'm just
 

17
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,150
to do is I'm just gonna think I'm just
gonna have like half slabs on round

18
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
gonna have like half slabs on round
 

19
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,090
gonna have like half slabs on round
around it

20
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,100

 

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,860

there's gonna be another each road in

22
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:42,870
there's gonna be another each road in
 

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,320
there's gonna be another each road in
front here I think Jesus I want to go

24
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,330
front here I think Jesus I want to go
 

25
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,170
front here I think Jesus I want to go
further

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,180

 

27
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,910

this cell probably replaced with

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:50,920
this cell probably replaced with
 

29
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,450
this cell probably replaced with
sandstone just because I really like

30
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:57,460
sandstone just because I really like
 

31
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,450
sandstone just because I really like
sandstone

32
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,460

 

33
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,370

it's like the brightest block in the

34
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:03,380
it's like the brightest block in the
 

35
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,290
it's like the brightest block in the
game I think that's why I like it's in

36
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,300
game I think that's why I like it's in
 

37
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,880
game I think that's why I like it's in
the default texture pack anyway yeah so

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:11,890
the default texture pack anyway yeah so
 

39
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,670
the default texture pack anyway yeah so
they'll be a boat elevator here

40
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,680
they'll be a boat elevator here
 

41
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,310
they'll be a boat elevator here
right-click to go in the boats and then

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,320
right-click to go in the boats and then
 

43
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,480
right-click to go in the boats and then
automatically you'll start going up to

44
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,490
automatically you'll start going up to
 

45
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,300
automatically you'll start going up to
the surface and then you'll dock is the

46
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,310
the surface and then you'll dock is the
 

47
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,290
the surface and then you'll dock is the
plan not exactly sure how it's all they

48
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,300
plan not exactly sure how it's all they
 

49
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,030
plan not exactly sure how it's all they
don't work

50
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040

 

51
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760

and out of fill this whole shaft up with

52
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:35,770
and out of fill this whole shaft up with
 

53
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,790
and out of fill this whole shaft up with
salted water blocks I'll probably have

54
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:38,800
salted water blocks I'll probably have
 

55
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:53,880
salted water blocks I'll probably have
glass tubing here we place some of it

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:53,890

 

57
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,920

the boat would probably have to be at

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:55,930
the boat would probably have to be at
 

59
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,760
the boat would probably have to be at
this level here for it to be convenient

60
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,770
this level here for it to be convenient
 

61
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:07,590
this level here for it to be convenient
and it's a sunny day outside so no there

62
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
and it's a sunny day outside so no there
 

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,870
and it's a sunny day outside so no there
goes the Sun actually I'll probably have

64
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:12,880
goes the Sun actually I'll probably have
 

65
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,470
goes the Sun actually I'll probably have
a load from this side because now I'm

66
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
a load from this side because now I'm
 

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,810
a load from this side because now I'm
not planning on having a roller on the

68
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:18,820
not planning on having a roller on the
 

69
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,500
not planning on having a roller on the
side for reasons you'll find out later

70
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,510

 

71
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,880

so I'll probably have some sort of easy

72
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,890
so I'll probably have some sort of easy
 

73
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,500
so I'll probably have some sort of easy
loader here and I'll probably hold the

74
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,510
loader here and I'll probably hold the
 

75
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,780
loader here and I'll probably hold the
boat down using trapdoors maybe maybe

76
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:42,790
boat down using trapdoors maybe maybe
 

77
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:56,190
boat down using trapdoors maybe maybe
I'll have a trapdoor right here okay

78
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll have a trapdoor right here okay
 

79
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,940
I'll have a trapdoor right here okay
yeah just like this so the boat will be

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,950
yeah just like this so the boat will be
 

81
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,380
yeah just like this so the boat will be
held underneath it and that will

82
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,390
held underneath it and that will
 

83
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,490
held underneath it and that will
probably mean I need a pressure plate

84
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:07,500
probably mean I need a pressure plate
 

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,050
probably mean I need a pressure plate
underneath as well so that when I hop in

86
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,060
underneath as well so that when I hop in
 

87
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,110
underneath as well so that when I hop in
the boat it activates this trapdoor and

88
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
the boat it activates this trapdoor and
 

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,320
the boat it activates this trapdoor and
opens it I wonder what happens if if I

90
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,330
opens it I wonder what happens if if I
 

91
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,920
opens it I wonder what happens if if I
put it directly beneath if it'll opened

92
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:24,930

 

93
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,850

I'll probably use a stone pressure plate

94
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll probably use a stone pressure plate
 

95
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:38,430
I'll probably use a stone pressure plate
yeah that might work just like that okay

96
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,440
yeah that might work just like that okay
 

97
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,539
yeah that might work just like that okay
well I'm going to work on this a bit and

98
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:39,549
well I'm going to work on this a bit and
 

99
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,500
well I'm going to work on this a bit and
then I'll give you an update all right

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,510
then I'll give you an update all right
 

101
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,850
then I'll give you an update all right
I'm ready to do my first test here so

102
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:47,860
I'm ready to do my first test here so
 

103
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,910
I'm ready to do my first test here so
I'm gonna have an easy loader here it's

104
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm gonna have an easy loader here it's
 

105
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,890
I'm gonna have an easy loader here it's
gonna be the sandwich type so I have to

106
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:52,900
gonna be the sandwich type so I have to
 

107
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,580
gonna be the sandwich type so I have to
use this water pattern

108
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,590
use this water pattern
 

109
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,540
use this water pattern
oh yeah I guess I need some water here

110
00:03:59,540 --> 00:03:59,550
oh yeah I guess I need some water here
 

111
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:11,920
oh yeah I guess I need some water here
for the boat to float on just for now

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:11,930

 

113
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,379

okay so this well we're just testing

114
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,389
okay so this well we're just testing
 

115
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,050
okay so this well we're just testing
this release mechanism right now the EZ

116
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,060
this release mechanism right now the EZ
 

117
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,400
this release mechanism right now the EZ
loaders not actually going to go here

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,410
loaders not actually going to go here
 

119
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,400
loaders not actually going to go here
okay and return the boat returns gonna

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,410
okay and return the boat returns gonna
 

121
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,960
okay and return the boat returns gonna
be above here I think from the surface

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:32,970
be above here I think from the surface
 

123
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,330
be above here I think from the surface
it's all just been try this out I kind

124
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
it's all just been try this out I kind
 

125
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,920
it's all just been try this out I kind
of think I need the pressure plate where

126
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:39,930
of think I need the pressure plate where
 

127
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,550
of think I need the pressure plate where
the water is there oh maybe not that

128
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
the water is there oh maybe not that
 

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,090
the water is there oh maybe not that
works that worked pretty good let's try

130
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,100
works that worked pretty good let's try
 

131
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:06,320
works that worked pretty good let's try
it one more time okay all right so

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,330
it one more time okay all right so
 

133
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,000
it one more time okay all right so
that's the way I'm gonna do it then

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,010
that's the way I'm gonna do it then
 

135
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,610
that's the way I'm gonna do it then
because that works really well so I will

136
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
because that works really well so I will
 

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,159
because that works really well so I will
be back in a bit I'm gonna work on this

138
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,169
be back in a bit I'm gonna work on this
 

139
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,529
be back in a bit I'm gonna work on this
some more well I got the boat elevator

140
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:21,539
some more well I got the boat elevator
 

141
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,920
some more well I got the boat elevator
all done now guys now that it's finished

142
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:24,930
all done now guys now that it's finished
 

143
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,719
all done now guys now that it's finished
I'm thinking maybe I should have made it

144
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:26,729
I'm thinking maybe I should have made it
 

145
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,860
I'm thinking maybe I should have made it
at the oral of it but I don't know it

146
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:30,870
at the oral of it but I don't know it
 

147
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,750
at the oral of it but I don't know it
something everyone's pretty familiar

148
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:32,760
something everyone's pretty familiar
 

149
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,690
something everyone's pretty familiar
with boat elevators have been around for

150
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:35,700
with boat elevators have been around for
 

151
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,960
with boat elevators have been around for
a long time but if you guys want a

152
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:37,970
a long time but if you guys want a
 

153
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,610
a long time but if you guys want a
tutorial just let me know and I'll I'll

154
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
tutorial just let me know and I'll I'll
 

155
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,400
tutorial just let me know and I'll I'll
make one for it it's pretty simple it is

156
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,410
make one for it it's pretty simple it is
 

157
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,129
make one for it it's pretty simple it is
seven by four and you can make it go as

158
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:52,139
seven by four and you can make it go as
 

159
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,219
seven by four and you can make it go as
high as you want

160
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:55,229

 

161
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,260

and let's see so I got like an easy

162
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,270
and let's see so I got like an easy
 

163
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,600
and let's see so I got like an easy

the boat the trapdoor opens and you go
 

181
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,920
the boat the trapdoor opens and you go
up a lot of things like this you need to

up a lot of things like this you need to
 

183
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,860
up a lot of things like this you need to
push a button or a lever or something to

push a button or a lever or something to
 

185
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,679
push a button or a lever or something to
get it going but I've never really been

I'd have a minecart on a pressure plate
 

199
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,089
I'd have a minecart on a pressure plate
when you say on the pressure plates

200
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:02,099
when you say on the pressure plates
 

201
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,300
when you say on the pressure plates
booster would come and push Amaya cart

202
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,310

203
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,469
booster would come and push Amaya cart
that's the way I like to do these things

204
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:07,479
that's the way I like to do these things
 

205
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,369
that's the way I like to do these things
but anyway enough blabbering let's go

223
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,390
hovering on the side of a cliff but the
idea is you add eggs at the boat step on

224
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
idea is you add eggs at the boat step on
 

225

it falls down and resets and if you want

228
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:49,770
it falls down and resets and if you want
 

229
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,830
it falls down and resets and if you want
to go down quickly you can also use this

230
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
to go down quickly you can also use this
 

231
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,770
to go down quickly you can also use this
as a water break boat goes in through

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:01,229
here it's back where it was we can exit
 

235
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,310
here it's back where it was we can exit
through this door here though so pretty

236
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,320
through this door here though so pretty
 

237
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,650
through this door here though so pretty
pretty simple I'll show you how this is

238
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:09,660
pretty simple I'll show you how this is
 

239

loader type you need to use if you got a

242
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
loader type you need to use if you got a
 

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
loader type you need to use if you got a
block directly above the boat when you

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:22,889
block directly above the boat when you
 

245
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,779
block directly above the boat when you
place it so it goes over here I got a

246
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:26,789
place it so it goes over here I got a
 

247
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:38,209
place it so it goes over here I got a
water stream here and this water stream

248
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,219
water stream here and this water stream
 

249
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,680
water stream here and this water stream
goes to a wall and this one pushes it

250
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:42,690
goes to a wall and this one pushes it
 

251
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,160
goes to a wall and this one pushes it
this way so it's pretty hard to see

252
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,170
this way so it's pretty hard to see
 

253
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,610
this way so it's pretty hard to see
sorry about that but it's is you can

254
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:49,620
sorry about that but it's is you can
 

255
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,200
sorry about that but it's is you can
barely see if there's a to wide gap

256
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,210
barely see if there's a to wide gap

pressure plates and the water elevator
 

261
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,890
pressure plates and the water elevator
goes up pretty pretty straightforward

262
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:03,900
goes up pretty pretty straightforward
 

263
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,290
goes up pretty pretty straightforward
stuff but if you want a tutorial just

264
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,300
stuff but if you want a tutorial just
 

265
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,430
stuff but if you want a tutorial just
let me know how we take 15 minutes to

266
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
let me know how we take 15 minutes to
 

267
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,210
let me know how we take 15 minutes to
build or so

268
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,220

 

269
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,679

nice thing about using half-slabs if you

270
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:16,689
nice thing about using half-slabs if you
 

271
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,780
nice thing about using half-slabs if you
do this easy loader tight as you can

272
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,790
do this easy loader tight as you can
 

273
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,679
do this easy loader tight as you can
actually jump out of here but it's a

274
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:22,689
actually jump out of here but it's a
 

275
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:24,660
actually jump out of here but it's a
full block you need a ladder to get out

276
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,670
full block you need a ladder to get out
 

277
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:31,470
full block you need a ladder to get out
if you falling but anyway that's the

278
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,480
if you falling but anyway that's the
 

279
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,720
if you falling but anyway that's the
thing I like it you could also do that

280
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:36,730
thing I like it you could also do that
 

281
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,980
thing I like it you could also do that
water elevator difference

282
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:39,990
water elevator difference
 

283
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,920
water elevator difference
the speedy one with the flowing streams

284
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:43,930
the speedy one with the flowing streams
 

285
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,600
the speedy one with the flowing streams
but that takes more space and takes

286
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:45,610
but that takes more space and takes
 

287
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,509
but that takes more space and takes
longer to build and I've just put

288
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
longer to build and I've just put
 

289
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,999
longer to build and I've just put
sandstone in the corners for looks and

290
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,009

 

291
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:02,569

yeah that's the what new water elevator

292
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:02,579
yeah that's the what new water elevator
 

293
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,329
yeah that's the what new water elevator
and let's head back to the base and work

294
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:06,339
and let's head back to the base and work
 

295
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,670
and let's head back to the base and work
on some other stuff oh yeah just one

296
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
on some other stuff oh yeah just one
 

297
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,860
on some other stuff oh yeah just one
more thing guys if you guys can think of

309
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:28,889
name the things I built just so it's
easier for people to refer to them later

310
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:28,899
easier for people to refer to them later
 

311
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:34,319
easier for people to refer to them later
so I'm drawing a blank if you guys

312
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:34,329
so I'm drawing a blank if you guys
 

313
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,579
so I'm drawing a blank if you guys
didn't think of a name for this let me

314
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:35,589
didn't think of a name for this let me
 

315
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:42,179
didn't think of a name for this let me
know anyway back to the base one thing I

316
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:42,189
know anyway back to the base one thing I
 

317
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,090
know anyway back to the base one thing I
want to give a shout out to someone to

318

want to give a shout out to someone to
 

319
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,710
want to give a shout out to someone to
sell garter I think I said his name

320
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
sell garter I think I said his name
 

321
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,100
