many diamond
 

123
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,309
many diamond
it's two diamond per block with fortune

124
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
it's two diamond per block with fortune
 

125
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,670
it's two diamond per block with fortune
3 that averages out to

126
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
3 that averages out to
 

127
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,110
3 that averages out to
doesn't mean it'll always be like that

128
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
doesn't mean it'll always be like that
 

129
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,589
doesn't mean it'll always be like that
but with this uh test we did that's what

130
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
but with this uh test we did that's what
 

131
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,350
but with this uh test we did that's what
we got

132
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
we got
 

133
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,229

it fluctuates a lot how much you get
from lapis sometimes you get

140
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
from lapis sometimes you get

four stacks and 56 so 256

164
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
four stacks and 56 so 256
 

165

211
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,189

and i'll probably use the old intro that

212
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
and i'll probably use the old intro that
 

213
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,270
and i'll probably use the old intro that
he made me for the lp still

214
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
he made me for the lp still
 

215
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,710
he made me for the lp still
and the new intro maybe for s p

216
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
and the new intro maybe for s p
 

217
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,629
and the new intro maybe for s p
tutorials and other stuff just so it

218
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
tutorials and other stuff just so it
 

219
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,189
tutorials and other stuff just so it
kind of averages out to

220
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
kind of averages out to
 

221
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,550
kind of averages out to
using both of them 50 50 so that there's

222
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
using both of them 50 50 so that there's
 

223
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,870
using both of them 50 50 so that there's
more variety with my intros because uh

224
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
more variety with my intros because uh
 

225
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,310
more variety with my intros because uh
i know a lot of people are kind of

226
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
i know a lot of people are kind of
 

227
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,469
i know a lot of people are kind of
getting bored of the

228
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
getting bored of the

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,909
getting bored of the
oh yeah look at all that redstone

230
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
oh yeah look at all that redstone
 

231
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,629
oh yeah look at all that redstone
of my uh of the other intro even though

232
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
of my uh of the other intro even though
 

233
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,310
of my uh of the other intro even though
it's a really good intro if you see it

234
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
it's a really good intro if you see it
 

235
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,430
it's a really good intro if you see it
100

236
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
100
 

237
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,430
100
over 100 times it might get a little

238
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
over 100 times it might get a little
 

239
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,029
over 100 times it might get a little
boring so

240
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
boring so
 

241
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,629
boring so
if i use it a little bit less from now

242
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
if i use it a little bit less from now
 

243
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,790
if i use it a little bit less from now
on i think people

244
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
on i think people
 

245
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,070
on i think people
will still continue to like it i should

246
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
will still continue to like it i should
 

247
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,749
will still continue to like it i should
say

248
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
say
 

249
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,430
say
okay so i'm gonna do the rest of it here

250
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
okay so i'm gonna do the rest of it here
 

251
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:42,710
okay so i'm gonna do the rest of it here
and i'll be back

252
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720

 

253
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,090

[Applause]
alrighty so this is what we got from all

258
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
alrighty so this is what we got from all
 

259
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,110
alrighty so this is what we got from all
that

260
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
that
 

261
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,189
that
our 16 diamond got turned into 32

262
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
our 16 diamond got turned into 32
 

263
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,510
our 16 diamond got turned into 32
we got let's see we had 115 redstone and

264
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
we got let's see we had 115 redstone and
 

265
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,830
we got let's see we had 115 redstone and
that got turned into

266
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840

 

267
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,350

671 and we had 25

268
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
671 and we had 25
 

269
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,830
671 and we had 25
lapis and that got turned into 312.

270
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
lapis and that got turned into 312.
 

271
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,670
lapis and that got turned into 312.
and this is the coal we had 181 coal

272
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
and this is the coal we had 181 coal
 

273
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,390
and this is the coal we had 181 coal
and with the fortune 3 we got 582

274
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
and with the fortune 3 we got 582
 

275
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,749
and with the fortune 3 we got 582
so i hope i'm pretty sure i got the math

276
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
so i hope i'm pretty sure i got the math
 

277
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,350
so i hope i'm pretty sure i got the math
right on this that works out to

278
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
right on this that works out to
 

279
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,870
right on this that works out to
2.0 for the diamonds per or

280
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
2.0 for the diamonds per or
 

281
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,830
2.0 for the diamonds per or
uh 5.0 five

282
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
uh 5.0 five
 

283
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,830
uh 5.0 five
points 834

284
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
points 834
 

285
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,110
points 834
for the redstone per ore and

286
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
for the redstone per ore and
 

287
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,550
for the redstone per ore and
lapis was 12.48

288
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
lapis was 12.48
 

289
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,110
lapis was 12.48
and finally the coal was

290
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120

 

291
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,110

five 3.2154 not that the last ah

292
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
five 3.2154 not that the last ah
 

293
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,029
five 3.2154 not that the last ah
there we go so that should give you a

294
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
there we go so that should give you a
 

295
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,189
there we go so that should give you a
rough idea of what fortune 3 does with

296
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
rough idea of what fortune 3 does with
 

297
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,469
rough idea of what fortune 3 does with
the oars

298
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
the oars
 

299
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,990
the oars
the diamond here and the lapis we were

300
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
the diamond here and the lapis we were
 

301
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,029
the diamond here and the lapis we were
using a very small

302
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
using a very small
 

303
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,510
using a very small
sample size so it's probably a little

304
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
sample size so it's probably a little
 

305
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,150
sample size so it's probably a little
bit

306
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
bit
 

307
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,189
bit
more inaccurate than the redstone and

308
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
more inaccurate than the redstone and
 

309
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,790
more inaccurate than the redstone and
the coal

310
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
the coal
 

311
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,830
the coal
but yeah it's good to know that

312
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
but yeah it's good to know that
 

313
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,070
but yeah it's good to know that
the averages with fortune 3 uh

314
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
the averages with fortune 3 uh
 

315
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,510
the averages with fortune 3 uh
i have no idea what fortune 1 and

316
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
i have no idea what fortune 1 and
 

317
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,430
i have no idea what fortune 1 and
fortune 2 do in comparison

318
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
fortune 2 do in comparison
 

319
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,950
fortune 2 do in comparison
the wiki says actually i can't remember

320
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
the wiki says actually i can't remember
 

321
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,230
the wiki says actually i can't remember
what the wiki says

322
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
what the wiki says
 

323
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,390
what the wiki says
fortune 3 is supposed to add 120 percent

324
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
fortune 3 is supposed to add 120 percent
 

325
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,790
fortune 3 is supposed to add 120 percent
to your findings but obviously that's uh

326
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
to your findings but obviously that's uh
 

327
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,110
to your findings but obviously that's uh
doesn't seem right to me because you

328
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
doesn't seem right to me because you
 

329
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,189
doesn't seem right to me because you
only get one coal normally and 120

330
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
only get one coal normally and 120
 

331
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,749
only get one coal normally and 120
percent

332
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
percent
 

333
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,830
percent
of like plus 120 percent of one coal is

334
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,189
perfectly
might be a little bit challenging so i

676
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
might be a little bit challenging so i
 

677
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,110
might be a little bit challenging so i
guess

678
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
guess
 

679
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,590
guess
i gotta put pistons around this top row

680
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:28,600
i gotta put pistons around this top row
 

681
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,069
i gotta put pistons around this top row
unfortunately i'll probably work on that

682
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
unfortunately i'll probably work on that
 

683
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,910
unfortunately i'll probably work on that
now

684
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920

 

685
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,430

but they'll they'll come up here

686
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
but they'll they'll come up here
 

687
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,470
but they'll they'll come up here
and i gotta i gotta hook up a crusher

688
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
and i gotta i gotta hook up a crusher
 

689
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,870
and i gotta i gotta hook up a crusher
and i'll probably end up making it so i

690
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
and i'll probably end up making it so i
 

691
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,629
and i'll probably end up making it so i
can punch him to death or also use

692
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
can punch him to death or also use
 

693
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,389
can punch him to death or also use
splash potions to kill

694
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
splash potions to kill
 

695
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,910
splash potions to kill
i think that would be best but i gotta

696
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
i think that would be best but i gotta
 

697
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,910
i think that would be best but i gotta
make it sure i do it so that their stuff

698
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
make it sure i do it so that their stuff
 

699
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,350
make it sure i do it so that their stuff
won't fall

700
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
won't fall
 

701
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,069
won't fall
in this lava below otherwise i'll lose

702
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
in this lava below otherwise i'll lose
 

703
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,470
in this lava below otherwise i'll lose
it all

704
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480

 

705
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,629

so i got that extra layer of pistons

706
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
so i got that extra layer of pistons
 

707
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,470
so i got that extra layer of pistons
added to the top here

708
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
added to the top here
 

709
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,749
added to the top here
there are six per side uh they're done

710
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
there are six per side uh they're done
 

711
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:07,990
there are six per side uh they're done
the

712
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
the
 

713
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,150
the
same way as the ones below this is the

714
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
same way as the ones below this is the
 

715
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,150
same way as the ones below this is the
pressure plate repeater

716
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
pressure plate repeater
 

717
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,870
pressure plate repeater
to block them to the piston and i have

718
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
to block them to the piston and i have
 

719
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,150
to block them to the piston and i have
to put the blocks in front of the

720
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
to put the blocks in front of the
 

721
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,990
to put the blocks in front of the
pistons yet i just wanted to show you

722
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
pistons yet i just wanted to show you
 

723
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,030
pistons yet i just wanted to show you
before

724
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
before
 

725
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,949
before
i did so you can see it

726
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
i did so you can see it
 

727
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,470
i did so you can see it
so when the blaze spawn up here they'll

728
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
so when the blaze spawn up here they'll
 

729
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,990
so when the blaze spawn up here they'll
get pushed down

730
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
get pushed down
 

731
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,790
get pushed down
uh the pistons blows get activated too

732
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
uh the pistons blows get activated too
 

733
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,080
uh the pistons blows get activated too
because uh they're directly below

734
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,090
because uh they're directly below
 

735
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,310

the pressure plates are diagonal to the

738
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
the pressure plates are diagonal to the
 

739
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
the pressure plates are diagonal to the
pressure plates and they get updated

740
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
pressure plates and they get updated
 

741
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,670
pressure plates and they get updated
it doesn't have much of an effect though

742
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
it doesn't have much of an effect though
 

743
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,670
it doesn't have much of an effect though
and i also got rid of the signs because

744
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
and i also got rid of the signs because
 

745
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,030
and i also got rid of the signs because
they no longer did anything

746
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
they no longer did anything
 

747
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,389
they no longer did anything
so no need for them so we're going to

748
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
so no need for them so we're going to
 

749
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,670
so no need for them so we're going to
put the blocks on

750
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
put the blocks on
 

751
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,110
put the blocks on
and we're going to give it another try

752
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
and we're going to give it another try
 

753
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,110
and we're going to give it another try
and be very careful i don't get pushed

754
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
and be very careful i don't get pushed
 

755
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,870
and be very careful i don't get pushed
here

756
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880

 

757
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,069

all right you get the idea

758
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
all right you get the idea
 

759
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,710
all right you get the idea
so i am a little bit sad about uh

760
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720

 

761
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,990

these pistons are blocking uh the

762
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
these pistons are blocking uh the
 

763
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,069
these pistons are blocking uh the
blaze farm here a little bit i really

764
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
blaze farm here a little bit i really
 

765
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,590
blaze farm here a little bit i really
like the way it looked before

766
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
like the way it looked before
 

767
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,429
like the way it looked before
and now um we got all these pistons in

768
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
and now um we got all these pistons in
 

769
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,710
and now um we got all these pistons in
the way

770
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
the way
 

771
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,630
the way
of the viewing area i may actually get

772
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
of the viewing area i may actually get
 

773
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,669
of the viewing area i may actually get
rid of the ones

774
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
rid of the ones
 

775
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,870
rid of the ones
on this side only which would lower the

776
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
on this side only which would lower the
 

777
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,470
on this side only which would lower the
efficiency a little bit but i don't

778
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
efficiency a little bit but i don't
 

779
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,630
efficiency a little bit but i don't
think it'll have much impact

780
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
think it'll have much impact
 

781
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,270
think it'll have much impact
just as long as i don't have more than

782
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
just as long as i don't have more than
 

783
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,230
just as long as i don't have more than
two blaze

784
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
two blaze
 

785
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,510
two blaze
up here within range of the spawner oh i

786
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
up here within range of the spawner oh i
 

787
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,390
up here within range of the spawner oh i
did it

788
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
did it
 

789
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,070
did it
i can't believe i did it all right

790
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
i can't believe i did it all right
 

791
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,150
i can't believe i did it all right
quick quick

792
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160

 

793
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,800

that was scary

794
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:49,810
that was scary
 

795
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,470

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
he's override it it's about the only
 

799
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,830
he's override it it's about the only
time we'll get to

800
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840

 

801
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,510

um what was i talking about

802
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
um what was i talking about
 

803
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,950
um what was i talking about
yeah i might get rid of that one side

804
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
yeah i might get rid of that one side
 

805
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,590
yeah i might get rid of that one side
just so we can

806
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
just so we can
 

807
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,390
just so we can
uh view it a little bit better let me

808
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
uh view it a little bit better let me
 

809
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,310
uh view it a little bit better let me
out of here

810
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
out of here
 

811
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,590
out of here
because originally i intended of sort of

812
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
because originally i intended of sort of
 

813
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,190
because originally i intended of sort of
having this is an area where you would

814
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
having this is an area where you would
 

815
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,950
having this is an area where you would
be quite often

816
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
be quite often
 

817
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,270
be quite often
and you could clearly see the blaze

818
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
and you could clearly see the blaze
 

819
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,870
and you could clearly see the blaze
spawning inside

820
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
spawning inside
 

821
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,630
spawning inside
and it looks cool with the lava coming

822
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
and it looks cool with the lava coming
 

823
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,230
and it looks cool with the lava coming
down and then below you can see the

824
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
down and then below you can see the
 

825
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,230
down and then below you can see the
conveyor belt which also looks really

826
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
conveyor belt which also looks really
 

827
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,510
conveyor belt which also looks really
cool

828
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
cool
 

829
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,150
cool
and i want to try to keep that look if i

830
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
and i want to try to keep that look if i
 

831
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,630
and i want to try to keep that look if i
can

832
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
can
 

833
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,350
can
so i may just get rid of this one side

834
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
so i may just get rid of this one side
 

835
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,549
so i may just get rid of this one side
uh i'm gonna finish this up i guess it

836
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
uh i'm gonna finish this up i guess it
 

837
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,310
uh i'm gonna finish this up i guess it
is finished right

838
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
is finished right
 

839
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,669
is finished right
yeah so we'll block it off and then we

840
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
yeah so we'll block it off and then we
 

841
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,710
yeah so we'll block it off and then we
will

842
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
will
 

843
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,310
will
let them spawn again and see what

844

we had a lot of fun doing that

864
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
we had a lot of fun doing that
 

865
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,470
we had a lot of fun doing that
just happened we didn't really plan on

866
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
just happened we didn't really plan on
 

867
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,230
just happened we didn't really plan on
playing that we just

868
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240

playing that we just
started and we couldn't stop it was so

870
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
started and we couldn't stop it was so
 

871
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,590
started and we couldn't stop it was so
much fun

872
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
much fun
 

873
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,070
much fun
we actually played it for about it was

874
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
we actually played it for about it was
 

875
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,950
we actually played it for about it was
between two or three hours but i edited

876
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
between two or three hours but i edited
 

877
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,029
between two or three hours but i edited
the footage down to

878
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039

 

879
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,070

um just under an hour there

880
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
um just under an hour there
 

881
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,789
um just under an hour there
all right now that's working and i left

882
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
all right now that's working and i left
 

883
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,510
all right now that's working and i left
this open

884
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
this open
 

885
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,870
this open
so i should probably close that

886
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880

 

887
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,630

now i i was playing around with this

888
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
now i i was playing around with this
 

889
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,789
now i i was playing around with this
before and i know i never showed this

890
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
before and i know i never showed this
 

891
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,230
before and i know i never showed this
but i don't know if it's set up at the

892
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
but i don't know if it's set up at the
 

893
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,710
but i don't know if it's set up at the
moment

894
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
moment
 

895
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,029
moment
like i said i haven't been here in weeks

896
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
like i said i haven't been here in weeks
 

897
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,110
like i said i haven't been here in weeks
but i think what i was trying to do

898
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
but i think what i was trying to do
 

899
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,430
but i think what i was trying to do
here is uh cut the lava

900
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
here is uh cut the lava
 

901
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,549
here is uh cut the lava
oh right they fall down

902
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
oh right they fall down
 

903
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,909
oh right they fall down
i was having trouble with this i

904
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
i was having trouble with this i
 

905
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,190
i was having trouble with this i
remember so i have to activate the lower

906
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
remember so i have to activate the lower
 

907
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,789
remember so i have to activate the lower
one

908
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
one
 

909
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,270
one
and the upper one and then

910
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
and the upper one and then
 

911
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:29,430
and the upper one and then
now they're now they're up so

912
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440

 

913
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,830

yeah because we gotta get them in that

914
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
yeah because we gotta get them in that
 

915
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,510
yeah because we gotta get them in that
holding area

916
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
holding area
 

917
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,190
holding area
if we don't have lava though they won't

918
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
if we don't have lava though they won't
 

919
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,549
if we don't have lava though they won't
swim up

920
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
swim up
 

921
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,070
swim up
and if we do have lava the items will

922
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
and if we do have lava the items will
 

923
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,710
and if we do have lava the items will
drop in it so we need to get them up

924
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
drop in it so we need to get them up
 

925
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,909
drop in it so we need to get them up
and get rid of the lava

926
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
and get rid of the lava
 

927
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,430
and get rid of the lava
so that seems to be

928
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
so that seems to be
 

929
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,290
so that seems to be
working okay

930
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,300
working okay
 

931
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,750
working okay
[Music]

932
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
[Music]
 

933
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,909
[Music]
and then any extra that come we'll just

934
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
and then any extra that come we'll just
 

935
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,990
and then any extra that come we'll just
wait down there and stay separate from

936
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
wait down there and stay separate from
 

937
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,789
wait down there and stay separate from
the ones we

938
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
the ones we
 

939
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,590
the ones we
crush here and then we can kill them and

940
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
crush here and then we can kill them and
 

941
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:01,990
crush here and then we can kill them and
then let

942
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
then let
 

943
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,590
then let
the other ones up by root

944
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
the other ones up by root
 

945
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,870
the other ones up by root
by doing that

946
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
by doing that
 

947
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,110
by doing that
yeah so this might be set up already

948
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120

 

949
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,630

pretty good okay

950
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640

 

951
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,390

yeah it's really hmm

952
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
yeah it's really hmm
 

953
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:32,230
yeah it's really hmm
it's really jamming up the conveyor

954
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240

 

955
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,830

um just watching it a little bit here

956
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840

 

957
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,549

it's it's only jams up if there there's

958
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
it's it's only jams up if there there's
 

959
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,470
it's it's only jams up if there there's
a bunch of them at once otherwise it's

960
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
a bunch of them at once otherwise it's
 

961
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,590
a bunch of them at once otherwise it's
fine

962
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600

 

963
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,110

all right well i'll watch it a little

964
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
all right well i'll watch it a little
 

965
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,870
all right well i'll watch it a little
bit more off camera here

966
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
bit more off camera here
 

967
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:10,830
bit more off camera here
get a better idea of things

968
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840

 

969
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,029

okay

970
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
okay
 

971
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,870
okay
yeah so i just remembered another

972
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
yeah so i just remembered another
 

973
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,789
yeah so i just remembered another
problem i was having with this

974
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
problem i was having with this
 

975
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,070
problem i was having with this
before um if i

976
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
before um if i
 

977
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,830
before um if i
do it the way i have it set up now

978
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
do it the way i have it set up now
 

979
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,669
do it the way i have it set up now
there's an issue where their feet can

980
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
there's an issue where their feet can
 

981
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,950
there's an issue where their feet can
get stuck

982
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
get stuck
 

983
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,549
get stuck
in that block that just extended

984
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
in that block that just extended
 

985
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,470
in that block that just extended
that happens if they're not jumping

986
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
that happens if they're not jumping
 

987
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,590
that happens if they're not jumping
so that's a problem because

988
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
so that's a problem because
 

989
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,070
so that's a problem because
if we try to crush them they're going to

990
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
if we try to crush them they're going to
 

991
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,830
if we try to crush them they're going to
be one block too low and they won't take

992
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
be one block too low and they won't take
 

993
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,870
be one block too low and they won't take
any

994
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
any
 

995
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,870
any
suffocation damage

996
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880

 

997
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,549

um also there's no lava below because we

998
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
um also there's no lava below because we
 

999
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,390
um also there's no lava below because we
cut it off but

1000
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
cut it off but
 

1001
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,390
cut it off but
we can fix that by having a second lava

1002
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
we can fix that by having a second lava
 

1003
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,630
we can fix that by having a second lava
source just below the pistons

1004
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
source just below the pistons
 

1005
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,950
source just below the pistons
so that they'll continue to swim up even

1006
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960
so that they'll continue to swim up even
 

1007
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,870
so that they'll continue to swim up even
when it's cut off like this

1008
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
when it's cut off like this
 

1009
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,149
when it's cut off like this
that's not a big deal but i think what i

1010
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
that's not a big deal but i think what i
 

1011
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,070
that's not a big deal but i think what i
want to try

1012
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
want to try
 

1013
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,470
want to try
is replace this block with a half slab

1014
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
is replace this block with a half slab
 

1015
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,110
is replace this block with a half slab
and then put another half slab just

1016
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
and then put another half slab just
 

1017
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,110
and then put another half slab just
below this one

1018
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
below this one
 

1019
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,789
below this one
like on top and then

1020
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
like on top and then
 

1021
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,549
like on top and then
uh use try see if

1022
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
uh use try see if
 

1023
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,750
uh use try see if
this block extending out will crush them

1024
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:25,760
this block extending out will crush them
 

1025
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,750
this block extending out will crush them
so they'll be half of half a block

1026
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
so they'll be half of half a block
 

1027
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,950
so they'll be half of half a block
below this one and their head will be

1028
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
below this one and their head will be
 

1029
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,510
below this one and their head will be
half a block above and then

1030
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
half a block above and then
 

1031
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,430
half a block above and then
i don't know if that causes suffocation

1032
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
i don't know if that causes suffocation
 

1033
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,950
i don't know if that causes suffocation
damage we'll see

1034
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
damage we'll see
 

1035
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,269
damage we'll see
so i'm gonna get rid of these guys and

1036
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
so i'm gonna get rid of these guys and
 

1037
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:47,669
so i'm gonna get rid of these guys and
we'll try it out

1038
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679

 

1039
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,149

all right let's see how this works so

1040
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
all right let's see how this works so
 

1041
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,430
all right let's see how this works so
we're just going to extend

1042
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
we're just going to extend
 

1043
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,310
we're just going to extend
this half slab should push them up

1044
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320

 

1045
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,830

nope no it's too bad

1046
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840

 

1047
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,750

um

1048
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760

 

1049
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,710

let's try it again

1050
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720

 

1051
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,909

yeah all right we'll have to do

1052
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
yeah all right we'll have to do
 

1053
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,149
yeah all right we'll have to do
something else then

1054
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
something else then
 

1055
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,750
something else then
uh i'm gonna extend that glass

1056
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
uh i'm gonna extend that glass
 

1057
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,230
uh i'm gonna extend that glass
it'll definitely work if we extend that

1058
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
it'll definitely work if we extend that
 

1059
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,029
it'll definitely work if we extend that
first

1060
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
first
 

1061
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,029
first
i was hoping to do this with two pistons

1062
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
i was hoping to do this with two pistons
 

1063
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,470
i was hoping to do this with two pistons
though instead of three

1064
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
though instead of three
 

1065
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,390
though instead of three
and now i just want to see if this

1066
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
and now i just want to see if this
 

1067
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,470
and now i just want to see if this
crushes them so we do have a half slab

1068
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
crushes them so we do have a half slab
 

1069
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,350
crushes them so we do have a half slab
of

1070
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
of
 

1071
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,830
of
over there and that there's one there

1072
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
over there and that there's one there
 

1073
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,350
over there and that there's one there
and finally yeah

1074
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
and finally yeah
 

1075
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,909
and finally yeah
are they all getting crushed no i don't

1076
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
are they all getting crushed no i don't
 

1077
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,710
are they all getting crushed no i don't
think they are

1078
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720

 

1079
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,990

that's very weird

1080
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
that's very weird
 

1081
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,430
that's very weird
it's happening like one after another

1082
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
it's happening like one after another
 

1083
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,630
it's happening like one after another
instead of all at once

1084
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640

 

1085
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,390

that is really weird

1086
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400

 

1087
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,630

i wonder why it's doing that

1088
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640

 

1089
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,549

all right so that setup won't work uh

1090
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
all right so that setup won't work uh
 

1091
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,029
all right so that setup won't work uh
i guess i'll continue to play with this

1092
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
i guess i'll continue to play with this
 

1093
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,470
i guess i'll continue to play with this
some more off camera

1094
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
some more off camera
 

1095
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,470
some more off camera
it's getting very late here though so i

1096
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
it's getting very late here though so i
 

1097
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,909
it's getting very late here though so i
will call it an

1098
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
will call it an
 

1099
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,870
will call it an
end for today uh we might work on this

1100
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
end for today uh we might work on this
 

1101
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,029
end for today uh we might work on this
some more next episode

1102
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
some more next episode
 

1103
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,390
some more next episode
uh we probably will and hopefully we'll

1104
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
uh we probably will and hopefully we'll
 

1105
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,630
uh we probably will and hopefully we'll
finally get it up and running

1106
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
finally get it up and running
 

1107
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,710
finally get it up and running
and i gotta transfer those pistons over

1108
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
and i gotta transfer those pistons over
 

1109
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,669
and i gotta transfer those pistons over
to that side

1110
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
to that side
 

1111
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,950
to that side
and i'll probably get rid of this one

1112
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
and i'll probably get rid of this one
 

1113
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,870
and i'll probably get rid of this one
side of them like i said just for

1114
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
side of them like i said just for
 

1115
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,269
side of them like i said just for
a better view and then i gotta

1116
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
a better view and then i gotta
 

1117
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,470
a better view and then i gotta
fix this holding area up i could just

1118
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
fix this holding area up i could just
 

1119
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,549
fix this holding area up i could just
have it down below but i i want it up

1120
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
have it down below but i i want it up
 

1121
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,830
have it down below but i i want it up
high just for

1122
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
high just for
 

1123
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,470
high just for
the looks of it and this will be like

1124
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
the looks of it and this will be like
 

1125
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,470
the looks of it and this will be like
the main floor over here

1126
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
the main floor over here
 

1127
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,549
the main floor over here
i plan on doing another one of these

1128
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
i plan on doing another one of these
 

1129
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,990
i plan on doing another one of these
like holding areas

1130
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
like holding areas
 

1131
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,029
like holding areas
on this side and that will be for zombie

1132
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
on this side and that will be for zombie
 

1133
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,390
on this side and that will be for zombie
pigmen i'm gonna make a little farm for

pigmen i'm gonna make a little farm for
 

1135
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,149

them it won't be super efficient or

1136
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
them it won't be super efficient or
 

1137
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,430
