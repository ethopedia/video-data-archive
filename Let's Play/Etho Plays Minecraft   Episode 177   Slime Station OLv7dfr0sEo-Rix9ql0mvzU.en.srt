if it's over there it's kind of

158
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
if it's over there it's kind of
 

159
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,990
if it's over there it's kind of
symmetrical with this because it's in

160
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
symmetrical with this because it's in
 

161
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,710
symmetrical with this because it's in
the middle

162
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
the middle
 

163
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,830
the middle
of these three blocks but it is also

164
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
of these three blocks but it is also
 

165
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,390
of these three blocks but it is also
harder to see

166
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400

 

167
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,509

yeah i think i'll do it over here

168
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519

 

169
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,870

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200

 

509
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,870

all right well not the most impressive

510
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
all right well not the most impressive
 

511
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,710
all right well not the most impressive
sight but it's better than just the flat

512
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
sight but it's better than just the flat
 

513
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,710
sight but it's better than just the flat
wall i guess

514
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
wall i guess
 

515
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,949
wall i guess
um okay let's try this

516
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
um okay let's try this
 

517
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,590
um okay let's try this
so when the cart goes down it'll go up

518
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
so when the cart goes down it'll go up
 

519
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,710
so when the cart goes down it'll go up
pick up a slime

520
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720

 

521
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,509

oh it just barely made it up that slope

522
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
oh it just barely made it up that slope
 

523
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,269
oh it just barely made it up that slope
that scares me a little bit

524
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279

 

525
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:35,190

let's try this again

526
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200

 

527
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,310

good so that motion is really important

528
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
good so that motion is really important
 

529
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,829
good so that motion is really important
for picking up the slimes

530
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
for picking up the slimes
 

531
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,949
for picking up the slimes
we can't have the cart stop here

532
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
we can't have the cart stop here
 

533
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,230
we can't have the cart stop here
and wait we need it to be moving uh

534
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
and wait we need it to be moving uh
 

535
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,670
and wait we need it to be moving uh
then what we need to happen is it go off

536
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
then what we need to happen is it go off
 

537
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,430
then what we need to happen is it go off
another direction we don't want to go

538
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
another direction we don't want to go
 

539
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,670
another direction we don't want to go
back there we want it to go

540
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
back there we want it to go
 

541
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,710
back there we want it to go
like this way maybe

542
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
like this way maybe
 

543
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,310
like this way maybe
so how's this gonna work if we put a

544
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
so how's this gonna work if we put a
 

545
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,310
so how's this gonna work if we put a
lever here

546
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
lever here
 

547
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,670
lever here
unpowered goes that way and power goes

548
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
unpowered goes that way and power goes
 

549
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,910
unpowered goes that way and power goes
that way

550
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920

 

551
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,190

okay so if we put a detector rail

552
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
okay so if we put a detector rail
 

553
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,790
okay so if we put a detector rail
here that might do the trick

554
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800

 

555
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,710

i might yeah if it's going slow like

556
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
i might yeah if it's going slow like
 

557
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,470
i might yeah if it's going slow like
that that might actually work out better

558
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480

 

559
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,190

let's see if it'll auto switch for us

560
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200

 

561
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,829

oh beautiful just beautiful that's

562
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
oh beautiful just beautiful that's
 

563
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,350
oh beautiful just beautiful that's
exactly what we want

564
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
exactly what we want
 

565
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,430
exactly what we want
i'm pretty sure i should hop into the

566
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
i'm pretty sure i should hop into the
 

567
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,949
i'm pretty sure i should hop into the
cart just

568
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
cart just
 

569
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,030
cart just
to mimic what it would be like if a

570
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
to mimic what it would be like if a
 

571
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,150
to mimic what it would be like if a
slime

572
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
slime
 

573
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,509
slime
the slime entered it there though

574
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
the slime entered it there though
 

575
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,949
the slime entered it there though
because the cart will move a little bit

576
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
because the cart will move a little bit
 

577
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,190
because the cart will move a little bit
quicker

578
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
quicker
 

579
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,870
quicker
okay so it still went that direction

580
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
okay so it still went that direction
 

581
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,030
okay so it still went that direction
that's good

582
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
that's good
 

583
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,069
that's good
oh that is very nice very compact the

584
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
oh that is very nice very compact the
 

585
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,150
oh that is very nice very compact the
way this wiring is here

586
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
way this wiring is here
 

587
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,150
way this wiring is here
uh this repeater

588
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
uh this repeater
 

589
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,230
uh this repeater
beyond this repeater the wire splits two

590
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
beyond this repeater the wire splits two
 

591
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,069
beyond this repeater the wire splits two
directions so that

592
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
directions so that
 

593
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,389
directions so that
there's one wire oop there's a wire

594
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
there's one wire oop there's a wire
 

595
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,430
there's one wire oop there's a wire
there and a wire behind there

596
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440

 

597
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,790

right this wire goes to this block

598
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
right this wire goes to this block
 

599
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,350
right this wire goes to this block
and there is a redstone torch there that

600
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
and there is a redstone torch there that
 

601
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,509
and there is a redstone torch there that
goes up to the trap door

602
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
goes up to the trap door
 

603
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,829
goes up to the trap door
and also behind the block is a wire

604
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
and also behind the block is a wire
 

605
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,430
and also behind the block is a wire
which goes

606
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
which goes
 

607
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,509
which goes
to that block and to the trapdoor as

608
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
to that block and to the trapdoor as
 

609
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,470
to that block and to the trapdoor as
well

610
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
well
 

611
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,629
well
and that makes its open close real quick

612
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
and that makes its open close real quick
 

613
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,829
and that makes its open close real quick
but what i want to try i gotta make sure

614
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
but what i want to try i gotta make sure
 

615
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,829
but what i want to try i gotta make sure
this works too because what's going to

616
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
this works too because what's going to
 

617
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,949
this works too because what's going to
happen is

618
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
happen is
 

619
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,269
happen is
slime's going to land over there and

620
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
slime's going to land over there and
 

621
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,350
slime's going to land over there and
he's going to hit pressure plates

622
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
he's going to hit pressure plates
 

623
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
he's going to hit pressure plates
so he might be on that pressure plate

624
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
so he might be on that pressure plate
 

625
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,189
so he might be on that pressure plate
for a while so we want to mimic

626
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
for a while so we want to mimic
 

627
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,790
for a while so we want to mimic
oh i said that quick mimic a long pulse

628
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
oh i said that quick mimic a long pulse
 

629
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,910
oh i said that quick mimic a long pulse
on this

630
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920

 

631
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,269

okay so look we need an on off for it to

632
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
okay so look we need an on off for it to
 

633
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,829
okay so look we need an on off for it to
work

634
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

 

635
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,269

hmm

636
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
hmm
 

637
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,389
hmm
okay i'll have to think about that a bit

638
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399

 

639
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,790

yeah so this monostable circuit here

640
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
yeah so this monostable circuit here
 

641
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,710
yeah so this monostable circuit here
activates on the off states

642
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
activates on the off states
 

643
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,310
activates on the off states
of the circuit so that's on

644
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
of the circuit so that's on
 

645
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,509
of the circuit so that's on
that's off so i went and built another

646
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
that's off so i went and built another
 

647
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,910
that's off so i went and built another
monostable circuit i know this one

648
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
monostable circuit i know this one
 

649
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,030
monostable circuit i know this one
activates

650
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
activates
 

651
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,230
activates
on the on on

652
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
on the on on
 

653
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,269
on the on on
off on off

654
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
off on off
 

655
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,430
off on off
on off

656
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440

 

657
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,150

so it's it's the reverse and i think the

658
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
so it's it's the reverse and i think the
 

659
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,670
so it's it's the reverse and i think the
reason is because this one has two

660
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
reason is because this one has two
 

661
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,870
reason is because this one has two
redstone torches

662
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
redstone torches
 

663
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,269
redstone torches
and this one only has one so we can

664
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
and this one only has one so we can
 

665
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,389
and this one only has one so we can
probably fix it

666
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
probably fix it
 

667
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,829
probably fix it
just by putting another

668
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
just by putting another
 

669
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,470
just by putting another
redstone torch in the circuit is what

670
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
redstone torch in the circuit is what
 

671
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,870
redstone torch in the circuit is what
i'm

672
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
i'm
 

673
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,230
i'm
guessing so now

674
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240

 

675
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,590

yeah that was on off on

676
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
yeah that was on off on
 

677
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,990
yeah that was on off on
off so that's what we want so we'll need

678
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
off so that's what we want so we'll need
 

679
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,470
off so that's what we want so we'll need
to put in another redstone torch

680
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
to put in another redstone torch
 

681
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,069
to put in another redstone torch
before the repeater or else

682
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
before the repeater or else
 

683
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,550
before the repeater or else
just get rid of that wiring and put in

684
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
just get rid of that wiring and put in
 

685
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,829
just get rid of that wiring and put in
one of these instead

686
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
one of these instead
 

687
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,949
one of these instead
maybe

688
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
maybe
 

689
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,310
maybe
aha look what we caught this is perfect

690
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
aha look what we caught this is perfect
 

691
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,430
aha look what we caught this is perfect
we'll be able to

692
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
we'll be able to
 

693
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,389
we'll be able to
try this out make sure it works because

694
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
try this out make sure it works because
 

695
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,870
try this out make sure it works because
i haven't really done that properly yet

696
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
i haven't really done that properly yet
 

697
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,990
i haven't really done that properly yet
okay do i have enough yeah i have the

698
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
okay do i have enough yeah i have the
 

699
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,350
okay do i have enough yeah i have the
other one on me

700
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
other one on me
 

701
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,110
other one on me
may as well put it in make sure

702
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120

 

703
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,110

uh the slime doesn't bump the carts or

704
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
uh the slime doesn't bump the carts or
 

705
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,189
uh the slime doesn't bump the carts or
something crazy

706
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
something crazy
 

707
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,069
something crazy
and

708
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079

 

709
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,670

awesome so he can take a little bit of

710
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
awesome so he can take a little bit of
 

711
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,790
awesome so he can take a little bit of
damage

712
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
damage
 

713
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,030
damage
uh if he passes through blocks but we

714
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
uh if he passes through blocks but we
 

715
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,870
uh if he passes through blocks but we
don't want

716
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
don't want
 

717
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,870
don't want
him to suffocate obviously before he

718
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
him to suffocate obviously before he
 

719
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,629
him to suffocate obviously before he
gets to his destination

720
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639

 

721
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,389

the rise will split and make a mess and

722
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
the rise will split and make a mess and
 

723
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,550
the rise will split and make a mess and
so yeah i guess i should probably

724
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
so yeah i guess i should probably
 

725
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,949
so yeah i guess i should probably
explain what this is all for because i'm

726
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
explain what this is all for because i'm
 

727
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,870
explain what this is all for because i'm
sure there's some newer subscribers that

728
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
sure there's some newer subscribers that
 

729
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,350
sure there's some newer subscribers that
don't know what we're doing

730
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
don't know what we're doing
 

731
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,509
don't know what we're doing
uh there is a track i i have underneath

732
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
uh there is a track i i have underneath
 

733
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,749
uh there is a track i i have underneath
the tree farm here goes all the way

734
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
the tree farm here goes all the way
 

735
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,790
the tree farm here goes all the way
around

736
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
around
 

737
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,870
around
and loops it keeps looping around and

738
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
and loops it keeps looping around and
 

739
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,670
and loops it keeps looping around and
around and around

740
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
around and around
 

741
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,629
around and around
the goal is to get big slimes into carts

742
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
the goal is to get big slimes into carts
 

743
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,069
the goal is to get big slimes into carts
underneath here

744
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
underneath here
 

745
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,069
underneath here
and their heads poke out a little bit

746
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
and their heads poke out a little bit
 

747
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,230
and their heads poke out a little bit
through these half slabs

748
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
through these half slabs
 

749
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,470
through these half slabs
the half slabs don't suffocate them so

750
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
the half slabs don't suffocate them so
 

751
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,910
the half slabs don't suffocate them so
they just keep going around it looks

752
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
they just keep going around it looks
 

753
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,949
they just keep going around it looks
really cool

754
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
really cool
 

755
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,590
really cool
it's all for fun and giggles

756
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600

 

757
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,790

no real purpose to it uh

758
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
no real purpose to it uh
 

759
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,230
no real purpose to it uh
except except for the fun of it

760
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
except except for the fun of it
 

761
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,350
except except for the fun of it
and let's see

762
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
and let's see
 

763
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,189
and let's see
so that worked out pretty good we need

764
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
so that worked out pretty good we need
 

765
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,949
so that worked out pretty good we need
to hook this

766
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
to hook this
 

767
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,670
to hook this
this is the empty cart collection track

768
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
this is the empty cart collection track
 

769
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,790
this is the empty cart collection track
here

770
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
here
 

771
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,829
here
and this is the one for sending off the

772
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
and this is the one for sending off the
 

773
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,549
and this is the one for sending off the
slimes

774
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
slimes
 

775
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,230
slimes
so we'll have to hook both of these up

776
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
so we'll have to hook both of these up
 

777
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,630
so we'll have to hook both of these up
to that loop

778
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
to that loop
 

779
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,829
to that loop
um i'm going to grab some stuff and

780
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
um i'm going to grab some stuff and
 

781
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,309
um i'm going to grab some stuff and
we'll

782
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
we'll
 

783
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,150
we'll
we'll get going here again

784
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160

 

785
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,549

the next thing we're gonna do here is

786
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
the next thing we're gonna do here is
 

787
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,029
the next thing we're gonna do here is
hook up our slime detector so let's get

788
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
hook up our slime detector so let's get
 

789
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,110
hook up our slime detector so let's get
rid of this water

790
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
rid of this water
 

791
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,829
rid of this water
uh i think i'll put a pressure plate in

792
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
uh i think i'll put a pressure plate in
 

793
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,789
uh i think i'll put a pressure plate in
the middle of this

794
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
the middle of this
 

795
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,470
the middle of this
just for the symmetry of it

796
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
just for the symmetry of it
 

797
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,350
just for the symmetry of it
um i might get rid of that stone brick

798
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
um i might get rid of that stone brick
 

799
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,710
um i might get rid of that stone brick
later i don't know

800
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
later i don't know
 

801
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,789
later i don't know
what block to use doesn't really matter

802
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
what block to use doesn't really matter
 

803
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,549
what block to use doesn't really matter
because the pressure plate's gonna

804
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
because the pressure plate's gonna
 

805
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,430
because the pressure plate's gonna
block most of the block block most of

806
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
block most of the block block most of
 

807
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,270
block most of the block block most of
the block texture

808
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
the block texture
 

809
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,789
the block texture
that made sense uh

810
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
that made sense uh
 

811
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,470
that made sense uh
does that still work yet so it still

812
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
does that still work yet so it still
 

813
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,390
does that still work yet so it still
pushes them to

814
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
pushes them to
 

815
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,950
pushes them to
this corner all right so

816
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
this corner all right so
 

817
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,710
this corner all right so
if there is a slime in here they will

818
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
if there is a slime in here they will
 

819
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,190
if there is a slime in here they will
always be on this pressure plate

820
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
always be on this pressure plate
 

821
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,789
always be on this pressure plate
no matter where they are in this three

822
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
no matter where they are in this three
 

823
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,669
no matter where they are in this three
by three area

824
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
by three area
 

825
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,029
by three area
and i'm sorry grass

826
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
and i'm sorry grass
 

827
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,789
and i'm sorry grass
we'll have to go underneath here now

828
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
we'll have to go underneath here now
 

829
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,470
we'll have to go underneath here now
so it's right there we're gonna hook

830
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
so it's right there we're gonna hook
 

831
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,070
so it's right there we're gonna hook
that up to an rs nor latch

832
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
that up to an rs nor latch
 

833
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,909
that up to an rs nor latch
actually is this wire in the way here i

834
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
actually is this wire in the way here i
 

835
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,110
actually is this wire in the way here i
hope not

836
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120

 

837
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,190

uh yeah rs nor latch we'll go right

838
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
uh yeah rs nor latch we'll go right
 

839
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,430
uh yeah rs nor latch we'll go right
let's see where is this right here

840
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440

 

841
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,390

like that um

842
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
like that um
 

843
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,510
like that um
yeah and

844
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
yeah and
 

845
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,350
yeah and
i think we really need to use an rs nor

846
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
i think we really need to use an rs nor
 

847
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,789
i think we really need to use an rs nor
latch like we can't just hook that

848
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
latch like we can't just hook that
 

849
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,190
latch like we can't just hook that
pressure plate up to the cart system

850
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
pressure plate up to the cart system
 

851
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,230
pressure plate up to the cart system
the pez dispenser because what happens

852
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
the pez dispenser because what happens
 

853
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,230
the pez dispenser because what happens
if two slimes

854
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
if two slimes
 

855
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,190
if two slimes
are in that area or they come in close

856
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
are in that area or they come in close
 

857
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,230
are in that area or they come in close
uh

858
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
uh
 

859
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,029
uh
if they arrive at close times together

860
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
if they arrive at close times together
 

861
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,150
if they arrive at close times together
it's not gonna work

862
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
it's not gonna work
 

863
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,510
it's not gonna work
because if the cart picks up one slime

864
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
because if the cart picks up one slime
 

865
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,870
because if the cart picks up one slime
there'll still be another slime on the

866
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
there'll still be another slime on the
 

867
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,390
there'll still be another slime on the
pressure plate and it will never get

868
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
pressure plate and it will never get
 

869
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,669
pressure plate and it will never get
that off

870
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
that off
 

871
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,710
that off
state you know which we need to

872
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
state you know which we need to
 

873
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,310
state you know which we need to
trigger the trap door again so

874
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
trigger the trap door again so
 

875
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,950
trigger the trap door again so
we need to be able to control it and rs

876
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
we need to be able to control it and rs
 

877
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,549
we need to be able to control it and rs
latch allows us to do that

878
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
latch allows us to do that
 

879
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,549
latch allows us to do that
hopefully this is the rates

880
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559

 

881
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,750

rate state here so it's off right now

882
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760

 

883
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,990

sorry grass it's still gonna be off yeah

884
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000

 

885
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,710

we'll just put this here for now

886
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720

 

887
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,830

okay so this will go to

888
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840

 

889
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,230

i'm gonna hook that up to

890
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240

 

891
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,470

the redstone torch here

892
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
the redstone torch here
 

893
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,310
the redstone torch here
okay i i decided to block off this

894
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
okay i i decided to block off this
 

895
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,149
okay i i decided to block off this
elevator temporarily

896
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
elevator temporarily
 

897
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,230
elevator temporarily
uh with the new mob ai they're actually

898
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
uh with the new mob ai they're actually
 

899
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,350
uh with the new mob ai they're actually
able to find their way

900
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
able to find their way
 

901
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,630
able to find their way
all the way down it's and uh

902
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
all the way down it's and uh
 

903
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,230
all the way down it's and uh
i heard one walk on the pressure plate

904
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
i heard one walk on the pressure plate
 

905
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,230
i heard one walk on the pressure plate
and it freaked me out

906
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
and it freaked me out
 

907
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,510
and it freaked me out
hopefully he's not in the cave somewhere

908
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
hopefully he's not in the cave somewhere
 

909
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,870
hopefully he's not in the cave somewhere
might have been a creeper i didn't hear

910
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
might have been a creeper i didn't hear
 

911
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,549
might have been a creeper i didn't hear
any noise

912
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
any noise
 

913
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,669
any noise
besides the elevator getting triggered

914
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
besides the elevator getting triggered
 

915
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,549
besides the elevator getting triggered
i got a slime being held at the moment

916
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
i got a slime being held at the moment
 

917
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,230
i got a slime being held at the moment
so we could test this

918
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
so we could test this
 

919
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,310
so we could test this
uh i got the rsnor latch hooked up to

920
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
uh i got the rsnor latch hooked up to
 

921
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,149
uh i got the rsnor latch hooked up to
that torch so i got one two

922
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
that torch so i got one two
 

923
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,710
that torch so i got one two
three redstone torches here

924
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720

 

925
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,909

and that goes up right to the torch

926
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
and that goes up right to the torch
 

927
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,870
and that goes up right to the torch
right there and that connects to the

928
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
right there and that connects to the
 

929
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,830
right there and that connects to the
trapdoor

930
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
trapdoor
 

931
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,789
trapdoor
i got this loaded i think we're all

932
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
i got this loaded i think we're all
 

933
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,549
i got this loaded i think we're all
ready to try it

934
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
ready to try it
 

935
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,230
ready to try it
so as soon as he hits that pressure

936
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
so as soon as he hits that pressure
 

937
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,310
so as soon as he hits that pressure
plate it should send off the cart

938
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
plate it should send off the cart
 

939
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,830
plate it should send off the cart
to pick them up

940
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840

 

941
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,510

that's cool i like that

942
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520

 

943
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,830

you know on second thoughts that our

944
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
you know on second thoughts that our
 

945
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,990
you know on second thoughts that our
snore latch is probably

946
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
snore latch is probably
 

947
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,590
snore latch is probably
unnecessary because this pez dispenser

948
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
unnecessary because this pez dispenser
 

949
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,549
unnecessary because this pez dispenser
and the pickup spot is so close together

950
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
and the pickup spot is so close together
 

951
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:26,870
and the pickup spot is so close together
it's

952
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
it's
 

953
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,710
it's
probably only like a five second delay

954
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
probably only like a five second delay
 

955
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,230
probably only like a five second delay
or so maximum

956
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
or so maximum
 

957
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,070
or so maximum
i don't think it's really required in

958
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
i don't think it's really required in
 

959
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,990
i don't think it's really required in
this case

960
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
this case
 

961
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,310
this case
because we would need a second slime to

962
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
because we would need a second slime to
 

963
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,830
because we would need a second slime to
come within that five seconds

964
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
come within that five seconds
 

965
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,350
come within that five seconds
to cause a problem and i really doubt

966
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
to cause a problem and i really doubt
 

967
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,750
to cause a problem and i really doubt
that would happen

968
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
that would happen
 

969
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,350
that would happen
however i'm gonna leave the rs door

970
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
however i'm gonna leave the rs door
 

971
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,029
however i'm gonna leave the rs door
latch just because it's a little bit

972
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
latch just because it's a little bit
 

973
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,950
latch just because it's a little bit
more professional

974
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
more professional
 

975
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,190
more professional
way of dealing with the situation

976
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200

 

977
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,789

and now we need to hook up a reset for

978
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
and now we need to hook up a reset for
 

979
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,110
and now we need to hook up a reset for
it

980
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
it
 

981
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:07,430
it
so i'll probably use this detector here

982
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440

 

983
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,830

and maybe put a little bit of a delay on

984
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840
and maybe put a little bit of a delay on
 

985
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,549
and maybe put a little bit of a delay on
it

986
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
it
 

987
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,710
it
see wire will be here

988
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
see wire will be here
 

989
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,070
see wire will be here
the detectors right above

990
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080

 

991
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,590

it sounds like we've got another one

992
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
it sounds like we've got another one
 

993
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,510
it sounds like we've got another one
this pez dispenser will hold uh

994
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
this pez dispenser will hold uh
 

995
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,870
this pez dispenser will hold uh
what is it i think six carts which is

996
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
what is it i think six carts which is
 

997
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,590
what is it i think six carts which is
probably

998
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
probably
 

999
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,190
probably
sufficient i don't think we'll get more

1000
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
sufficient i don't think we'll get more
 

1001
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,149
sufficient i don't think we'll get more
slimes than that

1002
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
slimes than that
 

1003
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:50,070
slimes than that
let's see how do i want to do this

1004
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080

 

1005
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,830

i want a little bit of a delay but not

1006
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
i want a little bit of a delay but not
 

1007
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,310
i want a little bit of a delay but not
much

1008
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
much
 

1009
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,350
much
yeah that connects if i do that

1010
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360

 

1011
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,789

i just will go over

1012
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799

 

1013
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,990

a little bit more info about my job so

1014
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
a little bit more info about my job so
 

1015
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,190
a little bit more info about my job so
there's lots of different types of

1016
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
there's lots of different types of
 

1017
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,390
there's lots of different types of
greenhouses i guess

1018
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400

 

1019
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,789

out of stone bricks

1020
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799

 

1021
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,070

in my greenhouse we sell bedding plants

1022
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
in my greenhouse we sell bedding plants

1225
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,389

as far as i know if the chunk unloads

1226

although i'm sure he would have
 

1231
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,630
although i'm sure he would have
despawned before that so it's like he

1232
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
despawned before that so it's like he
 

1233
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,950
despawned before that so it's like he
hit something

1234
