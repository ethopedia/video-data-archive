junctions and have them going all crazy
 

113
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,870

I don't know I changed this around just

114
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:20,880
I don't know I changed this around just
 

115
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,710
I don't know I changed this around just
a slight bit there's a glass running

116
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
a slight bit there's a glass running
 

117
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,500
a slight bit there's a glass running
down the middle now and this prevents

118
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,510
down the middle now and this prevents
 

119
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,150
down the middle now and this prevents
them from hopping across from one side

120
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,160
them from hopping across from one side
 

121
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,479
them from hopping across from one side
to the next and they get through this

122
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,489
to the next and they get through this
 

123
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,460
to the next and they get through this
thing a lot quicker that way most the

124
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,470
thing a lot quicker that way most the
 

125
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,880
thing a lot quicker that way most the
time sometimes they have trouble still

126
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:39,890
time sometimes they have trouble still
 

127
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,920
time sometimes they have trouble still
uh anyway oops

128
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:42,930
uh anyway oops

anyway it's going pretty good okay so I
 

133
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,170
anyway it's going pretty good okay so I
think we are going to try set up killing

134
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,180
think we are going to try set up killing
 

135
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,240

chamber for them in the nether here
 

137
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,009
chamber for them in the nether here
that's the nether hub right over there

138
00:03:59,009 --> 00:03:59,019
that's the nether hub right over there
 

139
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,170
that's the nether hub right over there
and strongholds to the right here so

140
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,180
and strongholds to the right here so
 

141
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,110
and strongholds to the right here so
it's not very far off our path that we

142
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,120
it's not very far off our path that we
 

143
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,970
it's not very far off our path that we
use all the time

144
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:05,980
use all the time
 

145
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,920
use all the time
TNT might be a myth myth a bit a bit

146
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:10,930
TNT might be a myth myth a bit a bit
 

147
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,100

messy now that I think of it because if

148
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,110
messy now that I think of it because if
 

149
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,600
messy now that I think of it because if
you blow it up by a portal the portals

150
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,610
you blow it up by a portal the portals
 

151
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,759
you blow it up by a portal the portals
going to get blown up and you'd have to

152
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:17,769
going to get blown up and you'd have to
 

153
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,909
going to get blown up and you'd have to
teach them city and probably and yeah so

154
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:20,919
teach them city and probably and yeah so
 

155
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,100

maybe we'll just try poison potions and
 

157
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:32,370
maybe we'll just try poison potions and
damage potions yep listen that sound you

158
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,380
damage potions yep listen that sound you
 

159
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,040
damage potions yep listen that sound you
hear that that is crazy you might have

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:15,940

 

665
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:24,670

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,630

those particles let's try with the

670
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:31,640
those particles let's try with the
 

671
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,610
those particles let's try with the
particles off much better the poison of

672
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:36,620
particles off much better the poison of
 

673
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,390
particles off much better the poison of
ocean particles doing it

674
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:39,400
ocean particles doing it
 

675
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,060
ocean particles doing it
alright anyway the reason we are trying

676
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,070
alright anyway the reason we are trying
 

677
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,980
alright anyway the reason we are trying
to fuel up a batch of these is so I can

678
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:44,990
to fuel up a batch of these is so I can
 

679
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,110
to fuel up a batch of these is so I can
get some blocks I'm playing around with

brought over a bunch of different types
 

687
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,570
brought over a bunch of different types
that I thought would be

688
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:56,580
that I thought would be
 

689
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,659
that I thought would be
interesting to try here okay they need

690
00:18:59,659 --> 00:18:59,669
interesting to try here okay they need

00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
another focus block that people
 

757
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,210
another focus block that people
sometimes use is emerald and that also

758
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,220
sometimes use is emerald and that also
 

759

looks pretty good it's very a little

760
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
looks pretty good it's very a little
 

761
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,899
looks pretty good it's very a little
closer in color

00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:04,909

 

763
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:09,000

let's see just regular stone I think

764
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,010
let's see just regular stone I think
 

765
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,140
let's see just regular stone I think
is pretty decent to different types of

766
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,150
is pretty decent to different types of
 

767
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,310
is pretty decent to different types of
stone just that great color is good

768
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
stone just that great color is good
 

769
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,360
stone just that great color is good
although I don't think I would use it I

770
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,370
although I don't think I would use it I
 

771
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,480
although I don't think I would use it I
would prefer diorite over it now and

772
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,490
would prefer diorite over it now and
 

773
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,840
would prefer diorite over it now and
then wanted to try n stone because these

774
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:24,850
then wanted to try n stone because these
 

775
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,820
then wanted to try n stone because these
are like opposite colors or negative

776
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:26,830
are like opposite colors or negative
 

777
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,100
are like opposite colors or negative
colors from each other so yeah I think

778
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,110
colors from each other so yeah I think
 

779
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,720
colors from each other so yeah I think
those look good too the other two I

780
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:33,730
those look good too the other two I
 

781
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,950
those look good too the other two I
don't think I would use it though

782
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
don't think I would use it though
 

783
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,660
don't think I would use it though
because apparently most people hate em

784
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:36,670
because apparently most people hate em
 

785
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,230
because apparently most people hate em
