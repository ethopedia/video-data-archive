203
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,890
the way so don't don't worry about
reporting it yeah this the portal is

204
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:03,900
reporting it yeah this the portal is
 

205
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,800
reporting it yeah this the portal is
taking me 64 blocks instead of eight

206
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:06,810
taking me 64 blocks instead of eight
 

207
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,500
taking me 64 blocks instead of eight
eight blocks per one blocked in the

208
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,510
eight blocks per one blocked in the
 

209
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,110
eight blocks per one blocked in the
nether which is kind of interesting I

210
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,120
nether which is kind of interesting I
 

211
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,659
nether which is kind of interesting I
tried making a new portal just a little

212
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:14,669
tried making a new portal just a little
 

213
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:16,190
tried making a new portal just a little
ways out over here and it looks like

214
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,200
ways out over here and it looks like
 

215
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,780
ways out over here and it looks like
this one's gonna work though so we can

216
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:19,790
this one's gonna work though so we can
 

217
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,120
this one's gonna work though so we can
hopefully find the ice spike biome today

218
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,130
hopefully find the ice spike biome today
 

219
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,020
hopefully find the ice spike biome today
we're in ice mountains over here we had

220
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,030
we're in ice mountains over here we had
 

221
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,590
we're in ice mountains over here we had
to get to like 2800 so we should be

222
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
to get to like 2800 so we should be
 

223
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,340
to get to like 2800 so we should be
fairly close I think this is all new

224
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,350
fairly close I think this is all new
 

225
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,690
fairly close I think this is all new
terrain here I haven't checked it out

226
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:35,700
terrain here I haven't checked it out
 

227
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,570
terrain here I haven't checked it out
yet and I've never seen the spiked ice

228
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580
yet and I've never seen the spiked ice
 

229
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,000
yet and I've never seen the spiked ice
biome in the amplified terrain either so

230
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,010
biome in the amplified terrain either so
 

231
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,030
biome in the amplified terrain either so
I'm curious what its gonna look like if

232
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm curious what its gonna look like if
 

233
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,030
I'm curious what its gonna look like if
if the ice spikes or somehow amplified

234
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,040
if the ice spikes or somehow amplified
 

235
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,210
if the ice spikes or somehow amplified
to or if it's just the terrain we will

236
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,220
to or if it's just the terrain we will
 

237
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,030
to or if it's just the terrain we will
see hopefully we don't have to go too

238
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,040
see hopefully we don't have to go too
 

239
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
see hopefully we don't have to go too
high up it does say mountains though

240
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:54,810
high up it does say mountains though
 

241
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,060
high up it does say mountains though
doesn't it yeah this may take a little

242
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,070
doesn't it yeah this may take a little
 

243
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,580
doesn't it yeah this may take a little
while I'm gonna dig until I see the sky

244
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:01,590
while I'm gonna dig until I see the sky
 

245
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,380
while I'm gonna dig until I see the sky
and then we'll be back well we didn't

246
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,390
and then we'll be back well we didn't
 

247
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,600
and then we'll be back well we didn't
have to go very far just a little bit

248
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:08,610
have to go very far just a little bit
 

249
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,370
have to go very far just a little bit
further here and we have hit the sky

250
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,380
further here and we have hit the sky
 

251
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,180
further here and we have hit the sky
guys woohoo red mushroom in a snow biome

what is going on Oh are we on the verge
 

255
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,250
what is going on Oh are we on the verge
of a border to another biome that's

256
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,260
of a border to another biome that's
 

257
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,200

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,210
weird there's grass here ice Plains so
 

259
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,710
weird there's grass here ice Plains so
we got to go out this way

260
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:31,720
we got to go out this way
 

261
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
we got to go out this way
you have speed potion so we should be

262
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,490
you have speed potion so we should be
 

263
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,920
you have speed potion so we should be
able to get there pretty quick that's

264
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:37,930
able to get there pretty quick that's
 

265
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,270

generating the terrain right now look at

290
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,320
generating the terrain right now look at
 

291
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,920

this overhang we got going this is this

292
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:22,930
this overhang we got going this is this
 

293
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,409
this overhang we got going this is this
pretty crazy and I like tell you you see

this we've got like snow layers all the
 

297
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,530
this we've got like snow layers all the
way up there's there's a layer there

298
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:28,540
way up there's there's a layer there
 

299
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,090
way up there's there's a layer there
there's a layer there another one there

pretty cool let's go explore a little

302
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,630
pretty cool let's go explore a little
 

303
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,060
pretty cool let's go explore a little
bit it's very um it almost looks like

304
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,070
bit it's very um it almost looks like
 

305
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,600
bit it's very um it almost looks like

lake man oh uh that's okay I was

310
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,350
lake man oh uh that's okay I was
 

311
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,719
lake man oh uh that's okay I was
recording I had I think I had our

312
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:54,729
recording I had I think I had our
 

313
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,280
recording I had I think I had our
coordinates save time I was worried

314
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,290
coordinates save time I was worried
 

315
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,920
coordinates save time I was worried
there we might get lost and not find the

316
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:58,930
there we might get lost and not find the
 

317
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,409
there we might get lost and not find the
portal deck but we should be fine and

318
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:04,419
portal deck but we should be fine and
 

319
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,710
portal deck but we should be fine and
that looks crazy

320
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:11,720

 

321
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,450

look at that hill that mountain over

322
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
look at that hill that mountain over
 

323
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,920
look at that hill that mountain over
there that 100 getting lots like that

324

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:32,970
this would be this wouldn't be a bad
 

333
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,930
this would be this wouldn't be a bad
place for a bass really not that we're

334
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:35,940
place for a bass really not that we're
 

335
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,210
place for a bass really not that we're
looking for a place but this is a pretty

336
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,220
looking for a place but this is a pretty
 

337
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:48,080
looking for a place but this is a pretty
nice biome huh I feel like we should go

338
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,090
nice biome huh I feel like we should go
 

339
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,700
nice biome huh I feel like we should go
this way this is where it gets crazier

340
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:49,710
this way this is where it gets crazier
 

341
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,680
this way this is where it gets crazier
there's another big mountain and back

342
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:51,690
there's another big mountain and back
 

343
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,310
there's another big mountain and back
there so while we're here I'm going to

344
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
there so while we're here I'm going to
 

345
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,390
there so while we're here I'm going to
click some of this too I tried in a

346
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,400
click some of this too I tried in a
 

347
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,750
click some of this too I tried in a

efficiency 5 on a pick it did not let me

350
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,480
efficiency 5 on a pick it did not let me
 

351
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,330
efficiency 5 on a pick it did not let me
instant mind it instant mine it so I

352
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,340
instant mind it instant mine it so I
 

353
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,880
instant mind it instant mine it so I
don't think there is a way to hey guy oh

354
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:12,890

 

355
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,330

all they hit each other whoa

356
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:19,340

 

357
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:27,370

all right let's keep going Wow

358
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,380

 

359
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,480

yeah it's pretty cool out here I'll give

360
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,490
yeah it's pretty cool out here I'll give
 

361
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,860
yeah it's pretty cool out here I'll give
this view very nice and there is an

362
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:35,870
this view very nice and there is an
 

363
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,170
this view very nice and there is an
awesome mountain here - it's like an arm

364
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:38,180
awesome mountain here - it's like an arm
 

365
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
awesome mountain here - it's like an arm
coming out of the ground and then the

366
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,190
coming out of the ground and then the
 

367
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,410
coming out of the ground and then the
hand at the top there

368
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,420

 

369
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,030

there's also ocean here it looks like I

370
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,040
there's also ocean here it looks like I
 

371
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,360
there's also ocean here it looks like I
haven't found much for ocean so when

372
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,370
haven't found much for ocean so when
 

373
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,960
haven't found much for ocean so when
that is out or when we do check out the

374
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:52,970
that is out or when we do check out the
 

375
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,150
that is out or when we do check out the
ocean snapshot we may come back over

376
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,160
ocean snapshot we may come back over
 

377
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,500
ocean snapshot we may come back over
here and when I said they get added to

378
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,510
here and when I said they get added to
 

379
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,470
here and when I said they get added to
existing worlds I meant like existing

380
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
existing worlds I meant like existing
 

381
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,400
existing worlds I meant like existing
chunks you visited already so even

382
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,410
chunks you visited already so even
 

383
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,080
chunks you visited already so even
though we've been here the structures

384
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,090
though we've been here the structures
 

385
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,200
though we've been here the structures
should generate when we apply the

386
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,210
should generate when we apply the
 

387
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,630
should generate when we apply the
snapshot with the ocean stuff in which

388
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:13,640
snapshot with the ocean stuff in which
 

389
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:23,550
snapshot with the ocean stuff in which
is a really neat feature

390
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,560

 

391
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,860

okay everyone so we are now over here at

392
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:26,870
okay everyone so we are now over here at
 

393
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,800
okay everyone so we are now over here at
our new base location that was it for

394
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:29,810
our new base location that was it for
 

395
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,420
our new base location that was it for
the spiked ice biome it wasn't very big

396
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,430
the spiked ice biome it wasn't very big
 

397
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,600
the spiked ice biome it wasn't very big
actually there's only one or two really

398
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,610
actually there's only one or two really
 

399
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,490
actually there's only one or two really
cool mountains in it and then that was

400
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:36,500
cool mountains in it and then that was
 

401
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,640
cool mountains in it and then that was
it but I did bring back some packed ice

402
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:39,650
it but I did bring back some packed ice
 

403
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,770
it but I did bring back some packed ice
which we'll probably be using soon in

404
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:41,780
which we'll probably be using soon in
 

405
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,050
which we'll probably be using soon in
the future but now today I have finally

406
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,060
the future but now today I have finally
 

407
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,760
the future but now today I have finally
come up with a plan for this place a

408
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:48,770
come up with a plan for this place a
 

409
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,390
come up with a plan for this place a
building theme possibly maybe we will

410
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:52,400
building theme possibly maybe we will
 

411
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,930
building theme possibly maybe we will
see we'll try it out today though so I

412
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:55,940
see we'll try it out today though so I
 

413
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,550
see we'll try it out today though so I
think we're going to start construction

414
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,560
think we're going to start construction
 

415
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,950
think we're going to start construction
around this area I really like this area

416
00:10:59,950 --> 00:10:59,960
around this area I really like this area
 

417
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,150
around this area I really like this area
here there's a lot of potential for it

418
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
here there's a lot of potential for it
 

419
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
here there's a lot of potential for it
because we got like overhangs and

420
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,130
because we got like overhangs and
 

421
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,770
because we got like overhangs and
there's a lot of height here we can go

422
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:08,780
there's a lot of height here we can go
 

423
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,480
there's a lot of height here we can go
down we can go sideways if we want go

424
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,490
down we can go sideways if we want go
 

425
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,130
down we can go sideways if we want go
through the hill if we want four tunnels

426
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:15,140
through the hill if we want four tunnels
 

427
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,270
through the hill if we want four tunnels
and yeah so and we also have our future

428
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,280
and yeah so and we also have our future
 

429
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,150
and yeah so and we also have our future
storage room right over here too which

430
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
storage room right over here too which
 

431
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,950
storage room right over here too which
will come in handy I would like to get

432
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:23,960
will come in handy I would like to get
 

433
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,330
will come in handy I would like to get
this thing running I know if he's

434
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,340
this thing running I know if he's
 

435
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,950
this thing running I know if he's
noticed but there was some tracks laid

436
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:26,960
noticed but there was some tracks laid
 

437
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,650
noticed but there was some tracks laid
out there but I have a lot more tracks

438
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:29,660
out there but I have a lot more tracks
 

439
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,220
out there but I have a lot more tracks
to run you see one over there um like

440
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,230
to run you see one over there um like
 

441
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,800
to run you see one over there um like
3,000 blocks long at least so our theme

442
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:38,810
3,000 blocks long at least so our theme
 

443
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,410
3,000 blocks long at least so our theme
for our new place is going to be ancient

444
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:41,420
for our new place is going to be ancient
 

445
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,190
for our new place is going to be ancient
ruins I thought about it for a bit and I

446
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
ruins I thought about it for a bit and I
 

447
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,750
ruins I thought about it for a bit and I
think that'll be a good one

448
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,760
think that'll be a good one
 

449
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,980
think that'll be a good one
I kind of want something fairly random

450
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:49,990
I kind of want something fairly random
 

451
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,900
I kind of want something fairly random
ish you know that I can just this build

452
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:52,910
ish you know that I can just this build
 

453
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,310
ish you know that I can just this build
and not have to think about it too much

454
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
and not have to think about it too much
 

455
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,330
and not have to think about it too much
and this hopefully will will give us

456
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,340
and this hopefully will will give us
 

457
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,020
and this hopefully will will give us
that feeling

458
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,030
that feeling
 

459
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,720
that feeling
the thing is though I also want to

460
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:01,730
the thing is though I also want to
 

461
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,530
the thing is though I also want to
include wood colors with it too like the

462
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:05,540
include wood colors with it too like the
 

463
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,740
include wood colors with it too like the
Browns and maybe even a little bit of

464
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:08,750
Browns and maybe even a little bit of
 

465
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,300
Browns and maybe even a little bit of
colored clay and that kind of stuff

466
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,310
colored clay and that kind of stuff
 

467
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,970
colored clay and that kind of stuff
because if it's just gray blocks gray

468
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:12,980
because if it's just gray blocks gray
 

469
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,250
because if it's just gray blocks gray
and green it oh that's what happens and

470
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,260
and green it oh that's what happens and
 

471
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,580
and green it oh that's what happens and
it's terrible ah sneaky little creeper I

did not hear him at all not at all
 

475
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,560
did not hear him at all not at all
so glad I set my spawn here wow there's

476
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,570
so glad I set my spawn here wow there's
 

477
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,480
so glad I set my spawn here wow there's
a problem right there cuz it's six

478
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,490
a problem right there cuz it's six
 

479
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,030
a problem right there cuz it's six

okay guys so we got that flattened out

536
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
okay guys so we got that flattened out
 

537
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,370
okay guys so we got that flattened out
pretty good here next up we're going to

538
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:08,380
pretty good here next up we're going to
 

539
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,160
pretty good here next up we're going to
make a tunnel here that's sort of in

540
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,170
make a tunnel here that's sort of in
 

541
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,100
make a tunnel here that's sort of in
this shape I want it fairly epic you

542
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,110
this shape I want it fairly epic you
 

543
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,710
this shape I want it fairly epic you
know if it's just a 3x3 tunnel it's not

544
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:17,720
know if it's just a 3x3 tunnel it's not
 

545
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,230
know if it's just a 3x3 tunnel it's not
it's not too fancy that's what I brought

546
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
it's not too fancy that's what I brought
 

547
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,030
it's not too fancy that's what I brought
the tnt for I would get out of here so

548
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
the tnt for I would get out of here so
 

549
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,980
the tnt for I would get out of here so
much like the man cave we are going to

550
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:26,990
much like the man cave we are going to
 

551
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,309
much like the man cave we are going to
try build with the shape of the terrain

552
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:29,319
try build with the shape of the terrain
 

553
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,079
try build with the shape of the terrain
but we're not opposed to like making a

554
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,089
but we're not opposed to like making a
 

555
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,240
but we're not opposed to like making a
little modifications to it like this

556
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,250
little modifications to it like this
 

557
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,259
little modifications to it like this
hopefully this isn't the problem

558
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:38,269
hopefully this isn't the problem
 

559
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:42,670
hopefully this isn't the problem
actually maybe we almost need to do it

560
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:42,680
actually maybe we almost need to do it
 

561
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,380
actually maybe we almost need to do it
up higher

562
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,390

 

563
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,150

wait a sec we'll put a few down here

564
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,160
wait a sec we'll put a few down here
 

565
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,890
wait a sec we'll put a few down here
that's like the exact same it will put a

566
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:51,900
that's like the exact same it will put a
 

567
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,560
that's like the exact same it will put a
few up higher do another row over here

568
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:56,570
few up higher do another row over here
 

569
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,410
few up higher do another row over here
umm yeah we're going to be making some

570
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,420
umm yeah we're going to be making some
 

571
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,200
umm yeah we're going to be making some
adjustments to the terrain to our liking

572
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,210

 

573
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,230

and I always enjoy finding excuses to

574
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,240
and I always enjoy finding excuses to
 

575
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,030
and I always enjoy finding excuses to
use TNT even though it's probably just

576
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
use TNT even though it's probably just
 

577
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,900
use TNT even though it's probably just
quicker to use hey speakin hopefully

578
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:14,910
quicker to use hey speakin hopefully
 

579
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,470
quicker to use hey speakin hopefully
this is controlled enough oh wow

580
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:21,480
this is controlled enough oh wow
 

581
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,050
this is controlled enough oh wow
it didn't even activate the lower one

582
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,060
it didn't even activate the lower one
 

583
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,160
it didn't even activate the lower one
really I got so much TNT now guys I love

584
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,170
really I got so much TNT now guys I love
 

585
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:35,110

it yeah I was that was almost overkill

586
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
it yeah I was that was almost overkill
 

587
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,300
it yeah I was that was almost overkill
putting them so close together alright

588
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,310
putting them so close together alright
 

589
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,650
putting them so close together alright
so we're going to have it slightly

590
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
so we're going to have it slightly
 

591
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,810
so we're going to have it slightly
raised here as well that way when you

592
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:41,820
raised here as well that way when you
 

593
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,000
raised here as well that way when you
walk out you kind of look down on the

594
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,010
walk out you kind of look down on the
 

595
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,500
walk out you kind of look down on the
terrain here so actually this height is

596
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,510
terrain here so actually this height is
 

597
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,440
terrain here so actually this height is
pretty good I would say I'm going to

598
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,450
pretty good I would say I'm going to
 

599
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,150
pretty good I would say I'm going to
switch one of those beacons over to

600
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,160
switch one of those beacons over to
 

601
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,730
switch one of those beacons over to
haste to so then I can clear this a lot

602
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:55,740
haste to so then I can clear this a lot
 

603
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,310
haste to so then I can clear this a lot
quicker then over here I kind of want to

604
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,320
quicker then over here I kind of want to
 

605
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,260
quicker then over here I kind of want to
level it out and make a circle around

606
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,270
level it out and make a circle around
 

607
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,500
level it out and make a circle around
this place and maybe we will oops blast

608
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,510
this place and maybe we will oops blast
 

609
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,440
this place and maybe we will oops blast
out this lower middle part into a giant

610
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,450
out this lower middle part into a giant
 

611
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,610
out this lower middle part into a giant
pit I want to see what's down below here

612
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:16,620
pit I want to see what's down below here
 

613
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,690
pit I want to see what's down below here
oh let me get our torches ready I'm

614
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:20,700
oh let me get our torches ready I'm
 

615
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,160
oh let me get our torches ready I'm
gonna jump down and just see what's down

616
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,170
gonna jump down and just see what's down
 

617
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,670
gonna jump down and just see what's down
if we were to blow it all up with TNT oh

618
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:24,680
if we were to blow it all up with TNT oh
 

619
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,090
if we were to blow it all up with TNT oh
yeah yeah I think we should do that

620
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,100
yeah yeah I think we should do that
 

621
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,760
yeah yeah I think we should do that
because this is just like a that it's a

622
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:31,770
because this is just like a that it's a
 

623
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,590
because this is just like a that it's a
dead end otherwise there's nothing

624
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
dead end otherwise there's nothing
 

625
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,420
dead end otherwise there's nothing
really here yeah we'll do that did you

626
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,430
really here yeah we'll do that did you
 

627
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,660
really here yeah we'll do that did you
know my favorite part of construction is

628
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:44,670
know my favorite part of construction is
 

629
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,190
know my favorite part of construction is
actually destruction it's true because

630
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,200
actually destruction it's true because
 

631
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,750
actually destruction it's true because
destruction is awesome

632
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:53,760

 

633
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,130

all right so yeah it's going to go like

634
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,140
all right so yeah it's going to go like
 

635
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,400

I want this overhang filled still though
 

639
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,740
I want this overhang filled still though
and then we will have like support beams

640
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:01,750
and then we will have like support beams
 

641
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,770
and then we will have like support beams
on the very edge holding the ground

642
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:04,780
on the very edge holding the ground
 

643
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,400
on the very edge holding the ground
above us up you can see that cow is

644
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,410
above us up you can see that cow is
 

645
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,610
above us up you can see that cow is
about to have a bad day any last words

646
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:13,620
about to have a bad day any last words
 

647
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,800
about to have a bad day any last words
poor little cow here let's light this

648
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:16,810
poor little cow here let's light this
 

649
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,040
poor little cow here let's light this
one first I might have a bad day too

650
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,050
one first I might have a bad day too
 

651
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,800
one first I might have a bad day too
this guy's dangerous

652
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:21,810
this guy's dangerous
 

653
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,900
this guy's dangerous
all right and we got to take out there -

654
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:24,910
all right and we got to take out there -
 

655
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,689
all right and we got to take out there -
I didn't send a TNT up for that this is

656
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:27,699
I didn't send a TNT up for that this is
 

657
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,250
I didn't send a TNT up for that this is
the big one though there let's what's a

658
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,260
the big one though there let's what's a
 

659
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,800
the big one though there let's what's a
good angle to view this from maybe we

660
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:34,810
good angle to view this from maybe we
 

661
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,170
good angle to view this from maybe we
want to get far away from it's sort of

662
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,180
want to get far away from it's sort of
 

663
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:45,770
want to get far away from it's sort of
but still see it let's go over here

664
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:45,780

 

665
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,460

we're good good all right I guess we

666
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,470
we're good good all right I guess we
 

667
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,540
we're good good all right I guess we
need more how let's see how far down is

668
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:54,550
need more how let's see how far down is
 

669
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,220
need more how let's see how far down is
it or maybe it doesn't even go down here

670
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,230
it or maybe it doesn't even go down here
 

671
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,450
it or maybe it doesn't even go down here
maybe it was just in that forward spot

672
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:02,460
maybe it was just in that forward spot
 

673
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,630
maybe it was just in that forward spot
was it just forward oh I thought I fell

674
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
was it just forward oh I thought I fell
 

675
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,910
was it just forward oh I thought I fell
there might just be if we go forward we

676
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:11,920
there might just be if we go forward we
 

677
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,440
there might just be if we go forward we
might have a lot of blasting to do

678
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,450
might have a lot of blasting to do
 

679
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,900
might have a lot of blasting to do
oh there it is over here okay so all

680
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:18,910
oh there it is over here okay so all
 

681
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,160
oh there it is over here okay so all
this is solid then that's kind of bad

682
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,170
this is solid then that's kind of bad
 

683
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,480
this is solid then that's kind of bad
okay here we go again

684
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,490

 

685
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,840

get me out of here

686
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:32,850

 

687
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,200

all right I want it to like come out

688
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,210
all right I want it to like come out
 

689
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,030
all right I want it to like come out
words kind of like this wall is doing

690
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,040
words kind of like this wall is doing
 

691
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,070
words kind of like this wall is doing
right here where it it comes closer and

692
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,080
right here where it it comes closer and
 

693
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,430
right here where it it comes closer and
then it forms that overhang feel to it I

694
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
then it forms that overhang feel to it I
 

695
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,070
then it forms that overhang feel to it I
want that all around here so this wall

696
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,080
want that all around here so this wall
 

697
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,320
want that all around here so this wall
here is not good because it's perfectly

698
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,330
here is not good because it's perfectly
 

699
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,290
here is not good because it's perfectly
straight so we need to like bring the

700
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:52,300
straight so we need to like bring the
 

701
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,050
straight so we need to like bring the
top towards us a little bit more and

702
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,060
top towards us a little bit more and
 

703
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,480
top towards us a little bit more and
like the bottom out this is a three by

704
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,490
like the bottom out this is a three by
 

705
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:10,140
like the bottom out this is a three by
three by three of TNT how did that do

706
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,150
three by three of TNT how did that do
 

707
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,360
three by three of TNT how did that do
out we broke into it over there yeah so

708
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,370
out we broke into it over there yeah so
 

709
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,730
out we broke into it over there yeah so
this whole pillar like all this has to

710
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:17,740
this whole pillar like all this has to
 

711
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,700
this whole pillar like all this has to
go to get the pit I want a pit that I

712
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:20,710
go to get the pit I want a pit that I
 

713
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,560
go to get the pit I want a pit that I
can like hop down to a lower level here

714
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:22,570
can like hop down to a lower level here
 

715
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,100
can like hop down to a lower level here
really quickly and then we will go out

716
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,110
really quickly and then we will go out
 

717
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,420
really quickly and then we will go out
this way okay

718
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,430
this way okay
 

719
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,970
this way okay
one more run run run run oh we got lunch

720
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:37,980
one more run run run run oh we got lunch
 

721
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,110
one more run run run run oh we got lunch
Wow ah we might need to do that one more

722
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
Wow ah we might need to do that one more
 

723
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,240
Wow ah we might need to do that one more
time yet we're just about to the ground

724
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,250
time yet we're just about to the ground
 

725
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,080
time yet we're just about to the ground
though this should be the last one

726
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,090
though this should be the last one
 

727
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:59,370
though this should be the last one
I hope all I'm not far away

728
00:19:59,370 --> 00:19:59,380

 

729
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,450

yeah that should be good that should be

730
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:01,460
yeah that should be good that should be
 

731
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,250
yeah that should be good that should be
good they're cool

732
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,260
good they're cool
 

733
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,970
good they're cool
and I noticed over here it looks a lot

734
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:06,980
and I noticed over here it looks a lot
 

735
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,000
and I noticed over here it looks a lot
better too if we go like on this pad

736
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,010
better too if we go like on this pad
 

737
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,909
better too if we go like on this pad
here when we look this way now you got

738
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:12,919
here when we look this way now you got
 

739
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,440
here when we look this way now you got
this light over there before it was

740
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,450
this light over there before it was
 

741
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,120
this light over there before it was
completely dark and you couldn't really

742
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,130
completely dark and you couldn't really
 

743
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,850
completely dark and you couldn't really
see anything and it didn't stand out now

744
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:18,860
see anything and it didn't stand out now
 

745
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,580
see anything and it didn't stand out now
it looks pretty cool like that so this

746
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,590
it looks pretty cool like that so this
 

747
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,110
it looks pretty cool like that so this
is starting to come together pretty

748
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,120
is starting to come together pretty
 

749
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,180
is starting to come together pretty
nicely here I did some more terraforming

750
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,190
nicely here I did some more terraforming
 

751
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,930
nicely here I did some more terraforming
off-camera

752
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:28,940
off-camera
 

753
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,049
off-camera
just manually shaping things try get

754
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:32,059
just manually shaping things try get
 

755
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,669
just manually shaping things try get
them flowing a bit nicer so I did this

756
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
them flowing a bit nicer so I did this
 

757
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,279
them flowing a bit nicer so I did this
tunnel room I mean I have another tunnel

758
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:36,289
tunnel room I mean I have another tunnel
 

759
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,860
tunnel room I mean I have another tunnel
going this way and that's going to

760
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,870
going this way and that's going to
 

761
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,380
going this way and that's going to
connect to the opposite side here so

762
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:41,390
connect to the opposite side here so
 

763
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,850
connect to the opposite side here so
instead of going straight through this

764
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:42,860
instead of going straight through this
 

765
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,770
instead of going straight through this
pillar it's going to come around and

766
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:44,780
pillar it's going to come around and
 

767
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,140
pillar it's going to come around and
connect to there a big thing I've been

768
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,150
connect to there a big thing I've been
 

769
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,440
connect to there a big thing I've been
spending my time on is shaping this does

770
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,450
spending my time on is shaping this does
 

771
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,630
spending my time on is shaping this does
the TNT is nice because it can blow up a

772
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:55,640
the TNT is nice because it can blow up a
 

773
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,380
the TNT is nice because it can blow up a
big area quickly and it has a certain

774
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,390
big area quickly and it has a certain
 

775
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,940
big area quickly and it has a certain
randomness to it that you probably would

776
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:00,950
randomness to it that you probably would
 

777
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,690
randomness to it that you probably would
never achieve if you use the pick but

778
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:04,700
never achieve if you use the pick but
 

779
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,840
never achieve if you use the pick but
the downside is it makes a giant mess

780
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:07,850
the downside is it makes a giant mess
 

781
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,299
the downside is it makes a giant mess
and there's it's very rough looking and

782
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:10,309
and there's it's very rough looking and
 

783
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:13,390
and there's it's very rough looking and
yeah so I've basically smoothed out the

784
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:13,400
yeah so I've basically smoothed out the
 

785
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,810
yeah so I've basically smoothed out the
whole thing as best as I could here try

786
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:16,820
whole thing as best as I could here try
 

787
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,659
whole thing as best as I could here try
to add some depth to it and we have like

788
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:19,669
to add some depth to it and we have like
 

789
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,350
to add some depth to it and we have like
the overhang feel to it then I wanted

790
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,360
the overhang feel to it then I wanted
 

791
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,909
the overhang feel to it then I wanted
you can see I've even thought about

792
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:24,919
you can see I've even thought about
 

793
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,919
you can see I've even thought about
adding layers partway up which will put

794
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:29,929
adding layers partway up which will put
 

795
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,500
adding layers partway up which will put
grass here and yeah just just for

796
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,510
grass here and yeah just just for
 

797
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,020
grass here and yeah just just for
