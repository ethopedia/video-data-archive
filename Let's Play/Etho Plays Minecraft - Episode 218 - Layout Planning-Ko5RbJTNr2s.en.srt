can do because I need I need stairs and
 

339
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,040
can do because I need I need stairs and
I need half slabs and there's only I

the game that you can do that with and

344
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,300
the game that you can do that with and
 

345
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,689
the game that you can do that with and
four of those are wooden planks the four

four of those are wooden planks the four
 

347
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,509
four of those are wooden planks the four
colors and then you have bricks which I

348
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:58,519
colors and then you have bricks which I
 

349
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,909
colors and then you have bricks which I
rarely use and then you have I guess

350
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:03,919
rarely use and then you have I guess
 

351
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,989
rarely use and then you have I guess
there's cobble cobble stone brick

352
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:06,999
there's cobble cobble stone brick
 

353

that's it I think eight eight different
 

357
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,849
that's it I think eight eight different
types so I am kind of limited to what I

358
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:18,859
types so I am kind of limited to what I
 

359
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:19,769
types so I am kind of limited to what I
can do

360

can do
 

361
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,229
can do
but we'll try make it look good I think

362
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:23,239
but we'll try make it look good I think
 

363
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,419

pretty much stopped working and I don't

376
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,050
pretty much stopped working and I don't
 

377
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,290
pretty much stopped working and I don't
know why I have a feeling it has to do

skeleton very strange like it was

382
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,360
skeleton very strange like it was
 

383
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,170
skeleton very strange like it was
working okay for a long time then it

384
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,180
working okay for a long time then it
 

385
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,730
working okay for a long time then it
seemed like it just kept slowing down

386
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,740
seemed like it just kept slowing down
 

387
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:19,690
seemed like it just kept slowing down
little by little hmm

388
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:19,700

 

389
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,100

this is bad news if we can't fix it

390
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,110
this is bad news if we can't fix it
 

391
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,540
this is bad news if we can't fix it
let's I'm going to head over to one of

392
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:26,550
let's I'm going to head over to one of
 

393
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,610
let's I'm going to head over to one of
my x-rays I think just checking the

394
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:31,620
my x-rays I think just checking the
 

395
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:38,450
my x-rays I think just checking the
entities around Underground's mm-hmm

396
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,460
entities around Underground's mm-hmm
 

397
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,370
entities around Underground's mm-hmm
everyone head over to one of my x-rays

398
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,380
everyone head over to one of my x-rays
 

399
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,370
everyone head over to one of my x-rays
and see if we can learn anything hmm

400
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,380
and see if we can learn anything hmm
 

401
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,590
and see if we can learn anything hmm
you know I'm trying to figure out why it

402
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
you know I'm trying to figure out why it
 

403
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,910
you know I'm trying to figure out why it
slowed down I don't see any bats really

404
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
slowed down I don't see any bats really
 

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,100
slowed down I don't see any bats really
there's a few slimes jumping around ooh

406
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,110

 

407
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,640

my bad but I don't see the problem

408
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:03,650

 

409
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,040

there's a cave over there I miss to just

410
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,050
there's a cave over there I miss to just
 

411
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,870
there's a cave over there I miss to just
notice that

412
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880

 

413
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,110

huh

415
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,760

okay leaving the area and coming back

416
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:20,770
okay leaving the area and coming back
 

417
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,060
okay leaving the area and coming back
seems to fixed it it's going do it again

418
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,070
seems to fixed it it's going do it again
 

419
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,770
seems to fixed it it's going do it again
I'm guessing there was a slime overload

420
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm guessing there was a slime overload
 

421
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm guessing there was a slime overload
somewhere it could be it could be bat

422

their mob talent with these guys I don't

430
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,250
their mob talent with these guys I don't
 

431
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:49,650
their mob talent with these guys I don't
think but I'm just guessing okay guys so

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,050
laying out the snow here and a circle of
 

441
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,530
laying out the snow here and a circle of
the appropriate size and I'm just using

442
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:10,540
the appropriate size and I'm just using
 

443
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,360
the appropriate size and I'm just using
that as a guide for shaping this we

444
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,370
that as a guide for shaping this we
 

445
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,530
that as a guide for shaping this we
might be changing some stuff here I'm

446
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
might be changing some stuff here I'm
 

447
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,520
might be changing some stuff here I'm
trying to figure out how to do the

448
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,530
trying to figure out how to do the
 

449
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,600
trying to figure out how to do the
staircase now and I owe it was almost

450
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,610
staircase now and I owe it was almost
 

451
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,020
staircase now and I owe it was almost
thinking it would be cool if we did like

452
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,030
thinking it would be cool if we did like
 

453
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,290
thinking it would be cool if we did like
a diagnol staircase that started here

454
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:31,300
a diagnol staircase that started here
 

455

a diagnol staircase that started here
this is the center between that frame

456
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
this is the center between that frame
 

457
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,680
this is the center between that frame
and that frame we had one going up and

458
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:37,690
and that frame we had one going up and
 

459
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,100
and that frame we had one going up and
then sharply turning this way I don't

460
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,110
then sharply turning this way I don't
 

461
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,780
then sharply turning this way I don't
want to see how it'll go if we do

462
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:45,790
want to see how it'll go if we do
 

463
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:53,880
want to see how it'll go if we do
something like that let's see how should

464
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:53,890
something like that let's see how should
 

465
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:02,530
something like that let's see how should
we start this maybe mmm

466
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,540

 

467
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,919

what if we I'm stirring these blocks

468
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:06,929
what if we I'm stirring these blocks
 

469
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,829
what if we I'm stirring these blocks
just random clocks probably just to get

470
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
just random clocks probably just to get
 

471
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:20,000
just random clocks probably just to get
the shape going that's we're not going

472
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,010
the shape going that's we're not going
 

473
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,679
the shape going that's we're not going
to be using cobblestone don't worry

474
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:26,689

 

475
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:36,919

hey get out of the way all right it

476
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:36,929
hey get out of the way all right it
 

477
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:43,820
hey get out of the way all right it
might be a little strange so with ya I

478
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:43,830
might be a little strange so with ya I
 

479
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,320
might be a little strange so with ya I
think what we would want it to do is

480
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,330

that's how this got changed some things
 

657
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,150
that's how this got changed some things
like might be a bit more specific like

00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,160
like might be a bit more specific like
 

659
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,460
like might be a bit more specific like

660
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:58,470
that whole mob egg thing I talked about
 

661

today
um by the way if that was implemented I

664
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
um by the way if that was implemented I
 

665
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,750
um by the way if that was implemented I
think it makes sense to have to weaken

666
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:06,760
think it makes sense to have to weaken
 

667
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,220
think it makes sense to have to weaken

that was the yet added it would probably

674
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:17,710
that was the yet added it would probably
 

675
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,570
that was the yet added it would probably
be because somebody watched my episode

676
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:21,580
be because somebody watched my episode
 

677
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,460
be because somebody watched my episode
and where a lot of people watch my

678
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,470
and where a lot of people watch my
 

679
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,639
and where a lot of people watch my
episode and tried to convey that idea to

680
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:26,649
episode and tried to convey that idea to
 

681
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,659
episode and tried to convey that idea to
to Dinnerbone or somebody else at Mojang

to Dinnerbone or somebody else at Mojang
and again that would not be directly

684
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:32,679
and again that would not be directly
 

685
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,769
and again that would not be directly
because of me it would be indirectly and

686
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:36,779
because of me it would be indirectly and
 

687
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,940
because of me it would be indirectly and
yeah so that's the answer to that anyway

688
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:41,950
yeah so that's the answer to that anyway
 

689
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,190
