your your
 

145

your your
game mode difficulty so 33 at most

146
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
game mode difficulty so 33 at most
 

147
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,110
game mode difficulty so 33 at most
and i bet you i don't know for sure but

148
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
and i bet you i don't know for sure but
 

149
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,350
and i bet you i don't know for sure but
i bet if you push the creeper into

150
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
i bet if you push the creeper into
 

151
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,190
i bet if you push the creeper into
the horse before you triggered the trap

152
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
the horse before you triggered the trap
 

153
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,110
the horse before you triggered the trap
it would get you a charged reaper

506
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
where we
 

507
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,550
where we
automatically harvest each individual

508
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
automatically harvest each individual
 

509
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,150
automatically harvest each individual
pumpkin as soon as it grows

510
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
pumpkin as soon as it grows
 

511
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,030
pumpkin as soon as it grows
is the hope kind of we're kind of doing

512
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
is the hope kind of we're kind of doing
 

513
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,630
is the hope kind of we're kind of doing
that it does have a flaw though

514
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
that it does have a flaw though
 

515
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,750
that it does have a flaw though
which we'll get to in a second uh no

516
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
which we'll get to in a second uh no
 

517
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,389
which we'll get to in a second uh no
usually the way these farms work you can

518
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
usually the way these farms work you can
 

519
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,990
usually the way these farms work you can
use redstone

520
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
use redstone
 

521
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,269
use redstone
as one method so like let's say

522
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
as one method so like let's say
 

523
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,310
as one method so like let's say
we have a piston uh

524
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
we have a piston uh
 

525
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,269
we have a piston uh
over here to harvest it or something

526
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
over here to harvest it or something
 

527
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,190
over here to harvest it or something
like that

528
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
like that
 

529
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,389
like that
and if a pumpkin's there

530
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
and if a pumpkin's there
 

531
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,550
and if a pumpkin's there
it sends a signal to the piston and then

532
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
it sends a signal to the piston and then
 

533
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,470
it sends a signal to the piston and then
automatically breaks it so if

534
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
automatically breaks it so if
 

535
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,310
automatically breaks it so if
ever a pumpkin grows here it'll

536
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
ever a pumpkin grows here it'll
 

537
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,230
ever a pumpkin grows here it'll
automatically harvest it

538
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
automatically harvest it
 

539
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,829
automatically harvest it
so that's one way you can use redstone

540
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
so that's one way you can use redstone
 

541
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,150
so that's one way you can use redstone
some of them they use bud switches

542
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
some of them they use bud switches
 

543
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,069
some of them they use bud switches
some of them they just run on a clock so

544
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
some of them they just run on a clock so
 

545
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,230
some of them they just run on a clock so
it constantly tries to harvest it

546
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
it constantly tries to harvest it
 

547
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,710
it constantly tries to harvest it
whether or not it's there uh the way

548
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
whether or not it's there uh the way
 

549
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,389
whether or not it's there uh the way
we're doing ours though

550
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
we're doing ours though
 

551
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,150
we're doing ours though
is a little bit strange basically

552
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
is a little bit strange basically
 

553
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,190
is a little bit strange basically
something like this uh we have the

554
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
something like this uh we have the
 

555
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,990
something like this uh we have the
piston

556
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
piston
 

557
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,069
piston
over here and

558
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079

 

559
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,269

we're gonna have to go to the nether

560
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
we're gonna have to go to the nether
 

561
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,750
we're gonna have to go to the nether
though because i'm not another quartz

562
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
though because i'm not another quartz
 

563
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,389
though because i'm not another quartz
i just found out uh yeah we're using

564
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
i just found out uh yeah we're using
 

565
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,990
i just found out uh yeah we're using
daylight sensors i

566
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
daylight sensors i
 

567
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,350
daylight sensors i
thought this would be a fun way of doing

568
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
thought this would be a fun way of doing
 

569
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,190
thought this would be a fun way of doing
it so basically

570
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
it so basically
 

571
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,430
it so basically
sends a signal to that redstone down

572
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
sends a signal to that redstone down
 

573
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,710
sends a signal to that redstone down
there

574
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
there
 

575
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,910
there
then we'll go up redstone torch that's

576
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
then we'll go up redstone torch that's
 

577
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,750
then we'll go up redstone torch that's
all we have to do

578
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
all we have to do
 

579
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,750
all we have to do
then we just got to cover this up we can

580
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
then we just got to cover this up we can
 

581
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,590
then we just got to cover this up we can
like throw in a light here if we want

582
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
like throw in a light here if we want
 

583
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,629
like throw in a light here if we want
that to blink every time it harvests

584
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
that to blink every time it harvests
 

585
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,150
that to blink every time it harvests
and then like cover this up like so

586
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
and then like cover this up like so
 

587
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,550
and then like cover this up like so
so now if a pumpkin was to grow here

588
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
so now if a pumpkin was to grow here
 

589
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,470
so now if a pumpkin was to grow here
like if we had a plant here and a plant

590
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
like if we had a plant here and a plant
 

591
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,949
like if we had a plant here and a plant
here and a pumpkin grew here

592
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
here and a pumpkin grew here
 

593
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,190
here and a pumpkin grew here
then it will block off the light pistons

594
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
then it will block off the light pistons
 

595
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,750
then it will block off the light pistons
allow light to pass through

596
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760

 

597
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,590

there we go that looked a little strange

598
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
there we go that looked a little strange
 

599
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,790
there we go that looked a little strange
for some reason but

600
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
for some reason but
 

601
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,710
for some reason but
uh this version of minecraft

602
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
uh this version of minecraft
 

603
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,829
uh this version of minecraft
redstone doesn't work the best i've been

604
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
redstone doesn't work the best i've been
 

605
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,389
redstone doesn't work the best i've been
finding

606
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
finding
 

607
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,670
finding
but yeah it's doing the trick

608
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
but yeah it's doing the trick
 

609
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,150
but yeah it's doing the trick
uh-huh so every time the light gets

610
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
uh-huh so every time the light gets
 

611
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,990
uh-huh so every time the light gets
blocked to that daylight sensor it

612
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
blocked to that daylight sensor it
 

613
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,389
blocked to that daylight sensor it
it breaks it the downside with this

614
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
it breaks it the downside with this
 

615
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,030
it breaks it the downside with this
method

616
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
method
 

617
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,470
method
is at night time this piston just

618
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
is at night time this piston just
 

619
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,829
is at night time this piston just
extends

620
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
extends
 

621
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,829
extends
and stays extended so no pumpkin can

622
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
and stays extended so no pumpkin can
 

623
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,949
and stays extended so no pumpkin can
grow

624
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
grow
 

625
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,430
grow
uh one way we might go around fixing

626
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
uh one way we might go around fixing
 

627
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,350
uh one way we might go around fixing
that

628
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
that
 

629
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,310
that
is to add a control underneath here to

630
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
is to add a control underneath here to
 

631
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,590
is to add a control underneath here to
override it

632
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
override it
 

633
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,350
override it
so that will make sure this is always

634
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
so that will make sure this is always
 

635
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,350
so that will make sure this is always
always locked even

636
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
always locked even
 

637
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,870
always locked even
like otherwise

638
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880

 

639
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,389

like at nighttime this is how the piston

640
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
like at nighttime this is how the piston
 

641
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,829
like at nighttime this is how the piston
is going to be right but if we have a

642
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
is going to be right but if we have a
 

643
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,670
is going to be right but if we have a
torch under here we can control whether

644
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
torch under here we can control whether
 

645
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,030
torch under here we can control whether
it's extended or not

646
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
it's extended or not
 

647
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,470
it's extended or not
and then we could operate it on a clock

648
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
and then we could operate it on a clock
 

649
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,550
and then we could operate it on a clock
even if we wanted

650
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
even if we wanted
 

651
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,150
even if we wanted
but we're just doing this as like a fun

652
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
but we're just doing this as like a fun
 

653
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,590
but we're just doing this as like a fun
project too so i want to use the

654
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
project too so i want to use the
 

655
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,150
project too so i want to use the
daylight sensors

656
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
daylight sensors
 

657
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,870
daylight sensors
okay so i am nether quartz hunting now i

658
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
okay so i am nether quartz hunting now i
 

659
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,870
okay so i am nether quartz hunting now i
had to go out a little bit further in

660
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
had to go out a little bit further in
 

661
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,389
had to go out a little bit further in
the nether here

662
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
the nether here
 

663
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,470
the nether here
and i think this is a new fortress so

664
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
and i think this is a new fortress so
 

665
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,389
and i think this is a new fortress so
let's check out these chess

666
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399

 

667
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,750

okay oh gold armor good

668
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
okay oh gold armor good
 

669
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,069
okay oh gold armor good
i'll take that that's a really good one

670
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
i'll take that that's a really good one
 

671
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,110
i'll take that that's a really good one
we'll give that to

672
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
we'll give that to
 

673
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,430
we'll give that to

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,590
we got all the stuff we need together
here guys we can start building our

842
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
here guys we can start building our
 

843
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,949
here guys we can start building our
giant pumpkin patch uh we're gonna do it

844
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
giant pumpkin patch uh we're gonna do it
 

845
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,870
giant pumpkin patch uh we're gonna do it
uh pretty close to the nexus actually

846
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
uh pretty close to the nexus actually
 

847
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,110
uh pretty close to the nexus actually
there's a a swamp area here

848
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
there's a a swamp area here
 

849
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,390
there's a a swamp area here
this is like on the back of the nexus

850
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
this is like on the back of the nexus
 

851
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,390
this is like on the back of the nexus
it's just right over there and on the

852
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
it's just right over there and on the
 

853
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,549
it's just right over there and on the
right side of it we got the swamp area

854
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
right side of it we got the swamp area
 

855
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,750
right side of it we got the swamp area
it's super flat

856
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
it's super flat
 

857
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,950
it's super flat
super big so we can go

858
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
super big so we can go
 

859
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,110
super big so we can go
as big as we want with this project and

860
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
as big as we want with this project and
 

861
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,909
as big as we want with this project and
let's see i'm going to build it on this

862
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
let's see i'm going to build it on this
 

863
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,390
let's see i'm going to build it on this
level

864
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
level
 

865
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,390
level
here so any dirt above this i'm just

866
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
here so any dirt above this i'm just
 

867
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,190
here so any dirt above this i'm just
going to level

868
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
going to level
 

869
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,830
going to level
level it out and like

870
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840
level it out and like
 

871
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,789
level it out and like
so and this should be a fairly easy

872
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
so and this should be a fairly easy
 

873
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,070
so and this should be a fairly easy
thing to build

874
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
thing to build
 

875
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,350
thing to build
it's a simple pattern

876
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360

 

877
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,710

let's see that maybe we'll start

878
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
let's see that maybe we'll start
 

879
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,230
let's see that maybe we'll start
around i don't know

880
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
around i don't know
 

881
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,710
around i don't know
we'll start over here so basically

882
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
we'll start over here so basically
 

883
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,470
we'll start over here so basically
pumpkins are going to grow on this dirt

884
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
pumpkins are going to grow on this dirt
 

885
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,190
pumpkins are going to grow on this dirt
right

886
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
right
 

887
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,909
right
you get two lines of it one on each side

888
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
you get two lines of it one on each side
 

889
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,430
you get two lines of it one on each side
the water stream is going to go in the

890
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
the water stream is going to go in the
 

891
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,549
the water stream is going to go in the
middle to carry the

892
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
middle to carry the
 

893
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,510
middle to carry the
the pumpkins to us uh to the hoppers or

894
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
the pumpkins to us uh to the hoppers or
 

895
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,470
the pumpkins to us uh to the hoppers or
whatever we set up

896
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
whatever we set up
 

897
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,390
whatever we set up
at the end of it all right

898
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
at the end of it all right
 

899
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,470
at the end of it all right
um the pistons they're gonna go

900
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
um the pistons they're gonna go
 

901
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,590
um the pistons they're gonna go
like over here here here

902
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
like over here here here
 

903
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,390
like over here here here
space them two apart from each other

904
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400

 

905
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,750

all right all the way down uh

906
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
all right all the way down uh
 

907
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,230
all right all the way down uh
yeah so i think pumpkins are the way to

908
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
yeah so i think pumpkins are the way to
 

909
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,590
yeah so i think pumpkins are the way to
go

910
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
go
 

911
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,590
go
oh i have them on my hot bar it's like

912
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
oh i have them on my hot bar it's like
 

913
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,430
oh i have them on my hot bar it's like
man where'd they go

914
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
man where'd they go
 

915
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,669
man where'd they go
uh as far as villager trading goes uh

916
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
uh as far as villager trading goes uh
 

917
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,510
uh as far as villager trading goes uh
like if you trade something like paper

918
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
like if you trade something like paper
 

919
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,350
like if you trade something like paper
for example

920
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
for example
 

921
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,270
for example
it has that extra step to it where you

922
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
it has that extra step to it where you
 

923
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,190
it has that extra step to it where you
have to convert the sugarcane

924
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
have to convert the sugarcane
 

925
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,470
have to convert the sugarcane
to paper which you know might not sound

926
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
to paper which you know might not sound
 

927
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,070
to paper which you know might not sound
like a big deal but when you go on

928
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
like a big deal but when you go on
 

929
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,430
like a big deal but when you go on
large scale it gets really annoying

930
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
large scale it gets really annoying
 

931
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,150
large scale it gets really annoying
um something like zombie flash also not

932
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
um something like zombie flash also not
 

933
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,190
um something like zombie flash also not
the greatest thing

934
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
the greatest thing
 

935
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,230
the greatest thing
because you can only like trade

936
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
because you can only like trade
 

937
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,150
because you can only like trade
like every emerald you get from the

938
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
like every emerald you get from the
 

939
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,510
like every emerald you get from the
villager you have to

940
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
villager you have to
 

941
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,909
villager you have to
replace the stack of zombie flesh in the

942
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
replace the stack of zombie flesh in the
 

943
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,430
replace the stack of zombie flesh in the
trade window

944
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
trade window
 

945
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,630
trade window
um which takes a lot of time the big

946
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
um which takes a lot of time the big
 

947
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,029
um which takes a lot of time the big
thing

948
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
thing
 

949
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,270
thing
that takes time is like moving the items

950
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
that takes time is like moving the items
 

951
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,350
that takes time is like moving the items
around crafting them to whatever you

952
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
around crafting them to whatever you
 

953
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,029
around crafting them to whatever you
need

need
oops and then

956
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799

 

957
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,710

waiting for the trade to refresh with

pretty good amount
 

973
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,750
pretty good amount
um yeah anyways i'm gonna do a bunch of

974
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
um yeah anyways i'm gonna do a bunch of
 

975
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,870
um yeah anyways i'm gonna do a bunch of
building here

976
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
building here
 

977
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:38,789
building here
and then we will maybe check it out

978
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799

 

979
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,310

okay well the redstone's all done

980
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
okay well the redstone's all done
 

981
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,070
okay well the redstone's all done
uh i think this is what i want to try

982
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
uh i think this is what i want to try
 

983
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,549
uh i think this is what i want to try
for the looks we'll do like uh

984
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
for the looks we'll do like uh
 

985
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,789
for the looks we'll do like uh
dark oak like so

986
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
dark oak like so
 

987
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,669
dark oak like so
pretty simple pattern uh i do want to do

988
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
pretty simple pattern uh i do want to do
 

989
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,110
pretty simple pattern uh i do want to do
the lamp i think it'll look cool

990
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
the lamp i think it'll look cool
 

991
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,270
the lamp i think it'll look cool
i might regret it later if it causes lag

992
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
i might regret it later if it causes lag
 

993
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,029
i might regret it later if it causes lag
but we'll try it out

994
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
but we'll try it out
 

995
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,750
but we'll try it out
and then we'll do oak slabs over top and

996
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
and then we'll do oak slabs over top and
 

997
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,230
and then we'll do oak slabs over top and
that's

998
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
that's
 

999
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,230
that's
pretty much all we got to do with this

1000
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
pretty much all we got to do with this
 

1001
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,590
pretty much all we got to do with this
this thing here oh yeah and we got to

1002
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
i like the oak because it kind of
 

1009
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,149
i like the oak because it kind of
matches the piston head

1010
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
matches the piston head
 

1011
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,789
matches the piston head
well we are getting very close to uh

1012
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
well we are getting very close to uh
 

1013
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,230
well we are getting very close to uh
working farm here

1014
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
working farm here
 

1015
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,310
working farm here
i just did like 70 plants worth right

1016
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
i just did like 70 plants worth right
 

1017
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,350
i just did like 70 plants worth right
now we will

1018
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
now we will
 

1019
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,070
now we will
we will expand this though ah that's all

1020
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
we will expand this though ah that's all
 

1021
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,590
we will expand this though ah that's all
the materials i had

1022
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
the materials i had
 

1023
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,710
the materials i had
though need more redstone need more dark

1024
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
though need more redstone need more dark
 

1025

uh but yeah we'll try this out so
 

1033
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,909
uh but yeah we'll try this out so
let's get our pumpkins planted

1034
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
let's get our pumpkins planted
 

1035
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,230
let's get our pumpkins planted
and yeah the water that moves the

1036
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
and yeah the water that moves the
 

1037
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,029
and yeah the water that moves the
pumpkins

1038
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
pumpkins
 

1039
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,070
pumpkins
like the ones we harvest is also what

1040
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
like the ones we harvest is also what
 

1041
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,909
like the ones we harvest is also what
hydrates the pumpkins here which is kind

1042
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
hydrates the pumpkins here which is kind
 

1043
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,110
hydrates the pumpkins here which is kind
of cool

1044
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
of cool
 

1045
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,390
of cool
uh this is not a perfect 100

1046
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
uh this is not a perfect 100
 

1047
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,149
uh this is not a perfect 100
lossless farm though i haven't even

1048
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
lossless farm though i haven't even
 

1049
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,390
lossless farm though i haven't even
bothered like there's a good chance

1050
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
bothered like there's a good chance
 

1051
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,870
bothered like there's a good chance
pumpkins will land in this dead space

1052
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
pumpkins will land in this dead space
 

1053
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,710
pumpkins will land in this dead space
here it's fine i'm not too worried about

1054
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
here it's fine i'm not too worried about
 

1055
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,669
here it's fine i'm not too worried about
it

1056
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
it
 

1057
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,630
it
um in my testing just about all of them

1058
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
um in my testing just about all of them
 

1059
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,470
um in my testing just about all of them
like always went into this middle stream

1060
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
like always went into this middle stream
 

1061
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,590
like always went into this middle stream
though

1062
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
though
 

1063
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,630
though
uh i had better success if i put like a

1064
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
uh i had better success if i put like a
 

1065
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,029
uh i had better success if i put like a
block

1066
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
block
 

1067
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,909
block
above where the piston pushes sometimes

1068
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
above where the piston pushes sometimes
 

1069
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,230
above where the piston pushes sometimes
the

1070
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
the
 

1071
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,909
the
the pumpkin will land on top of the

1072
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
the pumpkin will land on top of the
 

1073
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,350
the pumpkin will land on top of the
piston head

1074
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
piston head
 

1075
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,110
piston head
but if you if you have something here it

1076
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
but if you if you have something here it
 

1077
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,870
but if you if you have something here it
stops it but it doesn't look as good so

1078
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
stops it but it doesn't look as good so
 

1079
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,350
stops it but it doesn't look as good so
i don't know if we'll do it

1080
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
i don't know if we'll do it
 

1081
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,990
i don't know if we'll do it
all right run down here

1082
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
all right run down here
 

1083
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,950
all right run down here
and as soon as we grow these we are

1084
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
and as soon as we grow these we are
 

1085
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,549
and as soon as we grow these we are
going to start getting pumpkins maybe we

1086
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
going to start getting pumpkins maybe we
 

1087
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,110
going to start getting pumpkins maybe we
will do that already then

1088
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
will do that already then
 

1089
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,310
will do that already then
aha the farm is active

1090
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
aha the farm is active
 

1091
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,789
aha the farm is active
uh i hope i did not actually test them

1092
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
uh i hope i did not actually test them
 

1093
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,750
uh i hope i did not actually test them
growing

1094
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
growing
 

1095
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,710
growing
but i'm assuming it's gonna trigger the

1096
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
but i'm assuming it's gonna trigger the
 

1097
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,909
but i'm assuming it's gonna trigger the
daylight sensors right

1098
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
daylight sensors right
 

1099
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,669
daylight sensors right
there's no need for a block update or

1100
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
there's no need for a block update or
 

1101
00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:00,789
there's no need for a block update or
anything i hope

1102
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799

 

1103
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,950

well here we go everybody this is about

1104
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
well here we go everybody this is about
 

1105
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,029
well here we go everybody this is about
70 plants or so not exactly

1106
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
70 plants or so not exactly
 

1107
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,310
70 plants or so not exactly
there there was one pumpkin

1108
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
there there was one pumpkin
 

1109
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,669
there there was one pumpkin
it's pretty easy to spot them when they

1110
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
it's pretty easy to spot them when they
 

1111
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,590
it's pretty easy to spot them when they
grow actually

1112
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
grow actually
 

1113
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,909
grow actually
there's another one this will give us a

1114
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
there's another one this will give us a
 

1115
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,190
there's another one this will give us a
good idea of like habit

1116
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
good idea of like habit
 

1117
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,029
good idea of like habit
how big we want to make this farm too

1118
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
how big we want to make this farm too
 

1119
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,430
how big we want to make this farm too
like at the rate we're getting them here

1120
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
like at the rate we're getting them here
 

1121
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,870
like at the rate we're getting them here
seems to be about one every five to ten

1122
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
seems to be about one every five to ten
 

1123
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,870
seems to be about one every five to ten
seconds maybe

1124
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880

 

1125
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,390

sometimes there's longer gaps though but

1126
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
sometimes there's longer gaps though but
 

1127
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,990
sometimes there's longer gaps though but
then sometimes you get two or three at

1128
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
then sometimes you get two or three at
 

1129
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,990
then sometimes you get two or three at
once

1130
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
once
 

1131
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,110
once
it's a really long gap

1132
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
it's a really long gap
 

1133
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,350
it's a really long gap
come on where are my pumpkins

1134
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360

 

1135
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,470

uh wow okay

1136
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
uh wow okay
 

1137
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,269
uh wow okay
um any day now

1138
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
um any day now
 

1139
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,230
um any day now
why aren't they growing guys what

1140
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
why aren't they growing guys what
 

1141
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,630
why aren't they growing guys what
happened in minecraft

1142
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
happened in minecraft
 

1143
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,310
happened in minecraft
did time freeze

1144
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320

 

1145
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,350

oh there we go finally that was a really

1146
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
oh there we go finally that was a really
 

1147
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,390
oh there we go finally that was a really
long

1148
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
long
 

1149
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,710
long
really long time

1150
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720

 

1151
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,110

and again we're having a long gap here

1152
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
and again we're having a long gap here
 

1153
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,990
and again we're having a long gap here
okay

1154
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
okay
 

1155
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,870
okay
maybe not as fast as i thought oh there

1156
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
maybe not as fast as i thought oh there
 

1157
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,470
maybe not as fast as i thought oh there
goes one

1158
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
goes one
 

1159
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,110
goes one
but anyways uh because we have them

1160
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
but anyways uh because we have them
 

1161
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,750
but anyways uh because we have them
growing

1162
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
growing
 

1163
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,669
growing
on both sides here it's actually a

1164
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
on both sides here it's actually a
 

1165
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,430
on both sides here it's actually a
pretty efficient farm like

1166
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
pretty efficient farm like
 

1167
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,269
pretty efficient farm like
each plant can grow either to the left

1168
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
each plant can grow either to the left
 

1169
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,590
each plant can grow either to the left
or the right if you only have like one

1170
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
or the right if you only have like one
 

1171
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,190
or the right if you only have like one
spot it can grow to it's all

1172
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
spot it can grow to it's all
 

1173
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,149
spot it can grow to it's all
like half the speed right so this is

1174
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
