that's the multi-threading thing
see if that makes a difference um

144
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
see if that makes a difference um
 

145
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,790
see if that makes a difference um

where i can find a mushroom biome
 

535
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,430

and as you know those always spawn in

536
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
and as you know those always spawn in
 

537
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,550
and as you know those always spawn in
the middle of the ocean

538
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
the middle of the ocean
 

539
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,269

all right let's go check it out this
 

701
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,710
all right let's go check it out this
might be amplified

702
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
might be amplified
 

703
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,870
might be amplified
mushroom biome if that's a thing

704
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
mushroom biome if that's a thing
 

705
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,509
mushroom biome if that's a thing
if it is the right place also oh not

mushroom island i
 

715
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,310
mushroom island i
staircased out of the cave and here we

716
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
staircased out of the cave and here we
 

717
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,110
staircased out of the cave and here we
are

718
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
are
 

719
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,509
are
it is amplified too you see that there's

720
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
it is amplified too you see that there's
 

721
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,030
it is amplified too you see that there's
it's a pretty big mountain there

722

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
this is a different biome
 

743
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,470
this is a different biome
right yeah ocean then you cross the line

744
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
right yeah ocean then you cross the line
 

745
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,550
right yeah ocean then you cross the line
and it becomes mushroom island okay so

746
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
and it becomes mushroom island okay so
 

747
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,030
and it becomes mushroom island okay so
the

748
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
the
 

749
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,350
the
the mushroom island grass is even

750
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
the mushroom island grass is even
 

751
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,710
the mushroom island grass is even
greener

752
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
greener
 

753
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,389
greener
it's like starting to transition to the

754
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
it's like starting to transition to the
 

755
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,150
it's like starting to transition to the
ocean grass

756
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
ocean grass
 

757
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,189
ocean grass
already um

758
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
already um
 

759
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,749
already um
so keep your eyes open we will possibly

so keep your eyes open we will possibly
 

761
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,389
so keep your eyes open we will possibly
spot one

spot one
 

763
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,150
spot one
anytime here here's a good chance right

764
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
anytime here here's a good chance right
 

765
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,829
anytime here here's a good chance right
now a lot more ocean that we haven't

766
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
now a lot more ocean that we haven't
 

767
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,389
now a lot more ocean that we haven't
seen

768
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399

 

769
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,790

i did bring my good helmet too we'll get

770
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
i did bring my good helmet too we'll get
 

771
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,389
i did bring my good helmet too we'll get
a little bit more armor with this

772
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
a little bit more armor with this
 

773
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,230
a little bit more armor with this
and we will be able to see underwater

774
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
and we will be able to see underwater
 

775
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,470
and we will be able to see underwater
pretty pretty easily too

776
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480

 

777
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,710

nope all right i'm going to keep going
 

779
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,310
nope all right i'm going to keep going
around the island hopefully we'll find

780
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
around the island hopefully we'll find
 

781
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,710
around the island hopefully we'll find
one

782
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
one
 

783
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,550
one
and if not we will just take a boat and

784
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
and if not we will just take a boat and
 

785
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,829
and if not we will just take a boat and
we'll sail around for a bit

786
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
we'll sail around for a bit
 

787
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,990
we'll sail around for a bit
and most likely we'll find one

788
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000

 

789
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,029

yep there is one here on the very tip of

790
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
yep there is one here on the very tip of
 

791
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,789
yep there is one here on the very tip of
the mushroom island i saw it and just

792
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
the mushroom island i saw it and just
 

793
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,669
the mushroom island i saw it and just
barely

794
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
barely
 

795
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,189
