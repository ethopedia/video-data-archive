00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,020
welcome back to another episode we are
 

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,900
welcome back to another episode we are
we're going to head on over to the

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:17,910
we're going to head on over to the
 

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,929
we're going to head on over to the
nether to start off with today I have

8
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:20,939
nether to start off with today I have
 

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,320
nether to start off with today I have
been working on the track system there's

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,330
been working on the track system there's
 

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,509
been working on the track system there's
a zombie pigman in there this is a

12
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:26,519
a zombie pigman in there this is a
 

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,660
a zombie pigman in there this is a
little risky we still haven't solved

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:29,670
little risky we still haven't solved
 

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,790
little risky we still haven't solved
this problem if I enter pearl into him

16
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:33,800
this problem if I enter pearl into him
 

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,389
this problem if I enter pearl into him
we're in trouble here

18
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:37,399

 

19
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,310

whew now we solved it holy smokes like I

20
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
whew now we solved it holy smokes like I
 

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,150
whew now we solved it holy smokes like I
hit me for six hearts that was dangerous

22
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
hit me for six hearts that was dangerous
 

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,100
hit me for six hearts that was dangerous
so yeah we're going to go to the nether

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,110
so yeah we're going to go to the nether
 

25
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,560
so yeah we're going to go to the nether
and we're going to work on the rail line

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:51,570
and we're going to work on the rail line
 

27
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,229
and we're going to work on the rail line
well I'll show you where where we're at

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
well I'll show you where where we're at
 

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,970
well I'll show you where where we're at
with it at this point in time I have

30
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:55,980
with it at this point in time I have
 

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,470
with it at this point in time I have
been working on it here and there and

32
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,480
been working on it here and there and
 

33
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,849
been working on it here and there and
right now I'm like trying to figure out

34
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:01,859
right now I'm like trying to figure out
 

35
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,680
right now I'm like trying to figure out
how I'm going to do the inside of its

36
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:03,690
how I'm going to do the inside of its
 

37
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,620
how I'm going to do the inside of its
like let's try this out I tried a a wild

38
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,630
like let's try this out I tried a a wild
 

39
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,840
like let's try this out I tried a a wild
style here with a bunch of plants and

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:11,850
style here with a bunch of plants and
 

41
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,390
style here with a bunch of plants and
craziness and then there's also just a

42
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
craziness and then there's also just a
 

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,830
craziness and then there's also just a
straight-up lever thing here the way I

44
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
straight-up lever thing here the way I
 

45
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,530
straight-up lever thing here the way I
originally was going to do it I don't

46
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,540
originally was going to do it I don't
 

47
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,410
originally was going to do it I don't
think is going to really work originally

48
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:24,420
think is going to really work originally
 

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,300
think is going to really work originally
I was just going to have a bunch of the

50
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,310
I was just going to have a bunch of the
 

51
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,539
I was just going to have a bunch of the
bunch of half slabs like this but the

52
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:29,549
bunch of half slabs like this but the
 

53
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,580
bunch of half slabs like this but the
thing is we got to power these these

54
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:31,590
thing is we got to power these these
 

55
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,249
thing is we got to power these these
tracks somehow and I could do detector

56
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,259
tracks somehow and I could do detector
 

57
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,100
tracks somehow and I could do detector
rails but then when we get to like a I

58
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,110
rails but then when we get to like a I
 

59
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,249
rails but then when we get to like a I
switch like this we can't have detector

60
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:40,259
switch like this we can't have detector
 

61
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,770
switch like this we can't have detector
rails here really the mess up the

62
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
rails here really the mess up the
 

63
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,950
rails here really the mess up the
junction so ideally I would like you to

64
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
junction so ideally I would like you to
 

65
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,620
junction so ideally I would like you to
work with just regular tracks and power

66
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:48,630
work with just regular tracks and power
 

67
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,899
work with just regular tracks and power
it some some way like with levers

68
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:52,909
it some some way like with levers
 

69
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,539
it some some way like with levers
I've also redone the top part and I kind

70
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:56,549
I've also redone the top part and I kind
 

71
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,069
I've also redone the top part and I kind
of like this we got these like beams

72
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
of like this we got these like beams
 

73
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,060
of like this we got these like beams
going across now pretty cool we still

74
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
going across now pretty cool we still
 

75
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,520
going across now pretty cool we still
have our lookouts through the iron bars

76
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,530
have our lookouts through the iron bars
 

77
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,180
have our lookouts through the iron bars
and if we go outside it looks relatively

78
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,190
and if we go outside it looks relatively
 

79
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,249
and if we go outside it looks relatively
decent too

80
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:10,259
decent too
 

81
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:18,110
decent too
um walk faster so slow so sand doesn't

82
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,120
um walk faster so slow so sand doesn't
 

83
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,979
um walk faster so slow so sand doesn't
help either all right so this is what it

84
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:21,989
help either all right so this is what it
 

85
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,740
help either all right so this is what it
looks like from the outside oh hey guy

86
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,750
looks like from the outside oh hey guy
 

87
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,759
looks like from the outside oh hey guy
how you doing tonight oh come on I wanna

88
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:31,769
how you doing tonight oh come on I wanna

Ariel and he died oh we did get it sweet

92
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:41,420
Ariel and he died oh we did get it sweet
 

93
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,479
Ariel and he died oh we did get it sweet
okay so it looks pretty good from the

94
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:44,489
okay so it looks pretty good from the
 

95
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,569
okay so it looks pretty good from the
outside let's just earliest I'm content

96
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:47,579
outside let's just earliest I'm content
 

97
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,819
outside let's just earliest I'm content
with it you know I could get super fancy

98
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:49,829
with it you know I could get super fancy
 

99
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,360
with it you know I could get super fancy
but then the problem is it's going to

100
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,370
but then the problem is it's going to
 

101
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,849
but then the problem is it's going to
take a really long time to build a

102
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:55,859
take a really long time to build a
 

103
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,330
take a really long time to build a
tunnel if we do anything too crazy even

104
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,340
tunnel if we do anything too crazy even
 

105
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,979
tunnel if we do anything too crazy even
this took a long time because there's

106
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:00,989
this took a long time because there's
 

107
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,099
this took a long time because there's
this a lot to it if we keep going

108
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:04,109
this a lot to it if we keep going
 

109
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,410
this a lot to it if we keep going
further this way we get to another

110
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:06,420
further this way we get to another
 

111
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,619
further this way we get to another
fortress where I do most of the wither

112
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:09,629
fortress where I do most of the wither
 

113
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:17,240
fortress where I do most of the wither
skull hunting over this way and just

114
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,250
skull hunting over this way and just
 

115
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,979
skull hunting over this way and just
barely see a fortress there that's where

116
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:18,989
barely see a fortress there that's where
 

117
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,140
barely see a fortress there that's where
the dual blades farm is in there so

118
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,150
the dual blades farm is in there so
 

119
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,860
the dual blades farm is in there so
we'll probably have this go this way at

120
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:24,870
we'll probably have this go this way at
 

121
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,869
we'll probably have this go this way at
some point then up ahead here I better

122
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:29,879
some point then up ahead here I better
 

123
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,339
some point then up ahead here I better
save some of these ender pearls or we're

124
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:31,349
save some of these ender pearls or we're
 

125
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,939
save some of these ender pearls or we're
going to run out very quickly and then

126
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:34,949
going to run out very quickly and then
 

127
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,099
going to run out very quickly and then
this it this is to the stronghold so

128
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:37,109
this it this is to the stronghold so
 

129
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,390
this it this is to the stronghold so
this is the first Junction we're going

130
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
this is the first Junction we're going
 

131
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,740
this is the first Junction we're going
to work on because this is a really

132
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:39,750
to work on because this is a really
 

133
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,030
to work on because this is a really
important place to do and silver fish

134
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
important place to do and silver fish
 

135
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,839
important place to do and silver fish
farm and all that stuff all right so if

136
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:50,849
farm and all that stuff all right so if
 

137
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,849
farm and all that stuff all right so if
you guys remember the plan is to make an

138
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:52,859
you guys remember the plan is to make an
 

139
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,189
you guys remember the plan is to make an
intelligent track a track where the

140
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:55,199
intelligent track a track where the
 

141
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,629
intelligent track a track where the
carts know where we're going oh yeah and

142
00:03:59,629 --> 00:03:59,639
carts know where we're going oh yeah and
 

143
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,610
carts know where we're going oh yeah and
by the way out of all these styles

144
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:01,620
by the way out of all these styles
 

145
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,470
by the way out of all these styles
they've been trying we're going to go

146
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
they've been trying we're going to go
 

147
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,949
they've been trying we're going to go
with this first one I think the main

148
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
with this first one I think the main
 

149
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,740
with this first one I think the main
thing I got to watch out for here is I

150
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:09,750
thing I got to watch out for here is I
 

151
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,020
thing I got to watch out for here is I
got to make sure there's no air spaces

152
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,030
got to make sure there's no air spaces
 

153
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,599
got to make sure there's no air spaces
on the left and right of these tracks

154
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:14,609
on the left and right of these tracks
 

155
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,330
on the left and right of these tracks
and with this it's like stare stare

156
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,340
and with this it's like stare stare
 

157
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,140
and with this it's like stare stare
stare lever stare stare stare both sides

158
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,150
stare lever stare stare stare both sides
 

159
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,780
stare lever stare stare stare both sides
no air spaces if there's air spaces

160
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:26,790
no air spaces if there's air spaces
 

161
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,640
no air spaces if there's air spaces
right next to a track you're going to

162
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,650
right next to a track you're going to
 

163
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,730
right next to a track you're going to
get a lot of zombie pigman on your track

164
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:31,740
get a lot of zombie pigman on your track
 

165
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,680
get a lot of zombie pigman on your track
and with my setup here there's going to

166
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:33,690
and with my setup here there's going to
 

167
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,610
and with my setup here there's going to
be at least two blocks beside that won't

168
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:37,620
be at least two blocks beside that won't
 

169
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,219
be at least two blocks beside that won't
be air so you shouldn't get too many

170
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:40,229
be air so you shouldn't get too many
 

171
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,520
be air so you shouldn't get too many
zombie pigman once this is all done even

172
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,530
zombie pigman once this is all done even
 

173
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,650
zombie pigman once this is all done even
as it is now I don't get too many but

174
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
as it is now I don't get too many but
 

175
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,170
as it is now I don't get too many but
you know if a car hits a zombie pigman

176
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
you know if a car hits a zombie pigman
 

177
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,370
you know if a car hits a zombie pigman
it's going to cause some trouble

178
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,380
it's going to cause some trouble
 

179
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,020
it's going to cause some trouble
although they wait a minute they

180
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,030
although they wait a minute they
 

181
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,590
although they wait a minute they
probably avoid it now don't they that is

182
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
probably avoid it now don't they that is
 

183
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,810
probably avoid it now don't they that is
a that's a good question but yeah what

184
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:02,820
a that's a good question but yeah what
 

185
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,260
a that's a good question but yeah what
we're going to do I had this idea to use

186
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,270
we're going to do I had this idea to use
 

187
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,900
we're going to do I had this idea to use
a hopper minecarts okay so you get a

188
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:08,910
a hopper minecarts okay so you get a
 

189
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,640
a hopper minecarts okay so you get a
minecart and a hopper um these buttons

190
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,650
minecart and a hopper um these buttons
 

191
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,430
minecart and a hopper um these buttons
here these these destination selector

192
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
here these these destination selector
 

193
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,129
here these these destination selector
buttons they're going to release one out

194
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,139
buttons they're going to release one out
 

195
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,920
buttons they're going to release one out
of ten unique items so I think we're

196
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:21,930
of ten unique items so I think we're
 

197
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,310
of ten unique items so I think we're
going to set up some dispensers here and

198
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
going to set up some dispensers here and
 

199
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,050
going to set up some dispensers here and
each of those will send out a unique

200
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,060
each of those will send out a unique
 

201
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,159
each of those will send out a unique
item and hopper minecart will go in

202
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:31,169
item and hopper minecart will go in
 

203
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,730
item and hopper minecart will go in
front of us when it goes over item the

204
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:34,740
front of us when it goes over item the
 

205
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,650
front of us when it goes over item the
dispensers release it's going to pick it

206
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:36,660
dispensers release it's going to pick it
 

207
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,350
dispensers release it's going to pick it
up oh that wasn't too smart that that

208
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360
up oh that wasn't too smart that that
 

209
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,980
up oh that wasn't too smart that that
card is gone let's do this again

210
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:45,990
card is gone let's do this again
 

211
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,140
card is gone let's do this again
I forgot I got the power to all these

212
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,150
I forgot I got the power to all these
 

213
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,430
I forgot I got the power to all these
now let's make another one alright give

214
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
now let's make another one alright give
 

215
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,649
now let's make another one alright give
it a ghast here and we'll make it go

216
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:57,659
it a ghast here and we'll make it go
 

217
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,250
it a ghast here and we'll make it go
this way but yeah these hopper mine

218
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,260
this way but yeah these hopper mine
 

219
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,620
this way but yeah these hopper mine
carts they pick stuff up off the track

220
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,630
carts they pick stuff up off the track
 

221
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,670
carts they pick stuff up off the track
all right and then when it goes over

222
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
all right and then when it goes over
 

223
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,659
all right and then when it goes over
another hopper that matches that item

224
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:11,669
another hopper that matches that item
 

225
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,180
another hopper that matches that item
then it's going to tell the junction to

226
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,190
then it's going to tell the junction to
 

227
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,200
then it's going to tell the junction to
switch that way and should work out

228
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,210
switch that way and should work out
 

229
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,580
switch that way and should work out
pretty good

230
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,590
pretty good
 

231
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,830
pretty good
I would think so if we go back here on

232
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
I would think so if we go back here on
 

233
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,600
I would think so if we go back here on
this is where our buttons are I figure

234
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,610
this is where our buttons are I figure
 

235
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,210
this is where our buttons are I figure
we'll use the length of the wire to

236
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,220
we'll use the length of the wire to
 

237
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,529
we'll use the length of the wire to
trigger the dispensers somehow although

238
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:33,539
trigger the dispensers somehow although
 

239
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,209
trigger the dispensers somehow although
that might be a little tough to do I'm

240
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:35,219
that might be a little tough to do I'm
 

241
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,339
that might be a little tough to do I'm
not sure let's just stick this out and

242
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:37,349
not sure let's just stick this out and
 

243
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:37,850
not sure let's just stick this out and
see where

244
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:37,860
see where
 

245
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,610
see where
this is a wire here we should run into

246
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:43,620
this is a wire here we should run into
 

247
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,670
this is a wire here we should run into
our tunnel somewhere around here there

248
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
our tunnel somewhere around here there
 

249
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,860
our tunnel somewhere around here there
it is okay so we got one two three four

250
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:51,870
it is okay so we got one two three four
 

251
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,640
it is okay so we got one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten ten blocks

252
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,650
five six seven eight nine ten ten blocks
 

253
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:08,629
five six seven eight nine ten ten blocks
here and we'll just mark that okay I'm

254
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
here and we'll just mark that okay I'm
 

255
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,189
here and we'll just mark that okay I'm
gonna do a little bit off-camera here

256
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
gonna do a little bit off-camera here
 

257
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,260
gonna do a little bit off-camera here
and try to get this going and then I'll

258
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,270
and try to get this going and then I'll
 

259
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,969
and try to get this going and then I'll
bring you guys back in oh boy we have a

260
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:16,979
bring you guys back in oh boy we have a
 

261
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,619
bring you guys back in oh boy we have a
big problem here

262
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:18,629
big problem here
 

263
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,890
big problem here
big big problem I kind of made some

264
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:21,900
big big problem I kind of made some
 

265
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,749
big big problem I kind of made some
assumptions here that I shouldn't have

266
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
assumptions here that I shouldn't have
 

267
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,600
assumptions here that I shouldn't have
these hopper mine carts I thought they

268
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,610
these hopper mine carts I thought they
 

269
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,600
these hopper mine carts I thought they
worked like normal hoppers like like

270
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,610
worked like normal hoppers like like
 

271
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,189
worked like normal hoppers like like
they would have similar behavior like if

272
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
they would have similar behavior like if
 

273
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,830
they would have similar behavior like if
this went over top this hopper I thought

274
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
this went over top this hopper I thought
 

275
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,119
this went over top this hopper I thought
the items would pass through but it's it

276
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:38,129
the items would pass through but it's it
 

277
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:47,209
the items would pass through but it's it
turns out you can tell by my tone it

278
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:47,219
turns out you can tell by my tone it
 

279
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:53,089
turns out you can tell by my tone it
works okay what the heck I just tried

280
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:53,099
works okay what the heck I just tried
 

281
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,990
works okay what the heck I just tried
this and it didn't work

282
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000

 

283
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,640

turn it again

284
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:58,650
turn it again
 

285
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,680
turn it again
I don't know what's going on I swear I

286
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:02,690
I don't know what's going on I swear I
 

287
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:11,659
I don't know what's going on I swear I
just tried this and it failed not that I

288
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:11,669
just tried this and it failed not that I
 

289
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,330
just tried this and it failed not that I
wanted to fail this is good news dude

290
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,340
wanted to fail this is good news dude
 

291
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,499
wanted to fail this is good news dude
okay never mind this will work so this

292
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:21,509
okay never mind this will work so this
 

293
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,570
okay never mind this will work so this
is the idea like we're going to make it

294
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,580
is the idea like we're going to make it
 

295
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,620
is the idea like we're going to make it
so this hopper will only receive items

296
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,630
so this hopper will only receive items
 

297
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,990
so this hopper will only receive items
of its time like for example if we

298
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
of its time like for example if we
 

299
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,149
of its time like for example if we
wanted it just to take stairs we would

300
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
wanted it just to take stairs we would
 

301
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,060
wanted it just to take stairs we would
do something like that

302
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,070
do something like that
 

303
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,730
do something like that
in reading no we're good

304
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:37,740
in reading no we're good
 

305
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,060
in reading no we're good
and then like if you had if you had a

306
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,070
and then like if you had if you had a
 

307
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,100
and then like if you had if you had a
block that didn't match in the in the

308
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,110
block that didn't match in the in the
 

309
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,750
block that didn't match in the in the
carts it won't go through so that's

310
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
carts it won't go through so that's
 

311
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,120
carts it won't go through so that's
that's the plan with this and I've

312
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,130
that's the plan with this and I've
 

313
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,070
that's the plan with this and I've
changed the selector panel because this

314
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
changed the selector panel because this
 

315
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,140
changed the selector panel because this
style wasn't really working for me

316
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,150
style wasn't really working for me
 

317
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,090
style wasn't really working for me
the way this one works it's inverted

318
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,100
the way this one works it's inverted
 

319
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,630
the way this one works it's inverted
which means like four of these Pistons

320
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
which means like four of these Pistons
 

321
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,220
which means like four of these Pistons
are up right now and only one of them's

322
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,230
are up right now and only one of them's
 

323
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,430
are up right now and only one of them's
down we it's kind of hard to control

324
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
down we it's kind of hard to control
 

325
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,670
down we it's kind of hard to control
dispensers with this setup we can invert

326
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:10,680
dispensers with this setup we can invert
 

327
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,090
dispensers with this setup we can invert
this but it'll get a bit bulkier which

328
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,100
this but it'll get a bit bulkier which
 

329
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,150
this but it'll get a bit bulkier which
is fine but then the power is going to

330
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,160
is fine but then the power is going to
 

331
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,250
is fine but then the power is going to
come out from the side like we would

332
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,260
come out from the side like we would
 

333
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,699
come out from the side like we would
have to put our dispensers over here

334
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:22,709
have to put our dispensers over here
 

335
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,079
have to put our dispensers over here
like what we would have to deal just

336
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:24,089
like what we would have to deal just
 

337
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,070
like what we would have to deal just
I'll just show you real quick here to

338
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll just show you real quick here to
 

339
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,780
I'll just show you real quick here to
get the power out from this thing we

340
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:29,790
get the power out from this thing we
 

341
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,970
get the power out from this thing we
would need

342
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:31,980
would need
 

343
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,210
would need
a repeater here hello heard you oh where

344
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
a repeater here hello heard you oh where
 

345
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:49,760
a repeater here hello heard you oh where
are you going crazy repeater okay um not

346
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:49,770
are you going crazy repeater okay um not
 

347
00:09:49,770 --> 00:10:04,220
are you going crazy repeater okay um not
sure what's going on now um what I'm not

348
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,230
sure what's going on now um what I'm not
 

349
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,600
sure what's going on now um what I'm not
in okay whatever yeah like that and then

350
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:08,610
in okay whatever yeah like that and then
 

351
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,940
in okay whatever yeah like that and then
to a torch so we'd have to do that for

352
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:10,950
to a torch so we'd have to do that for
 

353
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,890
to a torch so we'd have to do that for
the whole row and then put our

354
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:12,900
the whole row and then put our
 

355
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,480
the whole row and then put our
dispensers here but I kind of want that

356
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,490
dispensers here but I kind of want that
 

357
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,540
dispensers here but I kind of want that
out our output to be on the top or the

358
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:17,550
out our output to be on the top or the
 

359
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,330
out our output to be on the top or the
bottom would be most convenient which

360
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:20,340
bottom would be most convenient which
 

361
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,070
bottom would be most convenient which
doesn't really work with this setup so

362
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,080
doesn't really work with this setup so
 

363
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,600
doesn't really work with this setup so
instead we're going to use that other

364
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:26,610
instead we're going to use that other
 

365
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,360
instead we're going to use that other
selector panel I made just recently

366
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,370
selector panel I made just recently
 

367
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,630

animated tutorial on and I got it set up

368
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
animated tutorial on and I got it set up
 

369
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,580
animated tutorial on and I got it set up
over here already so with this set up

370
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:37,590
over here already so with this set up
 

371
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,620
over here already so with this set up
all the lights are off except the one

372
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,630
all the lights are off except the one
 

373
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,250
all the lights are off except the one
that we have selected we're getting a

374
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,260
that we have selected we're getting a
 

375
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,290
that we have selected we're getting a
little bit of lag from this because of

376
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,300
little bit of lag from this because of
 

377
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,860
little bit of lag from this because of
the snapshot the zero seven a there's

378
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:48,870
the snapshot the zero seven a there's
 

379
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,830
the snapshot the zero seven a there's
lighting issues but if we turn smooth

380
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,840
lighting issues but if we turn smooth
 

381
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,700
lighting issues but if we turn smooth
lighting off it will it runs really

382
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:55,710
lighting off it will it runs really
 

383
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,610
lighting off it will it runs really
smooth so I'm guessing this will get

384
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:58,620
smooth so I'm guessing this will get
 

385
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,960
smooth so I'm guessing this will get
fixed in the future patch

386
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:01,970
fixed in the future patch
 

387
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,410
fixed in the future patch
oh boy okay more problems bigger

388
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:08,420
oh boy okay more problems bigger
 

389
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,980
oh boy okay more problems bigger
problems

390
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:08,990
problems
 

391
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,240
problems
ah I'll be honest with you I thought

392
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
ah I'll be honest with you I thought
 

393
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,889
ah I'll be honest with you I thought
that the biggest problem is going to

394
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:14,899
that the biggest problem is going to
 

395
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,439
that the biggest problem is going to
have with this like the the toughest in

396
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:17,449
have with this like the the toughest in
 

397
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:18,970
have with this like the the toughest in
the bureau I thought was going to be

398
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:18,980
the bureau I thought was going to be
 

399
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,650
the bureau I thought was going to be
this whole selector panel issue how do

400
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:20,660
this whole selector panel issue how do
 

401
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,369
this whole selector panel issue how do
we get a unique item into a hopper and

402
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:24,379
we get a unique item into a hopper and
 

403
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,759
we get a unique item into a hopper and
onto the track in the nether because we

404
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:27,769
onto the track in the nether because we
 

405
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,300
onto the track in the nether because we
can't use water to move items where we

406
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,310
can't use water to move items where we
 

407
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,470
can't use water to move items where we
want really um so I thought this hopper

408
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
want really um so I thought this hopper
 

409
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,920
want really um so I thought this hopper
minecarts idea was the ticket to getting

410
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:38,930
minecarts idea was the ticket to getting
 

411
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,850
minecarts idea was the ticket to getting
this all done today

412
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:39,860
this all done today
 

413
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,240
this all done today
and it is definitely a good idea I would

414
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,250
and it is definitely a good idea I would
 

415
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,800
and it is definitely a good idea I would
say so let's just do this real quick

416
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:46,810
say so let's just do this real quick
 

417
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,019
say so let's just do this real quick
what this is the the wiring for my

418
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:50,029
what this is the the wiring for my
 

419
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,439
what this is the the wiring for my
selector panel by the way so I can I can

420
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:53,449
selector panel by the way so I can I can
 

421
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,449
selector panel by the way so I can I can
get the input from the top here really

422
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:55,459
get the input from the top here really
 

423
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,819
get the input from the top here really
easily and I'm going to have dispensers

424
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:57,829
easily and I'm going to have dispensers
 

425
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,389
easily and I'm going to have dispensers
with unique items in each of these at

426
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
with unique items in each of these at
 

427
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,850
with unique items in each of these at
the top and then we have tracks on top

428
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:06,860
the top and then we have tracks on top
 

429
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,449
the top and then we have tracks on top
of this so basically when we hit the

430
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:10,459
of this so basically when we hit the
 

431
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,519
of this so basically when we hit the
button we're going to have another

432
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,529
button we're going to have another
 

433
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,650
button we're going to have another
dispenser somewhere that's going to

434
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:14,660
dispenser somewhere that's going to
 

435
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,889
dispenser somewhere that's going to
dispense hopper minecart onto the track

436
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:17,899
dispense hopper minecart onto the track
 

437
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:20,590
dispense hopper minecart onto the track
or release some opera minecart onto the

438
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
or release some opera minecart onto the
 

439
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,980
or release some opera minecart onto the
track and it's going to pick up

440
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:23,990
track and it's going to pick up
 

441
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,170
track and it's going to pick up
whichever of these items gets shot out

442
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:26,180
whichever of these items gets shot out
 

443
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,819
whichever of these items gets shot out
so let's try this out we got stone there

444
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:29,829
so let's try this out we got stone there
 

445
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,230
so let's try this out we got stone there
but nether acting that one logging that

446
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,240
but nether acting that one logging that
 

447
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,429
but nether acting that one logging that
one one of these oh I put two of those

448
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:39,439
one one of these oh I put two of those
 

449
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,759
one one of these oh I put two of those
and that's okay so now if we go down

450
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:42,769
and that's okay so now if we go down
 

451
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,819
and that's okay so now if we go down
here and we make a selection only one of

452
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:45,829
here and we make a selection only one of
 

453
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:50,259
here and we make a selection only one of
those should shoot outs and the hopper

454
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:50,269
those should shoot outs and the hopper
 

455
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,299
those should shoot outs and the hopper
minecart will only pick up one right so

456
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:52,309
minecart will only pick up one right so
 

457
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,329
minecart will only pick up one right so
pick that one and here's the dispenser

458
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:57,339
pick that one and here's the dispenser
 

459
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,269
pick that one and here's the dispenser
go back up we should see the second one

460
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:00,279
go back up we should see the second one
 

461
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:07,650
go back up we should see the second one
over yeah right there so we selected

462
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:07,660
over yeah right there so we selected
 

463
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,710
over yeah right there so we selected
this one yep and the hopper minecart

464
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:13,720
this one yep and the hopper minecart
 

465
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,400
this one yep and the hopper minecart
would go by pick that up do a hook

466
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,410
would go by pick that up do a hook
 

467
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,939
would go by pick that up do a hook
around and then go down to our track

468
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:20,949
around and then go down to our track
 

469
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:26,009
around and then go down to our track
right and then we would get released so

470
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:26,019
right and then we would get released so
 

471
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,360
right and then we would get released so
I got my head around that

472
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,370
I got my head around that
 

473
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,280
I got my head around that
the next problem I'm having though I

474
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,290
the next problem I'm having though I
 

475
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,749
the next problem I'm having though I
didn't think these hoppers were going to

476
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:30,759
didn't think these hoppers were going to
 

477
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,329
didn't think these hoppers were going to
be such a big issue but they are they're

478
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:33,339
be such a big issue but they are they're
 

479
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:40,980
be such a big issue but they are they're
they're pretty complicated so - let's do

480
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:40,990
they're pretty complicated so - let's do
 

481
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,840
they're pretty complicated so - let's do
this let's get some power going here

482
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:44,850
this let's get some power going here
 

483
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,069
this let's get some power going here
here's one of the big issues I was

484
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:47,079
here's one of the big issues I was
 

485
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,049
here's one of the big issues I was
having which I think I got figured out

486
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:49,059
having which I think I got figured out
 

487
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:55,470
having which I think I got figured out
now but you see this like we can hold

488
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
now but you see this like we can hold
 

489
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,290
now but you see this like we can hold
the item in there and then only stone

490
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,300
the item in there and then only stone
 

491
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,769
the item in there and then only stone
will be able to enter right no because

492
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:01,779
will be able to enter right no because
 

493
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,749
will be able to enter right no because
we can't actually get an item to go in

494
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:03,759
we can't actually get an item to go in
 

495
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,710
we can't actually get an item to go in
now because it's locked all right cool

496
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:07,720
now because it's locked all right cool
 

497
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,519
now because it's locked all right cool
if we lock the one below that if we lock

498
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:14,529
if we lock the one below that if we lock
 

499
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:20,480
if we lock the one below that if we lock
the one below that we have a new problem

500
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,490

 

501
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,780

all the items we put in this top one

502
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:23,790
all the items we put in this top one
 

503
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,139
all the items we put in this top one
will go down into that so we won't we

504
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:28,149
will go down into that so we won't we
 

505
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:31,019
will go down into that so we won't we
won't be able to detect what or like

506
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:31,029
won't be able to detect what or like
 

507
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,960
won't be able to detect what or like
prevents like any item that passes over

508
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:33,970
prevents like any item that passes over
 

509
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,970
prevents like any item that passes over
this hopper at the top we'll just go

510
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:35,980
this hopper at the top we'll just go
 

511
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,160
this hopper at the top we'll just go
down through it and we won't be able to

512
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,170
down through it and we won't be able to
 

513
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,840
down through it and we won't be able to
detect the unique ID of the item right

514
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:41,850
detect the unique ID of the item right
 

515
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,129
detect the unique ID of the item right
so I did come up with a solution with

516
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:44,139
so I did come up with a solution with
 

517
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,480
so I did come up with a solution with
that and I'm going to build it in this

518
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,490
that and I'm going to build it in this
 

519
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,249
that and I'm going to build it in this
world I was messing around and creative

520
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:47,259
world I was messing around and creative
 

521
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,990
world I was messing around and creative
for about half an hour here trying to

522
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,000
for about half an hour here trying to
 

523
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,740
for about half an hour here trying to
figure this out I'll rebuild it here and

524
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:52,750
figure this out I'll rebuild it here and
 

525
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,499
figure this out I'll rebuild it here and
just show you what I had whoo party look

526
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:58,509
just show you what I had whoo party look
 

527
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,919
just show you what I had whoo party look
at them all I've never seen this many in

528
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:01,929
at them all I've never seen this many in
 

529
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:07,439
at them all I've never seen this many in
here alright so check it out this is my

530
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:07,449
here alright so check it out this is my
 

531
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,840
here alright so check it out this is my
solution to the problem I was having

532
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:09,850
solution to the problem I was having
 

533
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,200
solution to the problem I was having
it's like a cutaway of how one of my

534
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,210
it's like a cutaway of how one of my
 

535
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,350
it's like a cutaway of how one of my
hopper junctions would work here so this

536
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,360
hopper junctions would work here so this
 

537
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,590
hopper junctions would work here so this
all looks good to me like this should

538
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
all looks good to me like this should
 

539
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,110
all looks good to me like this should
work but it doesn't and I'll tell you

540
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,120
work but it doesn't and I'll tell you
 

541
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,410
work but it doesn't and I'll tell you
why in just a second and this kind of

542
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,420
why in just a second and this kind of
 

543
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,020
why in just a second and this kind of
shocked me but this is a solution I came

544
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,030
shocked me but this is a solution I came
 

545
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,210
shocked me but this is a solution I came
up with for the whole hopper problem we

546
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,220
up with for the whole hopper problem we
 

547
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,420
up with for the whole hopper problem we
can use a minecarts storage minecarts

548
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,430
can use a minecarts storage minecarts
 

549
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,170
can use a minecarts storage minecarts
that will bounce back and forth if

550
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:36,180
that will bounce back and forth if
 

551
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,920
that will bounce back and forth if
there's an item in here so I got this

552
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:40,930
there's an item in here so I got this
 

553
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,700
there's an item in here so I got this
set up so it'll only hold 22 items so we

554
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:44,710
set up so it'll only hold 22 items so we
 

555
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,700
set up so it'll only hold 22 items so we
can do this like we want this thing is

556
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:47,710
can do this like we want this thing is
 

557
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,050
can do this like we want this thing is
going to bounce back and forth until

558
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,060
going to bounce back and forth until
 

559
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,180
going to bounce back and forth until
there's 22 left in this hopper

560
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,190
there's 22 left in this hopper
 

561
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,790
there's 22 left in this hopper
and then it'll stop then if we we can

562
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
and then it'll stop then if we we can
 

563
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,920
and then it'll stop then if we we can
still add items in from the top

564
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:00,930

 

565
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,660

beautiful like it just picked up the one

566
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:03,670
beautiful like it just picked up the one
 

567
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,290
beautiful like it just picked up the one
and it sent a redstone signal which we

568
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:07,300
and it sent a redstone signal which we
 

569
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,580
and it sent a redstone signal which we
use to control this Junction but this is

570
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:11,590
use to control this Junction but this is
 

571
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,300
use to control this Junction but this is
the kicker this is the problem oh this

572
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,310
the kicker this is the problem oh this
 

573
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,900
the kicker this is the problem oh this
is a sad news I got today I thought like

574
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:18,910
is a sad news I got today I thought like
 

575
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,670
is a sad news I got today I thought like
that like they did do some changes with

576
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:20,680
that like they did do some changes with
 

577
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
that like they did do some changes with
the hoppers I thought they were all

578
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:21,730
the hoppers I thought they were all
 

579
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,820
the hoppers I thought they were all
stable and everything where I'm in oh

580
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:23,830
stable and everything where I'm in oh
 

581
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,180
stable and everything where I'm in oh
seven eighty right now but no we still

582
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,190
seven eighty right now but no we still
 

583
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,960
seven eighty right now but no we still
have some pretty big inconsistencies

584
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:29,970
have some pretty big inconsistencies
 

585
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,170
have some pretty big inconsistencies
with hoppers so we put three items in

586
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,180
with hoppers so we put three items in
 

587
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,480
with hoppers so we put three items in
that time before the comparator kicked

588
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,490
that time before the comparator kicked
 

589
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,410
that time before the comparator kicked
in one two three four on the fourth one

590
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:43,420
in one two three four on the fourth one
 

591
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,810
in one two three four on the fourth one
that time it they ticked in you can see

592
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:45,820
that time it they ticked in you can see
 

593
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,230
that time it they ticked in you can see
this Junction switching at time it went

594
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240
this Junction switching at time it went
 

595
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,620
this Junction switching at time it went
on one one we wanted to go on one that's

596
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:52,630
on one one we wanted to go on one that's
 

597
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,140
on one one we wanted to go on one that's
that's what it should do but sometimes I

598
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,150
that's what it should do but sometimes I
 

599
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,740
that's what it should do but sometimes I
don't know why

600
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:02,750

 

601
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,150

I like it's only sending the signal one

602
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,160
I like it's only sending the signal one
 

603
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,210
I like it's only sending the signal one

it's like if I update it like do a block
update then it checks and finally it'll

go so we might want to hold off on this

let's just sleep here and I'll show you
 

623

it's not reliable at the moment so if we
have a hopper minecarts going by let's

have a hopper minecarts going by let's

00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,640
have a hopper minecarts going by let's
just set it up and it has a piece of

634
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,650
just set it up and it has a piece of
 

635
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,540
just set it up and it has a piece of
stone in it it will be able to pass

636
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,550
stone in it it will be able to pass
 

637
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,200
stone in it it will be able to pass
through this hopper as it goes by and if

638
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,210
through this hopper as it goes by and if
 

639
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,370
through this hopper as it goes by and if
does that the junction switches and it

640
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,380
does that the junction switches and it
 

641
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,130
does that the junction switches and it
should go this way I think it picked up

642
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,140
should go this way I think it picked up
 

643
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,930
should go this way I think it picked up
though maybe I think the carts moving

644
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:19,940
though maybe I think the carts moving
 

645
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,280
though maybe I think the carts moving
too fast too at the moment so we slow

646
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,290
too fast too at the moment so we slow
 

647
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,130
too fast too at the moment so we slow
this down a bit it's pretty delicate

648
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:30,140
this down a bit it's pretty delicate
 

649
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,710
this down a bit it's pretty delicate
like that's another consistency I would

650
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
like that's another consistency I would
 

651
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
like that's another consistency I would
like to see changed as well that where

652
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,450
like to see changed as well that where
 

653
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,270
like to see changed as well that where
it will always pass an item through the

654
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
it will always pass an item through the
 

655
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,170
it will always pass an item through the
hopper that would be nice sometimes it

656
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:41,180
hopper that would be nice sometimes it
 

657
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,450
hopper that would be nice sometimes it
does sometimes it doesn't it's more

658
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:46,460
does sometimes it doesn't it's more
 

659
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,340
does sometimes it doesn't it's more
likely though if we move it back a bit

660
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,350

 

661
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,930

and another problem I'm going to have

662
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:52,940
and another problem I'm going to have
 

663
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,970
and another problem I'm going to have
with my setup is the hoppers when you

664
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:54,980
with my setup is the hoppers when you
 

665
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,220
with my setup is the hoppers when you
break a hopper minecart it splits into

666
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,230
break a hopper minecart it splits into
 

667
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,810
break a hopper minecart it splits into
two so I can't just like run it into a

668
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:01,820
two so I can't just like run it into a
 

669
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,740
two so I can't just like run it into a
cactus - and put it in a hopper or

670
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:05,750
cactus - and put it in a hopper or
 

671
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,940
cactus - and put it in a hopper or
anything like that all right so let's

672
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:09,950
anything like that all right so let's
 

673
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,919
anything like that all right so let's
let's hope for the best and let's get up

674
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:11,929
let's hope for the best and let's get up
 

675
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,570
let's hope for the best and let's get up
a little higher so we can see this time

676
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:15,580

 

677
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,930

all right so come on go the right way

678
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:18,940
all right so come on go the right way
 

679
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,070
all right so come on go the right way
nope uh-oh it's my only minecarts did

680
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
nope uh-oh it's my only minecarts did
 

681
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,620
nope uh-oh it's my only minecarts did
the item go out this time no all right

682
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:29,630
the item go out this time no all right
 

683
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,080
the item go out this time no all right
maybe I'll have to mess around with this

684
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,090
maybe I'll have to mess around with this
 

685
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:40,960
maybe I'll have to mess around with this
some more before I can show it oh there

686
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:40,970
some more before I can show it oh there
 

687
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,420
some more before I can show it oh there
is that's what we want so that's that's

688
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,430
is that's what we want so that's that's
 

689
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,210
is that's what we want so that's that's
how this should work

690
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,220
how this should work
 

691
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,380
how this should work
if we do it again though you can see we

692
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,390
if we do it again though you can see we
 

693
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,270
if we do it again though you can see we
don't always have it working

694
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,280
don't always have it working
 

695
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,330
don't always have it working
there's inconsistencies it's like it

696
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,340
there's inconsistencies it's like it
 

697
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,860
there's inconsistencies it's like it
randomly chooses to update sometimes

698
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:58,870
randomly chooses to update sometimes
 

699
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,570
randomly chooses to update sometimes
this is original setup we had to I

700
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:01,580
this is original setup we had to I
 

701
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,070
this is original setup we had to I
didn't I changed it back to this just to

702
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
didn't I changed it back to this just to
 

703
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,280
didn't I changed it back to this just to
prove it yeah that time it went

704
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,290
prove it yeah that time it went
 

705
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,110
prove it yeah that time it went
straights and that did not go out so I

706
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,120
straights and that did not go out so I
 

707
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,270
straights and that did not go out so I
think I think this will work

708
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,280
think I think this will work
 

709
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,690
think I think this will work
eventually I they just need to make

710
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:19,700
eventually I they just need to make
 

711
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,490
eventually I they just need to make
stuff a little more consistent it seems

712
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:21,500
stuff a little more consistent it seems
 

713
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,200
stuff a little more consistent it seems
I hope they do anyway

714
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,210
I hope they do anyway
 

715
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,890
I hope they do anyway
and welcome back to the nether again I I

716
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:29,900
and welcome back to the nether again I I
 

717
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,050
and welcome back to the nether again I I
set up the proof of concept for this

718
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,060
set up the proof of concept for this
 

719
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,950
set up the proof of concept for this
thing I'll just show it to you if we go

720
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:35,960
thing I'll just show it to you if we go
 

721
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,520
thing I'll just show it to you if we go
up here

722
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:38,530
up here
 

723
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,420
up here
down there you can see it was up up up

724
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,430
down there you can see it was up up up
 

725
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,330
down there you can see it was up up up
to this dispenser this this has our

726
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:45,340
to this dispenser this this has our
 

727
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,520
to this dispenser this this has our
hopper minecarts in we'll have to do

728
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,530
hopper minecarts in we'll have to do
 

729
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,780
hopper minecarts in we'll have to do
something different though because like

730
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:48,790
something different though because like
 

731
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,690
something different though because like
I said if we if we try to collect these

732
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:53,700
I said if we if we try to collect these
 

733
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,280
I said if we if we try to collect these
hopper mine carts they'll break into a

734
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,290
hopper mine carts they'll break into a
 

735
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,920
hopper mine carts they'll break into a
mine cart and a hopper and we have no

736
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:58,930
mine cart and a hopper and we have no
 

737
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,930
mine cart and a hopper and we have no
way of putting them back together except

738
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:00,940
way of putting them back together except
 

739
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,590
way of putting them back together except
manually so we may have to store the

740
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,600
manually so we may have to store the
 

741
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,390
manually so we may have to store the
full mine carts not at the item itself

742
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
full mine carts not at the item itself
 

743
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,780
full mine carts not at the item itself
but we come up here and hopper minecart

744
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:12,790
but we come up here and hopper minecart
 

745
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,900
but we come up here and hopper minecart
gets released we have our dispensers

746
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,910
gets released we have our dispensers
 

747
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,240
gets released we have our dispensers
we're going to try select this one the

748
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,250
we're going to try select this one the
 

749
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,720
we're going to try select this one the
one with the women but it it goes around

750
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:21,730
one with the women but it it goes around
 

751
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,240
one with the women but it it goes around
hooks around to the other side in case

752
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,250
hooks around to the other side in case
 

753
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,710
hooks around to the other side in case
we selected something from the side goes

754
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
we selected something from the side goes
 

755
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,540
we selected something from the side goes
down and up through there and then this

756
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:33,550
down and up through there and then this
 

757
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,540
down and up through there and then this
way so if we try it out if we pick this

758
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,550
way so if we try it out if we pick this
 

759
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,820
way so if we try it out if we pick this
middle one we should get a hopper with

760
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:38,830
middle one we should get a hopper with
 

761
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,450
middle one we should get a hopper with
one piece of wooden let's go up you're

762
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:42,460
one piece of wooden let's go up you're
 

763
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:55,430
one piece of wooden let's go up you're
quick to kitchens and I didn't see it

764
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440

 

765
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:05,100

might happen too quick I'm not sure mmm

766
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,110
might happen too quick I'm not sure mmm
 

767
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,690
might happen too quick I'm not sure mmm
okay well there's four in there let's

768
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:06,700
okay well there's four in there let's
 

769
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,570
okay well there's four in there let's
pick that one next we'll know for sure

770
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:09,580
pick that one next we'll know for sure
 

771
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,930
pick that one next we'll know for sure
that way

772
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:12,940

 

773
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:29,879

Oh dangit really oh what a jerk he burns

00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:29,889
Oh dangit really oh what a jerk he burns
 

775
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:35,249
Oh dangit really oh what a jerk he burns
this place down I'm gonna be sad out

776
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:35,259
this place down I'm gonna be sad out
 

777
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:38,629
this place down I'm gonna be sad out
there and get him from here

778
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:38,639

 

779
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:44,969

now gotta you closer don't oh oh he hit

780

now gotta you closer don't oh oh he hit
 

781
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:48,869
now gotta you closer don't oh oh he hit
the sandstone - Wow

782
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:48,879
the sandstone - Wow
 

783
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:56,580
the sandstone - Wow
man Wow okay I'll have to make a note of

784
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:56,590
man Wow okay I'll have to make a note of
 

785
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,710
man Wow okay I'll have to make a note of
that that area out there is not done yet

786
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
that that area out there is not done yet
 

787
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,039
that that area out there is not done yet
so don't worry too much about that and

788
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,049
so don't worry too much about that and
 

789
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:10,820
so don't worry too much about that and
this is all a mess again put that there

790
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:10,830
this is all a mess again put that there
 

791
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,609

807
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,609
what no no that can't be right we might
have to make some refinements this why

808
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:50,619
have to make some refinements this why
 

809
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:58,909
have to make some refinements this why

better but when people play feed the
 

873
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,680
better but when people play feed the
beast they play with a certain style of
