hey guys welcome back this is episode 16
and like I said in our last episode we

4
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:08,389
and like I said in our last episode we
 

5
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:14,930
and like I said in our last episode we
are going to go on a journey we need to

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:14,940
are going to go on a journey we need to
 

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,950
are going to go on a journey we need to
go find some slow sand so that we can

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
go find some slow sand so that we can
 

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,779
go find some slow sand so that we can
invent a timer a mechanical timer for

10
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:23,789
invent a timer a mechanical timer for
 

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:32,840
invent a timer a mechanical timer for
this device so we have a mission we are

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:32,850
this device so we have a mission we are
 

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,530
this device so we have a mission we are
going to the nether down our abandoned

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,540
going to the nether down our abandoned
 

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,709
going to the nether down our abandoned
mine here and we got our portal set up

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
mine here and we got our portal set up
 

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,410
mine here and we got our portal set up
from before and I'm already I think I

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,420
from before and I'm already I think I
 

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:58,340
from before and I'm already I think I
have tons of meats ready to go I even

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,350
have tons of meats ready to go I even
 

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,340
have tons of meats ready to go I even
made a bow and just the show I'm pulling

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,350
made a bow and just the show I'm pulling
 

23
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,920
made a bow and just the show I'm pulling
out the big stops I even made armor I'm

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:09,930
out the big stops I even made armor I'm
 

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,950
out the big stops I even made armor I'm
going to be like indestructible in there

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960

 

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,410

got some flint and steel crafting table

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:22,420

 

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,010

put that there

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,020

 

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:33,130

torches okay so our objectives on our

32
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,140
torches okay so our objectives on our
 

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,240
torches okay so our objectives on our
mission are to one build a small basis

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,250
mission are to one build a small basis
 

35
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:45,580
mission are to one build a small basis
of operations to collect about 30 to

36
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:45,590
of operations to collect about 30 to
 

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,930
of operations to collect about 30 to
slow's hand and three returned alive

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:49,940
slow's hand and three returned alive
 

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,050
slow's hand and three returned alive
with it that's going to be a challenge

40
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,060
with it that's going to be a challenge
 

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,820
with it that's going to be a challenge
and we are playing on hard we're not

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:57,830
and we are playing on hard we're not
 

43
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,859
and we are playing on hard we're not
allowed to go off hard and I've spent

44
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:02,869
allowed to go off hard and I've spent
 

45
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,840
allowed to go off hard and I've spent
about a total of five minutes in the

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:04,850
about a total of five minutes in the
 

47
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,820
about a total of five minutes in the
nether not playing on peaceful so I'm

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:06,830
nether not playing on peaceful so I'm
 

49
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,360
nether not playing on peaceful so I'm
going to totally suck so let's hope for

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,370
going to totally suck so let's hope for
 

51
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:21,610
going to totally suck so let's hope for
the best

52
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:21,620

 

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,710

first time entering the nether in this

54
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
first time entering the nether in this
 

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:34,580
first time entering the nether in this
world that's dar Fetzer speaking gasps

56
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,590
world that's dar Fetzer speaking gasps
 

57
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:53,870
world that's dar Fetzer speaking gasps
to him where is he oh yeah we found slow

58
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:53,880
to him where is he oh yeah we found slow
 

59
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,900
to him where is he oh yeah we found slow
sand already okay

60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:55,910
sand already okay
 

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:09,470
sand already okay
this was easier than I thought yeah

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,480
this was easier than I thought yeah
 

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:28,720
this was easier than I thought yeah
we're going to set up a base here

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:28,730

 

65
00:03:28,730 --> 00:04:38,140

nothing fancy small nose no guests yet

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,150

 

67
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,460

so I don't think these guys attack you

68
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:40,470
so I don't think these guys attack you
 

69
00:04:40,470 --> 00:05:12,379
so I don't think these guys attack you
unless you attack them all right this

70
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:12,389
unless you attack them all right this
 

71
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:45,440
unless you attack them all right this
holes are for Windows this is a lot

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,450
holes are for Windows this is a lot
 

73
00:05:45,450 --> 00:06:14,650
holes are for Windows this is a lot
easier than I suspected oh man

74
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:14,660

 

75
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:36,139

and I brought some glass with us

76
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:36,149

 

77
00:06:36,149 --> 00:07:32,489

and see I think door pretty nice place

78
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:32,499
and see I think door pretty nice place
 

79
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:39,739
and see I think door pretty nice place
to start off we're gonna build a chest

80
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:39,749

 

81
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:52,019

or two and we're actually going to also

82
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:52,029
or two and we're actually going to also
 

83
00:07:52,029 --> 00:08:23,339
or two and we're actually going to also
build the furnace all right I'm gonna

84
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:23,349
build the furnace all right I'm gonna
 

85
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:40,900
build the furnace all right I'm gonna
put some stuff in here

86
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:40,910

 

87
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:50,660

all right so now we have been to harvest

88
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:50,670
all right so now we have been to harvest
 

89
00:08:50,670 --> 00:09:00,740
all right so now we have been to harvest
some of the slow sand amazed there's no

90
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:00,750
some of the slow sand amazed there's no
 

91
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:48,530
some of the slow sand amazed there's no
chance I want to fight them but I'm

92
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,540
chance I want to fight them but I'm
 

93
00:09:48,540 --> 00:10:12,380
chance I want to fight them but I'm
afraid okay this place is overrated this

94
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,390
afraid okay this place is overrated this
 

95
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:21,600
afraid okay this place is overrated this
is so easy

96
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,610

 

97
00:10:21,610 --> 00:11:02,940

oh yeah bullseye oh this is kind of

98
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:02,950
oh yeah bullseye oh this is kind of
 

99
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:33,720
oh yeah bullseye oh this is kind of
boring that's it I gotta say I'm pretty

100
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:33,730
boring that's it I gotta say I'm pretty
 

101
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:45,110
boring that's it I gotta say I'm pretty
disappointed with this place

102
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120

 

103
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,499

all right we're going back

104
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:53,509

 

105
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,820

maybe next time

106
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:58,830

 

107
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:21,829

mission accomplished

108
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839

 

109
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,280

hmm they must not be spawned when you

110
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,290
hmm they must not be spawned when you
 

111
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:52,290
hmm they must not be spawned when you
leave oh yeah

112
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:52,300

 

113
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,820

well I thought we were going to spend

114
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:54,830
well I thought we were going to spend
 

115
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,080
well I thought we were going to spend
the whole episode in there but it was

116
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,090
the whole episode in there but it was
 

117
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,420
the whole episode in there but it was
pretty lame so I guess we'll start

118
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,430
pretty lame so I guess we'll start
 

119
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:18,060
pretty lame so I guess we'll start
trying to figure out how to build timer

120
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,070

 

121
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,880

so we're going to use the slow sand to

122
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:21,890
so we're going to use the slow sand to
 

123
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,480
so we're going to use the slow sand to
slow down the boat so that the timer can

124
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,490
slow down the boat so that the timer can
 

125
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:36,580
slow down the boat so that the timer can
be smaller and going to be a mechanical

126
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:36,590
be smaller and going to be a mechanical
 

127
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,970
be smaller and going to be a mechanical
timer using boats the first thing we got

128
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:42,980
timer using boats the first thing we got
 

129
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,930
timer using boats the first thing we got
to do is figure out how fast boats move

130
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:45,940
to do is figure out how fast boats move
 

131
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:56,620
to do is figure out how fast boats move
they're influenced by slow sand and I

132
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,630
they're influenced by slow sand and I
 

133
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:20,260
they're influenced by slow sand and I
don't know if I have any whip left this

134
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,270
don't know if I have any whip left this
 

135
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,060
don't know if I have any whip left this
is going to get a bit of wood so that

136
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,070
is going to get a bit of wood so that
 

137
00:14:22,070 --> 00:15:00,870
is going to get a bit of wood so that
makes a base

138
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880

 

139
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,230

and we'll just um do some testing over

140
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,240
and we'll just um do some testing over
 

141
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:28,160
and we'll just um do some testing over
here I guess make a few boats

142
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,170

 

143
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,920

all right so I think the first thing

144
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:30,930
all right so I think the first thing
 

145
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,200
all right so I think the first thing
we'll do is we'll dig out a three-wide

146
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,210
we'll do is we'll dig out a three-wide
 

147
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:51,260
we'll do is we'll dig out a three-wide
area maybe beep block song and then

148
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,270
area maybe beep block song and then
 

149
00:15:51,270 --> 00:16:08,360
area maybe beep block song and then
we're going to place our water and we're

150
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,370
we're going to place our water and we're
 

151
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:22,530
we're going to place our water and we're
going to play slow sand all along

152
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:22,540

 

153
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,040

so when we place our boat here get

154
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,050
so when we place our boat here get
 

155
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:42,870
so when we place our boat here get
placed underneath the slow sand or not

156
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880

 

157
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:58,810

right again yeah that's the thing about

158
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:58,820
right again yeah that's the thing about
 

159
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,610
right again yeah that's the thing about
working with boats you go through a lot

160
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:00,620
working with boats you go through a lot
 

161
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:08,740
working with boats you go through a lot
of wood really fast okay come on I

162
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:08,750
of wood really fast okay come on I
 

163
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:24,770
of wood really fast okay come on I
placed it right

164
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:24,780

 

165
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:38,220

last vote that's not good so I think

166
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,230
last vote that's not good so I think
 

167
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,930
last vote that's not good so I think
when the boat starts out it has to be

168
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:39,940
when the boat starts out it has to be
 

169
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,789
when the boat starts out it has to be
under any normal block instead of this

170
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
under any normal block instead of this
 

171
00:17:44,799 --> 00:18:13,990
under any normal block instead of this
whole sand all right round two

172
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000

 

173
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:32,230

mm why isn't that working

174
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240

 

175
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160

all right we're gonna get some pressure

176
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,170
all right we're gonna get some pressure
 

177
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,600
all right we're gonna get some pressure
plates and we're gonna build an ez

178
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:35,610
plates and we're gonna build an ez
 

179
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:56,110
plates and we're gonna build an ez
loader

180
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,120

 

181
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,100

I'm not sure why this isn't working

182
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,110
I'm not sure why this isn't working
 

183
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:30,740
I'm not sure why this isn't working
right it's definitely short now place it

184
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:30,750
right it's definitely short now place it
 

185
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,980
right it's definitely short now place it
in the middle

186
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:36,990

 

187
00:19:36,990 --> 00:20:08,610

okay so we need to make a vote I think

188
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:08,620
okay so we need to make a vote I think
 

189
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,630
okay so we need to make a vote I think
take five minutes

190
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,640
take five minutes
 

191
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,769
take five minutes
going along slow sand like this roughly

192
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:16,779
going along slow sand like this roughly
 

193
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,899
going along slow sand like this roughly
five minutes four minutes is probably

194
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:18,909
five minutes four minutes is probably
 

195
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,970
five minutes four minutes is probably
good so I'm going to time how long this

196
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:23,980
good so I'm going to time how long this
 

197
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,190
good so I'm going to time how long this
takes and then I'll figure out how long

198
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,200
takes and then I'll figure out how long
 

199
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,049
takes and then I'll figure out how long
it needs to be and I'll probably build

200
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:31,059
it needs to be and I'll probably build
 

201
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,870
it needs to be and I'll probably build
it off-camera and then show you when I

202
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:33,880
it off-camera and then show you when I
 

203
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:42,720
it off-camera and then show you when I
get it all figured out

204
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,730

 

205
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,170

yes I just were about out of time here

206
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,180
yes I just were about out of time here
 

207
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,080
yes I just were about out of time here
sorry this episode was kind of boring I

208
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,090
sorry this episode was kind of boring I
 

209
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,030
sorry this episode was kind of boring I
was expecting the episode where we go to

210
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,040
was expecting the episode where we go to
 

211
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,470
was expecting the episode where we go to
the nether to people or anybody it was

212
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:55,480
the nether to people or anybody it was
 

213
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,350
the nether to people or anybody it was
like this world is more dangerous in the

214
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
like this world is more dangerous in the
 

215
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,680
like this world is more dangerous in the
daytime the nether was and so I'm going

216
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:05,690
daytime the nether was and so I'm going
 

217
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,820
daytime the nether was and so I'm going
to measure how long it takes the boats

218
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:06,830
to measure how long it takes the boats
 

219
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,600
to measure how long it takes the boats
to travel one block in when influenced

220
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:10,610
to travel one block in when influenced
 

221
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,210
to travel one block in when influenced
by slow sand and then I'll figure out

222
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,220
by slow sand and then I'll figure out
 

223
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,680
by slow sand and then I'll figure out
how long I need to make the boat go and

224
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:16,690
how long I need to make the boat go and
 

225
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:23,500
how long I need to make the boat go and
I also need to figure out how to so if I

226
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,510
I also need to figure out how to so if I
 

227
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,690
I also need to figure out how to so if I
pick up the items I need it to reset to

228
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:25,700
pick up the items I need it to reset to
 

229
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,560
pick up the items I need it to reset to
back to zero and start counting up to

230
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,570
back to zero and start counting up to
 

231
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,720
back to zero and start counting up to
four minutes again so I'll have to

232
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:31,730
four minutes again so I'll have to
 

233
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,310
four minutes again so I'll have to
figure out how to do that and I'll

234
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,320
figure out how to do that and I'll
 

235
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,160
figure out how to do that and I'll
probably expand our mob room down there

236
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,170
probably expand our mob room down there
 

237
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,990
probably expand our mob room down there
a little bit more to and hopefully start

238
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
a little bit more to and hopefully start
 

239
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,100
a little bit more to and hopefully start
structuring out the storage room a bit

240
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,110
structuring out the storage room a bit
 

241
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,120
structuring out the storage room a bit
but anyway thanks for watching and until

242
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,130
but anyway thanks for watching and until
 

243
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,850
but anyway thanks for watching and until
next time
