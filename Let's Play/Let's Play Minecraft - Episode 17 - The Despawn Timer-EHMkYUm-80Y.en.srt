II throw it here again with episode 17
 

5
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:11,989
II throw it here again with episode 17
and I guess I'm kind of in trouble with

6
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:11,999
and I guess I'm kind of in trouble with
 

7
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,250
and I guess I'm kind of in trouble with
you guys because as Eleanor pointed out

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:15,260
you guys because as Eleanor pointed out
 

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,410
you guys because as Eleanor pointed out
I'm not really upholding my real number

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm not really upholding my real number
 

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,270
I'm not really upholding my real number
for her let's play videos which is I'm

12
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:23,280
for her let's play videos which is I'm
 

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,810
for her let's play videos which is I'm
supposed to be showing you guys stuck by

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:26,820
supposed to be showing you guys stuck by
 

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,070
supposed to be showing you guys stuck by
those as I build it other one and so I'm

16
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,080
those as I build it other one and so I'm
 

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,299
those as I build it other one and so I'm
kind of guilty of that and is like one

18
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:35,309
kind of guilty of that and is like one
 

19
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,509
kind of guilty of that and is like one
guy left the comments it's like whether

20
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:38,519
guy left the comments it's like whether
 

21
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:42,189
guy left the comments it's like whether
at least build the timer on video and

22
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:42,199
at least build the timer on video and
 

23
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,599
at least build the timer on video and
set while I was reading I was like oh

24
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:44,609
set while I was reading I was like oh
 

25
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,489
set while I was reading I was like oh
dang I already have a timer all built

26
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:46,499
dang I already have a timer all built
 

27
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:51,410
dang I already have a timer all built
and everything so yeah I'm sorry about

28
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,420
and everything so yeah I'm sorry about
 

29
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,160
and everything so yeah I'm sorry about
that guys I will I will try build more

30
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,170
that guys I will I will try build more
 

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,150
that guys I will I will try build more
in my videos

32
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,160

 

33
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,930

another guy said you know I would rather

34
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:01,940
another guy said you know I would rather
 

35
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,610
another guy said you know I would rather
watch you bill Jesus mom dude instead of

36
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:07,620
watch you bill Jesus mom dude instead of
 

37
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,630
watch you bill Jesus mom dude instead of
watching you go to the nether but the

38
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:11,640
watching you go to the nether but the
 

39
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,910
watching you go to the nether but the
thing is you know this thing could

40
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
thing is you know this thing could
 

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,890
thing is you know this thing could
probably be built in like 15 minutes

42
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:15,900
probably be built in like 15 minutes
 

43
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,580
probably be built in like 15 minutes
which we've filled in episodes nicely

44
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:18,590
which we've filled in episodes nicely
 

45
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,470
which we've filled in episodes nicely
let me actually inventing this thing and

46
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:21,480
let me actually inventing this thing and
 

47
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,370
let me actually inventing this thing and
working out the kinks and everything but

48
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
working out the kinks and everything but
 

49
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,780
working out the kinks and everything but
well over three hours which would take

50
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:28,790
well over three hours which would take
 

51
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,830
well over three hours which would take
over twelve episodes because I also

52
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
over twelve episodes because I also
 

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,219
over twelve episodes because I also
think slower when I'm trying to I'm

54
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:37,229
think slower when I'm trying to I'm
 

55
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,749
think slower when I'm trying to I'm
trying to talk and build things at the

56
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
trying to talk and build things at the
 

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,980
trying to talk and build things at the
same time so those twelve episodes would

58
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:45,990
same time so those twelve episodes would
 

59
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,160
same time so those twelve episodes would
me would be me just getting late you

60
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,170
me would be me just getting late you
 

61
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,680
me would be me just getting late you
hear those twelve episodes it'd just be

62
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:51,690
hear those twelve episodes it'd just be
 

63
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,999
hear those twelve episodes it'd just be
me walking around incoherently and you

64
00:01:58,999 --> 00:01:59,009
me walking around incoherently and you
 

65
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,639
me walking around incoherently and you
know so I'm trying I'm going to try to

66
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:07,649
know so I'm trying I'm going to try to
 

67
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,059
know so I'm trying I'm going to try to
build more on-camera homes and same with

68
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:11,069
build more on-camera homes and same with
 

69
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:17,300
build more on-camera homes and same with
this timer thing you know I it took well

70
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,310
this timer thing you know I it took well
 

71
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,790
this timer thing you know I it took well
over two hours in science and another

72
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
over two hours in science and another
 

73
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,110
over two hours in science and another
leg hour to wire it and that would be

74
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
leg hour to wire it and that would be
 

75
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,270
leg hour to wire it and that would be
another twelve episodes and nothing

76
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,280
another twelve episodes and nothing
 

77
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,580
another twelve episodes and nothing
would ever get done in our world and I

78
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,590
would ever get done in our world and I
 

79
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,050
would ever get done in our world and I
want to do lots of different things but

80
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,060
want to do lots of different things but
 

81
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,150
want to do lots of different things but
I'm gonna explain how this works in a

82
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,160
I'm gonna explain how this works in a
 

83
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,380
I'm gonna explain how this works in a
sec and episodes after insulter I build

84
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,390
sec and episodes after insulter I build
 

85
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,550
sec and episodes after insulter I build
quantum on camera and I'm going to run

86
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
quantum on camera and I'm going to run
 

87
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,690
quantum on camera and I'm going to run
through you through the thought process

88
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
through you through the thought process
 

89
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,380
through you through the thought process
I had with the timer so in our last

90
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,390
I had with the timer so in our last
 

91
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,090
I had with the timer so in our last
episode episode 16 I started building

92
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,100
episode episode 16 I started building
 

93
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,440
episode episode 16 I started building
this thing pretend these dirt blocks

94
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,450
this thing pretend these dirt blocks
 

95
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,870
this thing pretend these dirt blocks
these floating ones are slow sand

96
00:02:59,870 --> 00:02:59,880
these floating ones are slow sand
 

97
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:15,560
these floating ones are slow sand
and let's get some votes so the concept

98
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,570
and let's get some votes so the concept
 

99
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,590
and let's get some votes so the concept
with this timer was the boat would

100
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:21,600
with this timer was the boat would
 

101
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,230
with this timer was the boat would
travel along here and this would be the

102
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,240
travel along here and this would be the
 

103
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,240
travel along here and this would be the
interval or the time passed and how do I

104
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,250
interval or the time passed and how do I
 

105
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,650
interval or the time passed and how do I
explain this I was going to have a stack

106
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:33,660
explain this I was going to have a stack
 

107
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,430
explain this I was going to have a stack
of boats here so say this the time it

108
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
of boats here so say this the time it
 

109
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,180
of boats here so say this the time it
takes to go from here to and around say

110
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,190
takes to go from here to and around say
 

111
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,430
takes to go from here to and around say
that was 30 seconds to make 5 minutes I

112
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
that was 30 seconds to make 5 minutes I
 

113
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,730
that was 30 seconds to make 5 minutes I
would need 11 boats and what would

114
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:49,740
would need 11 boats and what would
 

115
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,800
would need 11 boats and what would
happen is when a boat gets to here for

116
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:54,810
happen is when a boat gets to here for
 

117
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,680
happen is when a boat gets to here for
example it would send another one and

118
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:57,690
example it would send another one and
 

119
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,450
example it would send another one and
eventually all 11 votes would get sent

120
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,460
eventually all 11 votes would get sent
 

121
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,090
eventually all 11 votes would get sent
they would be stacked here and on this

122
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,100
they would be stacked here and on this
 

123
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,460
they would be stacked here and on this
pressure plate once the 11th boat leaves

124
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,470
pressure plate once the 11th boat leaves
 

125
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,390
pressure plate once the 11th boat leaves
here it would trigger that a 5 minutes

126
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:11,400
here it would trigger that a 5 minutes
 

127
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,500
here it would trigger that a 5 minutes
have passed and then they would go up

128
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,510
have passed and then they would go up
 

129
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,870
have passed and then they would go up
and I started building up what do you

130
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
and I started building up what do you
 

131
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
and I started building up what do you
call it my minecart gates a modified

132
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:23,850
call it my minecart gates a modified
 

133
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,730
call it my minecart gates a modified
version of it here and I modified it so

134
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:28,740
version of it here and I modified it so
 

135
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,230
version of it here and I modified it so
that it would hold a stack of boats and

136
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
that it would hold a stack of boats and
 

137
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,400
that it would hold a stack of boats and
I did that by removing the corner here

138
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,410
I did that by removing the corner here
 

139
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,090
I did that by removing the corner here
so let the corner boat would run against

140
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
so let the corner boat would run against
 

141
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,610
so let the corner boat would run against
this wall here and the corner of the

142
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:43,620
this wall here and the corner of the
 

143
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,830
this wall here and the corner of the
boat would bump into the corner of this

144
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
boat would bump into the corner of this
 

145
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,380
boat would bump into the corner of this
one and then an inverted stack of boats

146
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,390
one and then an inverted stack of boats
 

147
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,720
one and then an inverted stack of boats
would form underneath this boat

148
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,730
would form underneath this boat
 

149
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,540
would form underneath this boat
I'll show you how that worked I think it

150
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,550
I'll show you how that worked I think it
 

151
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:14,290
I'll show you how that worked I think it
still works and obviously this is very

152
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,300
still works and obviously this is very
 

153
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,390
still works and obviously this is very
rough because I never actually finished

154
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
rough because I never actually finished
 

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,130
rough because I never actually finished
this because it was getting stupidly

156
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,140
this because it was getting stupidly
 

157
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,860
this because it was getting stupidly
complicated and big and also so I have

158
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:26,870
complicated and big and also so I have
 

159
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,160
complicated and big and also so I have
an inverted stack of boats here

160
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,170
an inverted stack of boats here
 

161
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,900
an inverted stack of boats here
underneath the minecart Cape thing and

162
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:33,910
underneath the minecart Cape thing and
 

163
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,770
underneath the minecart Cape thing and
so this was to be the reset button so if

164
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:38,780
so this was to be the reset button so if
 

165
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,820
so this was to be the reset button so if
I would pick up the items the timer

166
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:42,830
I would pick up the items the timer
 

167
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,750
I would pick up the items the timer
would get reset and the stack of boats

168
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:46,760
would get reset and the stack of boats
 

169
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,350
would get reset and the stack of boats
would fall back over here onto a stack

170
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,360
would fall back over here onto a stack
 

171
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,600
would fall back over here onto a stack
here and it would go again but then I

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,610
here and it would go again but then I
 

173
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,210
here and it would go again but then I
realized that this inverted thing didn't

174
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,220
realized that this inverted thing didn't
 

175
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,080
realized that this inverted thing didn't
work because the votes do that so I

176
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,090
work because the votes do that so I
 

177
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,810
work because the votes do that so I
would have to make it fall onto the mine

178
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:04,820
would have to make it fall onto the mine
 

179
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,870
would have to make it fall onto the mine
party I kind of had one of those what

180
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
party I kind of had one of those what
 

181
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,430
party I kind of had one of those what
the heck am i doing moments and thought

182
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
the heck am i doing moments and thought
 

183
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,650
the heck am i doing moments and thought
this was way too complicated it's not

184
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:11,660
this was way too complicated it's not
 

185
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,500
this was way too complicated it's not
worth doing and I needed to try

186
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,510
worth doing and I needed to try
 

187
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,330
worth doing and I needed to try
something simpler so this was our first

188
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,340
something simpler so this was our first
 

189
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:26,340
something simpler so this was our first
model then I came up with this idea

190
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,350

 

191
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,650

so the goal with this idea was to make

192
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:29,660
so the goal with this idea was to make
 

193
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,480
so the goal with this idea was to make
the timer simpler and smaller but most

194
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,490
the timer simpler and smaller but most
 

195
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,060
the timer simpler and smaller but most
importantly smaller and as some of you

196
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,070
importantly smaller and as some of you
 

197
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,940
importantly smaller and as some of you
also pointed out in the comments

198
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:39,950
also pointed out in the comments
 

199
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,610

since I'm measuring the time it takes

200
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:42,620
since I'm measuring the time it takes
 

201
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,540
since I'm measuring the time it takes
for an item to de-spawn I should

202
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,550
for an item to de-spawn I should
 

203
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,160
for an item to de-spawn I should
basically just sacrifice an item and

204
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,170
basically just sacrifice an item and
 

205
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,210
basically just sacrifice an item and
when it despond it should trigger that

206
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:52,220
when it despond it should trigger that
 

207
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,750
when it despond it should trigger that
the time is up so I thought I had this

208
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:55,760
the time is up so I thought I had this
 

209
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,690
the time is up so I thought I had this
figured out now I don't know if you can

210
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:58,700
figured out now I don't know if you can
 

211
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,290
figured out now I don't know if you can
see it but I got a door here and a water

212
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,300
see it but I got a door here and a water
 

213
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,850
see it but I got a door here and a water
stream leads up to a pressure plate I

214
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:05,860
stream leads up to a pressure plate I
 

215
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,970
stream leads up to a pressure plate I
figured I need two pressure plates to do

216
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:09,980
figured I need two pressure plates to do
 

217
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,160
figured I need two pressure plates to do
it the first one would be the one that

218
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,170
it the first one would be the one that
 

219
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,250
it the first one would be the one that
has the item that Dee spawns and the

220
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,260
has the item that Dee spawns and the
 

221
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,990
has the item that Dee spawns and the
second one won't be where the items

222
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
second one won't be where the items
 

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,580
second one won't be where the items
would drop so if I had a stream of items

224
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:24,590
would drop so if I had a stream of items
 

225
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,040
would drop so if I had a stream of items
coming first one that hits this pressure

226
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,050
coming first one that hits this pressure
 

227
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,820
coming first one that hits this pressure
plate would open the door and then all

228
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:33,830
plate would open the door and then all
 

229
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,850
plate would open the door and then all
the following items would fall down

230
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:38,860

 

231
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,110

ideally onto another pressure plate but

232
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,120
ideally onto another pressure plate but
 

233
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,240
ideally onto another pressure plate but
then I realized it's impossible to make

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,250
then I realized it's impossible to make
 

235
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,910
then I realized it's impossible to make
the items fall onto a pressure plate

236
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:48,920
the items fall onto a pressure plate
 

237
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,100
the items fall onto a pressure plate
down here because you must have a block

238
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,110
down here because you must have a block
 

239
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,000
down here because you must have a block
underneath the door so I couldn't put a

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,010
underneath the door so I couldn't put a
 

241
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,570
underneath the door so I couldn't put a
pressure plate below here so this idea

242
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:01,580
pressure plate below here so this idea
 

243
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,520
pressure plate below here so this idea
didn't work then I moved on to the next

244
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,530
didn't work then I moved on to the next
 

245
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,670
didn't work then I moved on to the next
idea the same concept except with my

246
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
idea the same concept except with my
 

247
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,610
idea the same concept except with my
minecart date which is broken at the

248
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:15,620
minecart date which is broken at the
 

249
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,950
minecart date which is broken at the
moment it seems

250
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:19,960

 

251
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360

unfortunately but the way this worked

252
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,370
unfortunately but the way this worked
 

253
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,330
unfortunately but the way this worked
was the item stream would come and it

254
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:28,340
was the item stream would come and it
 

255
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,279
was the item stream would come and it
the items you pushed around and when we

256
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:30,289
the items you pushed around and when we
 

257
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,380
the items you pushed around and when we
did this pressure plate the boat would

258
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
did this pressure plate the boat would
 

259
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,800
did this pressure plate the boat would
move out of the way and then the items

260
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:35,810
move out of the way and then the items
 

261
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,990
move out of the way and then the items
would fall down onto another pressure

262
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
would fall down onto another pressure
 

263
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,949
would fall down onto another pressure
plate but the problem was the boat in to

264
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
plate but the problem was the boat in to
 

265
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,170
plate but the problem was the boat in to
occupy a full block space and items

266
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,180
occupy a full block space and items
 

267
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:56,790
occupy a full block space and items
weren't able to make it across so

268
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800

 

269
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,170

anaphor unfortunately the boat is stuck

270
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,180
anaphor unfortunately the boat is stuck
 

271
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,760
anaphor unfortunately the boat is stuck
in the land right now so I can't show

272
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:00,770
in the land right now so I can't show
 

273
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,060
in the land right now so I can't show
you then this was a failed attempt to

274
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,070
you then this was a failed attempt to
 

275
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:16,389
you then this was a failed attempt to
make the boat fit in a block space like

276
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
make the boat fit in a block space like
 

277
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,449
make the boat fit in a block space like
right now this area here is in a full

278
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:19,459
right now this area here is in a full
 

279
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:27,790
right now this area here is in a full
block space this boat but if you adjust

280
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:27,800
block space this boat but if you adjust
 

281
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,860
block space this boat but if you adjust
the levers here you'll notice it just

282
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:32,870
the levers here you'll notice it just
 

283
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:39,160
the levers here you'll notice it just
goes past here that's one two and you

284
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,170
goes past here that's one two and you
 

285
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,930
goes past here that's one two and you
have to treat your reserve time to make

286
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:40,940
have to treat your reserve time to make
 

287
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,340
have to treat your reserve time to make
it stop where we want it well this is

288
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,350
it stop where we want it well this is
 

289
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,990
it stop where we want it well this is
another failed idea and then finally as

290
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
another failed idea and then finally as
 

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,940
another failed idea and then finally as
some of you also suggested in the

292
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:51,950
some of you also suggested in the
 

293
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,790
some of you also suggested in the
comments I should use a dispenser and

294
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
comments I should use a dispenser and
 

295
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,260
comments I should use a dispenser and
that worked awesome

296
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,270

 

297
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,060

so this was my prototype I used to build

298
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,070
so this was my prototype I used to build
 

299
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,310
so this was my prototype I used to build
it first I'll show you at the time how

300
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
it first I'll show you at the time how
 

301
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,530
it first I'll show you at the time how
the timer works and then we'll come back

302
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:08,540
the timer works and then we'll come back
 

303
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:19,970
the timer works and then we'll come back
to there so right now

304
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980

 

305
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:34,850

Oh fine Hey ouch

306
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:34,860
Oh fine Hey ouch
 

307
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:45,830
Oh fine Hey ouch
aah my game is getting laggy Oh

308
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:45,840
aah my game is getting laggy Oh
 

309
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,630
aah my game is getting laggy Oh
oh great starting to think switching to

310
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:53,640
oh great starting to think switching to
 

311
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:11,320
oh great starting to think switching to
a ram just was not a good idea okay

312
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,330

 

313
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,320

idea what the timer was if items would

314
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,330
idea what the timer was if items would
 

315
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,770
idea what the timer was if items would
be spawning and it's time to pick them

316
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:18,780
be spawning and it's time to pick them
 

317
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,180
be spawning and it's time to pick them
up these lights will be flashing there's

318
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,190
up these lights will be flashing there's
 

319
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,750
up these lights will be flashing there's
no items the lights go off and if there

320
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
no items the lights go off and if there
 

321
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,950
no items the lights go off and if there
are items the lights come on though

322
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:36,960
are items the lights come on though
 

323
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,820
are items the lights come on though
we'll just throw an item here and that

324

how this works with this prototype I

340
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:12,750
how this works with this prototype I
 

341
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,220
how this works with this prototype I
built

342
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,230
built
 

343
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,360
built
I built this first this is the one this

344
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,370
I built this first this is the one this
 

345
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,000
I built this first this is the one this
is the pressure plate the items land on

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,010
is the pressure plate the items land on
 

347
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,640
is the pressure plate the items land on
this is the one the feather timer lands

348
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,650
this is the one the feather timer lands
 

349
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,790
this is the one the feather timer lands
on

350
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:27,800
on
 

351
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,050
on
so we'll call this one a this one B so a

352
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,060
so we'll call this one a this one B so a
 

353
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,670
so we'll call this one a this one B so a
connects to a NAND gate here and it also

354
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
connects to a NAND gate here and it also
 

355
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,210
connects to a NAND gate here and it also
connects to the dispenser here which

356
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:41,220
connects to the dispenser here which
 

357
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,910
connects to the dispenser here which
shoots the block which falls on two

358
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
shoots the block which falls on two
 

359
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:54,380
shoots the block which falls on two
pressure plate B the timer plate and the

360
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,390
pressure plate B the timer plate and the
 

361
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,740
pressure plate B the timer plate and the
timer plates pressure plate B has a wire

362
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:57,750
timer plates pressure plate B has a wire
 

363
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,490
timer plates pressure plate B has a wire
that leads over to the and eight as well

364
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:01,500
that leads over to the and eight as well
 

365
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,980
that leads over to the and eight as well
and also there's a five o'clock here

366
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:06,990
and also there's a five o'clock here
 

367
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,220
and also there's a five o'clock here
which triggers the flashing which is

368
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,230
which triggers the flashing which is
 

369
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:16,460
which triggers the flashing which is
connected to the wire as well and then

370
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,470
connected to the wire as well and then
 

371
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,740
connected to the wire as well and then
the signal gets inverted and this is our

372
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:18,750
the signal gets inverted and this is our
 

373
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:28,370
the signal gets inverted and this is our
our light so

374
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,380

 

375
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,450

the feather didn't land on the pressure

376
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,460
the feather didn't land on the pressure
 

377
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,620
the feather didn't land on the pressure
plate yeah that's why I'm using water to

378
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:34,630
plate yeah that's why I'm using water to
 

379
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,240
plate yeah that's why I'm using water to
guide the feather onto the pressure

380
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,250
guide the feather onto the pressure
 

381
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,930
guide the feather onto the pressure
plate to because the dispenser shoots it

382
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:39,940
plate to because the dispenser shoots it
 

383
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,120
plate to because the dispenser shoots it
out unreliably so there's no feather on

384
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,130
out unreliably so there's no feather on
 

385
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,340
out unreliably so there's no feather on
this pressure plate which indicates a

386
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,350
this pressure plate which indicates a
 

387
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,820
this pressure plate which indicates a
theis pond which means it's time to pick

388
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:50,830
theis pond which means it's time to pick
 

389
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,610
theis pond which means it's time to pick
up your items so it was flashing there's

390
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:53,620
up your items so it was flashing there's
 

391
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,720
up your items so it was flashing there's
nothing on it's off if something is on

392
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:57,730
nothing on it's off if something is on
 

393
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:04,950
nothing on it's off if something is on
both of them it stays on because it's

394
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:04,960
both of them it stays on because it's
 

395
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,430
both of them it stays on because it's
sending a signal which overrides the

396
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,440
sending a signal which overrides the
 

397
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,940
sending a signal which overrides the
five o'clock here and goes to the and

398
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:11,950
five o'clock here and goes to the and
 

399
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,440
five o'clock here and goes to the and
eats and I'm using feathers because

400
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,450
eats and I'm using feathers because
 

401
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,370
eats and I'm using feathers because
they're the most useless mob item so I

402
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,380
they're the most useless mob item so I
 

403
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:34,320
they're the most useless mob item so I
don't care if if I lose a few and the

404
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,330
don't care if if I lose a few and the
 

405
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,670
don't care if if I lose a few and the
way this looks over here slower the

406
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:38,680
way this looks over here slower the
 

407
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,850
way this looks over here slower the
volume a bit

408
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,860

 

409
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,400

so the water streams merge and they go

410
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,410
so the water streams merge and they go
 

411
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,640
so the water streams merge and they go
to this one which is when items come

412
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:50,650
to this one which is when items come
 

413
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,860
to this one which is when items come
from

414
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,870
from
 

415
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,789
from
got the dispenser there

416
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:55,799

 

417
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,169

it's like a feather which lands on

418
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:58,179
it's like a feather which lands on
 

419
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:07,379
it's like a feather which lands on
specially and items always come on this

420
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:07,389
specially and items always come on this
 

421
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,789
specially and items always come on this
side of the block the right side the

422
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:11,799
side of the block the right side the
 

423
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,209
side of the block the right side the
dispenser shoots it to the left side so

424
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:15,219
dispenser shoots it to the left side so
 

425
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:18,839
dispenser shoots it to the left side so
they bump together on both pressure

426
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:18,849
they bump together on both pressure
 

427
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:23,369
they bump together on both pressure
plates so that when I pick them up I

428
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:23,379
plates so that when I pick them up I
 

429
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,889
plates so that when I pick them up I
make sure I always grab them off of both

430
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:25,899
make sure I always grab them off of both
 

431
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,289
make sure I always grab them off of both
pressure plates then I got the levers

432
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:31,299
pressure plates then I got the levers
 

433
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:44,609
pressure plates then I got the levers
for the doors Junction still it works

434
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:44,619
for the doors Junction still it works
 

435
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,469
for the doors Junction still it works
pretty good thought time this wire will

436
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:46,479
pretty good thought time this wire will
 

437
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,709
pretty good thought time this wire will
trigger the dispenser even though when I

438
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:49,719
trigger the dispenser even though when I
 

439
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:53,459
trigger the dispenser even though when I
test fitted Dennis like when I when I

440
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:53,469
test fitted Dennis like when I when I
 

441
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,519
test fitted Dennis like when I when I
flip the door Junction I think if

442
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:56,529
flip the door Junction I think if
 

443
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,819
flip the door Junction I think if
there's an item on the pads it does that

444
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:01,829

 

445
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,079

and now it's not shooting a feather out

446
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,089
and now it's not shooting a feather out
 

447
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:11,699
and now it's not shooting a feather out
so and it flashes for a while until the

448
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:11,709
so and it flashes for a while until the
 

449
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,029
so and it flashes for a while until the
first stuff the feather falls down then

450
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:15,039
first stuff the feather falls down then
 

451
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,739
first stuff the feather falls down then
it stops flashing until it be spawns and

452
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:19,749
it stops flashing until it be spawns and
 

453
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:22,979
it stops flashing until it be spawns and
let's go look down at the wiring which

454
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:22,989
let's go look down at the wiring which
 

455
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:30,089
let's go look down at the wiring which
took me a good hour it's gonna head to

456
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:30,099
took me a good hour it's gonna head to
 

457
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:37,969
took me a good hour it's gonna head to
see where to start

458
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:37,979
see where to start
 

459
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:43,559
see where to start
okay so as you ring here next to the two

460
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:43,569
okay so as you ring here next to the two
 

461
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,419
okay so as you ring here next to the two
indicator lights this one here which

where the items land on a little hard to
 

479
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,600
where the items land on a little hard to
move around in here this is what the

480
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:27,610
move around in here this is what the
 

481
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,940
move around in here this is what the
item pressure plate activates and it

482
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,950
item pressure plate activates and it
 

483
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:37,620

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:45,340
over there there's no space in here and
 

487
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,300
over there there's no space in here and
I can't really break out these blocks

488
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,310
I can't really break out these blocks
 

489
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:55,170
I can't really break out these blocks
because there's water above me it sends

490
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,180
because there's water above me it sends
 

491
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,910
because there's water above me it sends
a signal underneath these blocks here

492
00:17:59,910 --> 00:17:59,920

 

493
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,150

so this torch goes up and up and through

494
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
so this torch goes up and up and through
 

495
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:14,700
so this torch goes up and up and through
here and then the dispensers above and

496
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,710
here and then the dispensers above and
 

497
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:23,070
here and then the dispensers above and
it also sends a wire to the antique same

498
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,080
it also sends a wire to the antique same
 

499
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,010
it also sends a wire to the antique same
exact thing is about that I showed you

500
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,020

 

501
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:34,080

and this wire here is from pressure

502
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,090
and this wire here is from pressure
 

503
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,130
and this wire here is from pressure
plate to be one that the these funny
