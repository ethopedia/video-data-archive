121
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,460

32 block range but the only way to

122
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,470
32 block range but the only way to
 

123
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,350
32 block range but the only way to
actually send them somewhere is if I

124
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,360
actually send them somewhere is if I
 

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,450
actually send them somewhere is if I
escort them and send them all at the

161
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,710
that requires sorting mobs but we'll
worry about that another day today what

162
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:11,720
worry about that another day today what
 

163
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:23,040
worry about that another day today what
we're doing is we're trying to make Oh

164
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,050

 

165
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,870

trying to make an automatic record

166
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:27,880
trying to make an automatic record
 

167
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,750
trying to make an automatic record
producer so if a skeleton kills a

168
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:31,760
producer so if a skeleton kills a
 

169
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,350
producer so if a skeleton kills a
creeper he drops a record and we want to

170
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,360
creeper he drops a record and we want to
 

171
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,990
creeper he drops a record and we want to
automate that somehow so that's what

172
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
automate that somehow so that's what
 

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
automate that somehow so that's what
this thing is for I'm not sure how

174
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,210
this thing is for I'm not sure how
 

175
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,520
this thing is for I'm not sure how
exactly I'm going to build it yet but I

176
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,530
exactly I'm going to build it yet but I
 

177
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,860
exactly I'm going to build it yet but I
have a good idea and I wanted to sort

178
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
have a good idea and I wanted to sort
 

179
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,800
have a good idea and I wanted to sort
the mob so that only creepers would go

180
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:53,810
the mob so that only creepers would go
 

181
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,149
the mob so that only creepers would go
in one spot and skeletons in another but

182
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:57,159
in one spot and skeletons in another but
 

183
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,890
in one spot and skeletons in another but
I've realized that I don't really need

184
00:06:59,890 --> 00:06:59,900
I've realized that I don't really need
 

185
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,850
I've realized that I don't really need
to sort them it actually be faster not

186
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:03,860
to sort them it actually be faster not
 

187
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,519
to sort them it actually be faster not
to them not to sort them that

188
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,529
to them not to sort them that
 

189
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:17,929
to them not to sort them that
I feel like I'm slurring my words today

190
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:17,939

 

191
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:25,619

so what we are going to do that's kind

192
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:25,629
so what we are going to do that's kind
 

193
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,389
so what we are going to do that's kind
of late the base here to make things

194
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:27,399
of late the base here to make things
 

195
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:47,749
of late the base here to make things
faster this is an item collection area

196
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759

 

197
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,019

okay so I have a mob Junction here I've

198
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:52,029
okay so I have a mob Junction here I've
 

199
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,879
okay so I have a mob Junction here I've
hooked a lever up to this corner block

200
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:53,889
hooked a lever up to this corner block
 

201
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,419
hooked a lever up to this corner block
so that when you flick it it switches

202
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:57,429
so that when you flick it it switches
 

203
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,629
so that when you flick it it switches
both doors at once because one of the

204
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
both doors at once because one of the
 

205
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,849
both doors at once because one of the
doors is reversed from the other so we

206
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:08,859
doors is reversed from the other so we
 

207
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:13,139
doors is reversed from the other so we
have a junction there and there goes our

208
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:13,149
have a junction there and there goes our
 

209
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,489
have a junction there and there goes our
timer and there's going to be another

210
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:17,499
timer and there's going to be another
 

211
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,569
timer and there's going to be another
Junction here and through this path it's

212
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:21,579
Junction here and through this path it's
 

213
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,899
Junction here and through this path it's
going to send we're most concerned about

214
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:24,909
going to send we're most concerned about
 

215
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,779
going to send we're most concerned about
we mostly want creepers to come through

216
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:27,789
we mostly want creepers to come through
 

217
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:35,720
we mostly want creepers to come through
here

218
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:35,730

 

219
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,450

down this path here and through this

220
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,460
down this path here and through this
 

221
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,620
down this path here and through this
path where you're going to try get

222
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:40,630
path where you're going to try get
 

223
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:56,520
path where you're going to try get
skeletons okay so we have a five by five

224
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,530
skeletons okay so we have a five by five
 

225
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:04,710
skeletons okay so we have a five by five
area here I probably won't be able to

226
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
area here I probably won't be able to
 

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,540
area here I probably won't be able to
finish this this episode but hopefully

228
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,550
finish this this episode but hopefully
 

229
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:26,460
finish this this episode but hopefully
I'll get most of it done sometimes it

230
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,470
I'll get most of it done sometimes it
 

231
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,620
I'll get most of it done sometimes it
does that if a big jumps on the pressure

232
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,630
does that if a big jumps on the pressure
 

233
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,790
does that if a big jumps on the pressure
plate won't be an issue once I get

234
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
plate won't be an issue once I get
 

235
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:46,590
plate won't be an issue once I get
everything closed off

236
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:46,600

 

237
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,140

okay so we got four water sources in

238
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,150
okay so we got four water sources in
 

239
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,360
okay so we got four water sources in
every corner which is going to bring the

240
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,370
every corner which is going to bring the
 

241
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,820
every corner which is going to bring the
mops to the center okay this is where

242
00:09:59,820 --> 00:09:59,830
mops to the center okay this is where
 

243
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,360
mops to the center okay this is where
the creepers are going to be then two

244
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,370
the creepers are going to be then two
 

245
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,200
the creepers are going to be then two
blocks away this is where the skeletons

246
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,210
blocks away this is where the skeletons
 

247
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:14,430
blocks away this is where the skeletons
are going to be and in between this is

248
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:14,440
are going to be and in between this is
 

249
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,230
are going to be and in between this is
where I'm going to be so Skelton will be

250
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
where I'm going to be so Skelton will be
 

251
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,570
where I'm going to be so Skelton will be
there he'll try shoot at me and he'll

252
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:18,580
there he'll try shoot at me and he'll
 

253
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:26,940
there he'll try shoot at me and he'll
hit the creeper and creepers will die

254
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:26,950
hit the creeper and creepers will die
 

255
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,580
hit the creeper and creepers will die
and drop records which will get fall

256
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,590
and drop records which will get fall
 

257
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,560
and drop records which will get fall
into this hole in the middle and get

258
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,570
into this hole in the middle and get
 

259
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,020
into this hole in the middle and get
sent out hopefully

260
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,030

 

261
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,550

but since the mobs aren't sorted there's

262
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
but since the mobs aren't sorted there's
 

263
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,950
but since the mobs aren't sorted there's
also going to be zombies in here which

264
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:40,960
also going to be zombies in here which
 

265
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,780
also going to be zombies in here which
is not an issue I'm mostly concerned

266
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:42,790
is not an issue I'm mostly concerned
 

267
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,780
is not an issue I'm mostly concerned
about having other skeletons in here

268
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:45,790
about having other skeletons in here
 

269
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,780
about having other skeletons in here
because skeletons over here are going to

270
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,790
because skeletons over here are going to
 

271
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,760
because skeletons over here are going to
get into fights with the skeletons in

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:53,770
get into fights with the skeletons in
 

273
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,280
get into fights with the skeletons in
the middle and skeletons in the middle

274
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,290
the middle and skeletons in the middle
 

275
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,140
the middle and skeletons in the middle
in the middle might also shoot creepers

276
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,150
in the middle might also shoot creepers
 

277
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,150
in the middle might also shoot creepers
by accident which will cause the

278
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,160
by accident which will cause the
 

279
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:11,190
by accident which will cause the
creepers to explode so might be a few

280
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
creepers to explode so might be a few
 

281
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,370
creepers to explode so might be a few
issues

282
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:17,380

 

283
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:42,940

okay

284
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:42,950

 

285
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,350

I've never made a junction quite like

286
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
I've never made a junction quite like
 

287
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:59,210
I've never made a junction quite like
this one in my and all my other mob

288
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,220
this one in my and all my other mob
 

289
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,920
this one in my and all my other mob
junctions the mobs come up from

290
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:00,930
junctions the mobs come up from
 

291
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,420
junctions the mobs come up from
underneath this one they're coming in

292
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,430
underneath this one they're coming in
 

293
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,949
underneath this one they're coming in
from the side so be a little bit more

294
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
from the side so be a little bit more
 

295
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:21,680
from the side so be a little bit more
tricky to make I'm also running very

296
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:21,690
tricky to make I'm also running very
 

297
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,400
tricky to make I'm also running very
little on glass so one of these episodes

298
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,410
little on glass so one of these episodes
 

299
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,069
little on glass so one of these episodes
we're going to have to go look for a

300
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
we're going to have to go look for a
 

301
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:41,019
we're going to have to go look for a
desert somewhere so we also need cactus

302
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:41,029

 

303
00:12:41,029 --> 00:13:07,730

Jay please sign there

304
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:07,740

 

305
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,630

I'm going to build some of this off

306
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm going to build some of this off
 

307
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,890
I'm going to build some of this off
camera because this is going to get

308
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:10,900
camera because this is going to get
 

309
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,770
camera because this is going to get
tricky then I'll show you after so I'll

310
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:13,780
tricky then I'll show you after so I'll
 

311
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,440
tricky then I'll show you after so I'll
be back in a sec okay you guys knit this

312
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,450
be back in a sec okay you guys knit this
 

313
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,770
be back in a sec okay you guys knit this
much I think I figured out a way of

314
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:22,780
much I think I figured out a way of
 

315
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,960
much I think I figured out a way of
doing it so I got a sign here and a sign

316
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:27,970
doing it so I got a sign here and a sign
 

317
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:36,360
doing it so I got a sign here and a sign
here and I'm going to put a sign here so

318
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,370
here and I'm going to put a sign here so
 

319
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,640
here and I'm going to put a sign here so
the issue is we have to make that

320
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:38,650
the issue is we have to make that
 

321
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:48,350
the issue is we have to make that
diagnosed stream of water

322
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360

 

323
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,960

it's best if it's the same if it if it's

324
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:52,970
it's best if it's the same if it if it's
 

325
00:13:52,970 --> 00:14:01,460
it's best if it's the same if it if it's
at this window part of the door so we're

326
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,470
at this window part of the door so we're
 

327
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:13,220
at this window part of the door so we're
going to make a hole here we're going to

328
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,230
going to make a hole here we're going to
 

329
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,129
going to make a hole here we're going to
put water in there to water there and I

330
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:19,139
put water in there to water there and I
 

331
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,090
put water in there to water there and I
think we have a dial screen now that

332
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,100
think we have a dial screen now that
 

333
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:40,549
think we have a dial screen now that
points towards the doors okay good then

334
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:40,559
points towards the doors okay good then
 

335
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,710
points towards the doors okay good then
put some ladders just for now and maybe

336
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:45,720
put some ladders just for now and maybe
 

337
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,989
put some ladders just for now and maybe
some torches around

338
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:51,999

 

339
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:55,840

okay so then whoops the other thing I

340
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:55,850
okay so then whoops the other thing I
 

341
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:10,829
okay so then whoops the other thing I
did get some more water

342
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839

 

343
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,299

the mobs come into the junction like

344
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:13,309
the mobs come into the junction like
 

345
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,470
the mobs come into the junction like
this and most of them are going to go

346
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,480
this and most of them are going to go
 

347
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,489
this and most of them are going to go
this way we got our diagonal screen and

348
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:23,499
this way we got our diagonal screen and
 

349
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:29,079
this way we got our diagonal screen and
there's a sign above then there's the

350
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:29,089
there's a sign above then there's the
 

351
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,989
there's a sign above then there's the
door and there's a sign and a pressure

352
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:31,999
door and there's a sign and a pressure
 

353
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:37,329
door and there's a sign and a pressure
plate and I got a sign on a sign here so

354
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:37,339
plate and I got a sign on a sign here so
 

355
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:45,400
plate and I got a sign on a sign here so
if we place water here there's no the

356
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,410
if we place water here there's no the
 

357
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,220
if we place water here there's no the
apps for the mobs get stuck in and I'm

358
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,230
apps for the mobs get stuck in and I'm
 

359
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,499
apps for the mobs get stuck in and I'm
going to test it out like I'm oh oh wait

360
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:53,509
going to test it out like I'm oh oh wait
 

361
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:00,579
going to test it out like I'm oh oh wait
no I can't test it out like I'm a mob so

362
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:00,589
no I can't test it out like I'm a mob so
 

363
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,530
no I can't test it out like I'm a mob so
a mob will come to this point then

364
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:02,540
a mob will come to this point then
 

365
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,000
a mob will come to this point then
they'll jump

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,010

 

367
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:17,740

oh no I should stork jump without

368
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:17,750
oh no I should stork jump without
 

369
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,210
oh no I should stork jump without
touching the arrow jeez this is what

370
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,220
touching the arrow jeez this is what
 

371
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,449
touching the arrow jeez this is what
happens to me I get sent to this point

372
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:24,459
happens to me I get sent to this point
 

373
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:32,590
happens to me I get sent to this point
which is what we want okay so we can

374
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
which is what we want okay so we can
 

375
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,639
which is what we want okay so we can
cover this up the mobs are in water so

376
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:36,649
cover this up the mobs are in water so
 

377
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:37,960
cover this up the mobs are in water so
they're not going to get burnt by the

378
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:37,970
they're not going to get burnt by the
 

379
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,829
they're not going to get burnt by the
Sun and there's also going to be a third

380
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:44,839
Sun and there's also going to be a third
 

381
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:55,360
Sun and there's also going to be a third
story eventually probably okay so we

382
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,370
story eventually probably okay so we
 

383
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,730
story eventually probably okay so we
need a water stream that comes up to

384
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:57,740
need a water stream that comes up to
 

385
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:13,600
need a water stream that comes up to
this point I might make a gap game I put

386
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:13,610
this point I might make a gap game I put
 

387
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:26,530
this point I might make a gap game I put
the water here plate there we want the

388
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:26,540
the water here plate there we want the
 

389
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:35,500
the water here plate there we want the
water above the door

390
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,510

 

391
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,700

I'm going to make a few more signs here

392
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:37,710
I'm going to make a few more signs here
 

393
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:51,289
I'm going to make a few more signs here
I think I got to be careful not to go

394
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:51,299
I think I got to be careful not to go
 

395
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,820
I think I got to be careful not to go
over about 20 minutes in my videos now

396
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:55,830
over about 20 minutes in my videos now
 

397
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,090
over about 20 minutes in my videos now
because it says causing any issues with

398
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,100
because it says causing any issues with
 

399
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,269
because it says causing any issues with
uploading them because I have to use the

400
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:02,279
uploading them because I have to use the
 

401
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,810
uploading them because I have to use the
advanced the low uploader if my videos

402
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,820
advanced the low uploader if my videos
 

403
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,380
advanced the low uploader if my videos
are over 2 gigs which is what seems to

404
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,390
are over 2 gigs which is what seems to
 

405
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:18,560
are over 2 gigs which is what seems to
always fail

406
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:18,570

 

407
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,710

well that's a door

408
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
well that's a door
 

409
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,310
well that's a door
okay then we place water here

410
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,320
okay then we place water here
 

411
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,070
okay then we place water here
and fills up two blocks and lastly we're

412
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
and fills up two blocks and lastly we're
 

413
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,540
and fills up two blocks and lastly we're
going to put block underneath actually

414
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:39,550
going to put block underneath actually
 

415
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:54,590
going to put block underneath actually
we might put another side they're

416
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:54,600

 

417
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:19,789

running very low on time now

418
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:19,799

up and not press any arrow keys water

426
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:36,669
up and not press any arrow keys water
 

427
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,310
up and not press any arrow keys water
takes me right through here when I get

428
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,320
takes me right through here when I get
 

429
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,680
takes me right through here when I get
to this point I'm going to jump and it

430
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:46,690
to this point I'm going to jump and it
 

431
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,749
to this point I'm going to jump and it
works awesome so I'm going to seal this

432
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:48,759
works awesome so I'm going to seal this
 

433
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,649
works awesome so I'm going to seal this
up and then I'll show some mobs going

434
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:52,659
up and then I'll show some mobs going
 

435
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:59,399
up and then I'll show some mobs going
through here okay we're ready for our

436
00:19:59,399 --> 00:19:59,409
through here okay we're ready for our
 

437
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:05,879
through here okay we're ready for our
first test run of this new system didn't

438
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:05,889
first test run of this new system didn't
 

439
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,079
first test run of this new system didn't
take long to build at all

440
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:07,089
take long to build at all
 

441
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:12,719
take long to build at all
I added a so it's all closed up now it's

442
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:12,729
I added a so it's all closed up now it's
 

443
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,169
I added a so it's all closed up now it's
two blocks high so they can't jump which

444
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:16,179
two blocks high so they can't jump which
 

445
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,379
two blocks high so they can't jump which
gets them through a lot faster I added

446
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:19,389
gets them through a lot faster I added
 

447
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:23,099
gets them through a lot faster I added
this side entrance here in case I need

448
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:23,109
this side entrance here in case I need
 

449
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,289
this side entrance here in case I need
to do maintenance and there's nothing to

450
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:28,299
to do maintenance and there's nothing to
 

451
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,419
to do maintenance and there's nothing to
hold them so I'm going to be switching

452
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:30,429
hold them so I'm going to be switching
 

453
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:38,580
hold them so I'm going to be switching
to peaceful very quickly

456
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,130
looks perfect even if a creeper blows up
 

457
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,160
looks perfect even if a creeper blows up

458
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,170
there shouldn't cause any damage because
 

459
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:04,330
there shouldn't cause any damage because
