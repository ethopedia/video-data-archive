1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,050
Aoh, oh, no new enterporter for this episode,
everybody. Oh, I broke the streak already. We

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,940
were doin so good we discot the the one we did last
episode. Aha, yes, I've been building the

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,920
enterporters mostly off camera, but I thought
to day, let's try build one together a bit here.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,020
Ah cause we gotta design a new one so I ought to put
an interporter of a stupid enterman. I ought to

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,980
put an interporter in the mantaviere, I'm
trying to decide where to put it and ideally I

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,930
want it over here, though like this is the area we
we spend the most time in in the world. I think how

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,080
could it be if we had an anterporter like Raiden
here? Well, we can't really do that because

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,170
underneath the smelting room there we have the
tomagotci pet. We got the creeper face with the

9
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,750
portal behind and there's a bunch of red stone
behind this, there's not enough space to do it.

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,090
Really, unless we do something kind of special
with this one Bcause. there's no room below

11
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,990
this. There's no room besides this. That just
leaves above. Now. the question is what is above

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,090
this melting room. You might wonder. well, um,
fun, little fact, I think this is my first

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,620
cracking table furnace and wooden pick we made
in the series. Here, we still got it in the exact

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,470
same place we left it, so I don't really want to
move. That tit's kindo like an hostalgic thing

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,750
for me. But then Ah, we got this water pool we got
deal with. We gotta fill this in so it doesn't

16
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,980
leak. And then I think if we dig down around here
somewhere they'll take us right to the smelting

17
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,120
room. I'm goinna guess maybe around here. let's
find out. Nope, that's amiss. Oit's. moreover,

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,910
here. Yeah, at's one of our shockers, okay,
Good, Yeah, so we have some space above the

19
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,940
smelting room that we can take advantage of, but
the thing is, interporters are loaded by

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,950
throwing the pearl down, usually into the
bubble Com. So that that's our challenge. Weget

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,480
a design an interporter wher wethrow, the
interproll up. And yeah, that's a little bit

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,450
tricky because we want the enter pearl to sit in a
bubble column in order to make a bubble cull, you

23
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,150
need a piece of sold Sam below, so we can't just go
underneath that and throw it in ecause. Then we

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,080
hit the soul sand right, so we either got to move
the sole sand out of our way as we throw the inter

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,100
pearl and then put it back or we need to push the
interparal into the bubble stream somehow, and

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,970
I think we're going to go for the second option,
pushing the inter pearl into the bubble stream

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,380
will probably be a little bit easier, but either
method we choose here, We gottor somehow detect

28
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,460
to when we throw the endor pearl, and
unfortunately I think trep wires are really the

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,000
only way of doing that. Um, The problem with the
trippires though is, Uh, they don't always

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,480
detect like stuff passing through hem, like, if
you throw it here, those lights then turned on.

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,000
it passed right through he the trip wire but if
you get the distance just right, Oh, that's one

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,480
that works. Ok. Wol. If we go up a block, Um, then
it'll It'll detect it that time it passed

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,500
through. I guess at this height might be what we
end up doing then, not really sure how much water

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,170
we need here. so let's jus fill this all the way
up, and then we'll figure it out from there so

35
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,060
that will be solid water above the sole sand, and
then we'll have one water source at the very top,

36
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,290
so hopefully this will be downward flowing
water for we're at, and that'll sow down the

37
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,650
intercrowl a little bit quicker. Let's see if we
gat the roof here. Oh no, we don't okkay. good,

38
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,510
cool cool. So that slows it down really good. and
then we just have to push it into the bubble

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,380
column. Oky, Well, I took me a little bit of trowl
in air here to get the distances and the timings.

40
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,900
all correct with this, but I think it's pretty
consistent now. so he put a piston at the top of

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,840
the water, so that the interprols moving the
slowest at the top of the inter pearl arc. We push

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,740
it to the left into the bubble column. That way,
it's a consistent. and Ah, it seems to work like

43
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,360
every time, which is great. So then it says,
Suspended at the top of that and we just got to

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,140
activate a piston to the push it back to the right
out of the bubble, calm and it'll fall back down.

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,290
so just for now, I tot is for this piston pushes it
over and it should land right back into our

46
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:23,050
smelting room, which, which is great, So yeah,
the timing is four Redston ticks here. so he

47
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,640
said, a little ladder from the trip wire, and the
again, the spacing on all this matters a lot. So

48
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,520
we go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight blocks to this wole sand, and then we have

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,910
six water blucks above that and that pistons at
the fifth one, we've got to have another water

50
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,590
buck above it. Otherwise the water will have a
horizontal momentum to it and push the

51
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,270
interpearl into the wall. Oh, Snapper's all
right, everbody, so after a bit o time here, we

52
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,180
got it installed in the ceiling like we wanted
to, so we readed the roof in the smelting room, Um

53
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,990
just put some blast furnaces in here for a bit of
variation. It looks maybe a bit weird. Still. I

54
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,560
may make some more adjustments. You know what I
forgot is H. This room's actually on slabs, so

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,780
that really affected the interpearls passing
through the tripwires. I had to change at

56
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,700
distance, so we have. I think four and a half
blocks of space before the trip fire. Ah, but it

57
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,110
works like every time, which is which is
awesome, so we throw it up. It gets set in place.

58
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,700
We have a button here, the teleport to our next
station and throw down. We can tell port back. It

59
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,280
does take a little bit longer, because this is a
special one. We make it fall through the water

60
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,340
instead of activating instantly. So it's a
little bit lower than our other interporters,

61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,570
and the really cool thing about this is now that
we've added that station in the mancave, we have

62
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,840
a complete line that passes through. like all
our important builds, From the mancave to our

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,770
strong hold base. we can go right to our end
portal that we'll want to make some more branch

64
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,000
hops to other things like our coarsefruit farm,
probably to the libraries to other places like

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,860
that, but uh, the main area is covered now, and
uh, In order to mate this better, I standardized

66
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,970
all our interporter station Celets, other
thing I've been working on here, so we'll

67
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,600
probably have like four buttons along a wall.
This wild get filled up with interprols, so we

68
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,510
get one every time we tell Te ports. and then
there'll probably be some signs tat they wer

69
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:27,780
Thes lead to sort a thing, pretty simple design.
I know some people mention I can use things like

70
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,700
item frames, and Likhe choose a station that
way, but we really want this to be quick and

71
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,910
simple. Um, and buttons are probably the best
way of doing that or pressure plates, but I'm

72
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,870
worried slimes will spawn and step on our
pressure plates when we don't want them to, So

73
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,420
that's why I went for the buttons. The other
thing is, I had trouble triggering the trap

74
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,410
door. finding a good method for that, so we were
doing something like this before where we had

75
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,360
pass it through an observer, then it W'll go to
the trap door sort of thing, and it does that

76
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,280
quick flip like we want it to, But the problem is
it does it on both the powering and unpowering,

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,100
so I came up with something pretty cool Here. We
got like a sticky pist, thin, Um, just a really

78
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,080
simple thing, but it only activates when we want
it to, so not on the powering, only on the

79
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,890
uncowering, and it still does the quick, flip,
like we need. That's perfect. That's what we got

80
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,900
at all our stations Now awesome. So it that the
only thing let to show you really is just how cool

81
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,890
this actually is. So we. we'll take a trip from
the mancae to our stronghold face and checked

82
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:40,190
Thi outers so awesome and look at this, sir,
we're at are and portal. Just like that. we

83
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,880
wantta go back. Oh band super quick. I heard a
indermight. I wonder if antermi, tere goinnt be

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,120
an issue Wit this. Actually, I didn't think
about that too much and we're over at Santy City

85
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,130
and this one again. This is the slowest one. but
it's not too bad, right, amazing, so we

86
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,460
travelled like fifteen hundred blocks. E. Yep,
yep, so I'm gonna be adding more on to that. An

87
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,560
future episodes ins is going to keep getting
better and better when it's alreadyi supr,

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,760
awesome, so I I'm really happy, with how that
turned out actually over at the Guardian farm.

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,790
Remember last episode we started a gelt farm.
This is mostly just the fill up the space we had

90
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,660
here. but saih, you know, I didn't have a kelt
firm in my world, so it's kind of nice. We'll be

91
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,650
able to get this Li bit easier now. and uh, I
actually kind o like building with killbox.

92
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,210
Surprisingly, they're They're a bit tricky to
use. but if you can use. them, in some situations

93
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,630
it's the only way to get that dark green colour.
Ah, and these are pretty much fully done. I would

94
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:48,470
say we got a pretty satisfying way of harvesting
them too. Is it? The button here goes all along

95
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,400
like that? Then you see the celt float up to the
top and then at the very top it like fundles over

96
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,610
the wall and ends up over here. I didn't do a
collection system for this because I don't know

97
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,360
what we're putting here. Am figured we'd
somehow tie it in. so just for now all the kelp

98
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,450
ends up on the ground here. Al just pick it up in
chalters. Probably um, and yeh, then it's free

99
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,820
to regrow And you see, I added some sea lanterns
in the back there as well, and we did another one

100
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,130
on that side. This was an actually a huge
project. This wis a bit. these are big walls.

101
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:30,490
We're dealin with yer, and let's do this one more
time, cause it's so awesome. I love it. The way

102
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,160
that works is we just have a chain of observers
that run over top of sticky pistons and you's got

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,250
to update one of the ends here. It goes all the way
down, su per simple, and I should probably show

104
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,510
you the collection system as well, just in case
you're curious. It is not fancy at all, though,

105
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:55,990
Ah, basically the telt grows over here and then
we have water source blocks at my head level here

106
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,640
and then there's no water source above the
netherwork and then trap doors stop the water,

107
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,660
and then we have one watersource block ere and it
is a big staircase that goes all the way down and

108
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,120
all the kelp lands in this and funnels to one
spot. Ah, just hate it, curiosity. I wan't try

109
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,480
something here. I'd never use horses any more,
but during the world tour we found out that. Ah,

110
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,900
this migh not be broken. Now, look at that All
right. We can get horses out of the mancube

111
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:33,550
again. That's pretty cool. I get some firework
rockets and this guy is not as fast as I was

112
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:44,190
hoping. waitit. Alway's got the g. That's one of
my villages. Why are you on the surface Et in the

113
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:57,750
water, Buddy. Ah, he's dead. He had the. he had,
the. Uh, my horse frinly, the diamond ping ono on

114
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,640
his clothes. So he had to harvest some sugar cane
here, and I was hoping the horse would make it

115
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,330
easier, but he makes it hofper actually alight.
So it turns out horses do not like lilipads. We

116
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,190
just figured something out. We didn't know a
kind of Ah. That's something weird to them.

117
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,580
Well, that was fun, but I kina remember why I
don't use horses, so let's let's return em and

118
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,600
see if this still works that Ye didn't take
damage awesome, Ok, cool. go back to our horse

119
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,840
table. Oh, they're They're kind of weird
onstairs to, aren't they? Now? look atet hu.

120
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,640
aha, yeah. so empthing oult is Mob System is one
of my regular jobs. I tsouwh was overflowin on

121
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,260
gunpowder, so gotta take care of that. A zombie
flesh gets treated to cheef. How, and the bones

122
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,520
always go into the bambooslurifto. keep that
fueled. And then we got the arrows, which go to

123
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,570
our courstrer farm and the gunpotder gets
converted into rockets and t nd t constantly, So

124
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,360
it's been a little bit time since my last episode
of this. It's not because I've been lazy. Not not

125
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,500
quite. I did the start playing mine craft
dungeons, and been playing among us in some

126
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,240
other games, so I've been taking it a little bit
easy, but I've also been doing a massive grind

127
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,900
project since last episode, so we started this
wither skelton firm. Last time we did the one

128
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,450
layer. I have since installed another two
layers. We got the upper and lower with the

129
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,530
piglins in the middle. so I had to farm up more
wiahther roses to get that finished up. And the

130
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:30,810
big thing though was finishing a slabbing the
area. It's not totally done. There's still some

131
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,990
caves I haven't found yet, but uh yeah, it's like
all done now. Pretty much. Ah, just went adown, I

132
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,230
did the perimeter and then Ah, I was like Okay,
Why is this still not working too good? Ight, I

133
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:50,920
still warn't getting to me with ther skeltons,
And then I found an area over our hair kindo

134
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,850
hidden away up and behind. I had to slab all this
section here too, everything above. Um, if you

135
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,790
have a big flat spot, it's a lot easier just to
span Lavan in it. That'sh I did for a big portion

136
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:13,190
of this, but yeah, I. think, I got most pol ey. I
think I be careful though, in case you forget

137
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:21,140
about it like where you put it, Alf. Yeah, we get
some up here to who Ows a cos cott Aha. Yeah, so

138
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,380
ethobe Slabbin got a lot of it done, But that's
not all. We also need a place to kill the guys and

139
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,570
to gather them and all that stuff right, So
started setting up something here as well is

140
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,330
walk up to Im. Hit him with the sword, nice and
simple. a, I didn't do the dog thing, though, as

141
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:45,610
its kindo lazy to do that, but every so often this
pushes hm. yether it took up to oclock, and then

142
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:52,410
we got a drop or ele it Woe laughed down there we
got drop her elevator to bring the drops up to

143
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,740
Esorting system. We got bones, three things for
bones, one for coal, and then the withere

144
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:06,460
skeltonheads, it gathered there, and uh, you
see, the rates aren't perfect, the definitely

145
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:12,350
not too bad right, but the rates will get a lot
better as well if I can find a few more of the

146
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,220
caves. I know there's a bunch hidden in the lava
and up in the ceiling that I need to slab over. And

147
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:24,030
then the rates will get even better, but ah, yea,
they're not bad. So the the cool thing about

148
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,240
this, Of course, we got unlimited beacons
Basically now we got fuel for smelting, but we

149
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,340
mainly want the farm for the bones whither
skeldind farms produce an insane amount of

150
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,230
bones, and I feel like bones and gunpowder are
your two base ingredients in the scheme

151
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,590
performing all the other things, So I wanted a
good source of ones in my world Here and now we

152
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,720
finally have it. There's one more kind of cool
thing about this, though, as well up above the

153
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:59,540
Witherskelton farm is the Goon farm and that guy
over there. Ah, so yeah, we got our besalt

154
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,310
farming thing here. Um, Ana bunch is stop right,
So that the thing is when we use our wither

155
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,180
scelton farm. We also collect iron
automatically from Lhe goon farm. Oatsolful.

156
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:20,990
Wow, Oh, it's overflowing. Uhoh. Okaysa, good
to know, so we cin get iron as we get to bones and

157
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:27,520
stuff as well. All right, so we're goin t take a
moment now to stop by the crimson. Keep. what do

158
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,730
you guys think about this project, by the way, D
you still like it, but you want to see more of it or

159
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,970
you'e kind of bord of it. Um, as much as I like this
nether update. I do worry that it's not really

160
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,680
that fun watching stuff done in the neather.
Still, I don't know. Itis is a just kind of a

161
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:49,030
feeling I have. but Ah, I do have more ideas with
this if we want O work on it. Saim more. The thing

162
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,200
we're going to do here, though, is that finish up
the Magma cube farm, we didn't have enough with E

163
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,910
roses for it, and I farmed a few extra so that we
could fill in all these missing faces. Ah, this

164
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,890
is the worst part about with the roses. You can
never tell if you miss the spot because theyre

165
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:11,670
all like in different positions. I think we got
em all now. Oh, it is a thunder storm. yea, Okay,

166
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:18,420
this it. this is your chance. 've been trying to
do this for weeks, you get the stupid mushroom up

167
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:26,290
here. Let's see if hopefully this doesn't kill
him. Dhon't want O hit you hard. but it's not

168
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:34,940
thrown in the sike. I don. If wer really quick, we
might be able to make it think it's over here.

169
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:45,360
Han, We got a mooshroom There, Go through the
Pordal. Oh, it spawns us under camps. No, Yes, we

170
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:59,790
dinit ground mushrooms and cortullya, but if we
need em, we go mo so in terms of like farming

171
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,859
resources, and stuff, the main thing we need in
our world. Like more than anything is

172
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,839
villagers. We have this underground village.
It's graid and all. I use it all the time. but the

173
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,450
villagers do die here. Unfortunately, it's not
like a foolproof thing, so we need to get

174
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:26,619
something a bit better. Um, Ooh, I got a
breakfast, don't i yo ogto break it and he still

175
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,040
stuck. Get out O there. Okay Dariol. Oh, he
finally got his trao stock to kill, put that back

176
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,390
and I didn't get the divilent sine Okay, we're
goin to go to the nether. So the planis. we're

177
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,450
going to make some kind of villaer breeder in our
netherhub, so that when we need these guys

178
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:51,360
anywhere in our world, Ih, we'll be able to get
them and transport them through another. Not

179
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,170
that one you won't go through in the mancat,
right, so I got knock yo out of that. You won't go

180
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:04,540
through, out of a mind hirds, Okay, that's not
Ea. You can go through. Go ahead. The more the

181
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:12,310
marrier. nobody wants to go through my portals.
This is isn't e word denote Okay. It looks like I

182
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,850
can't send items through either, which is
interesting. So think as the chunks aren't

183
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:25,360
loaded here or the portals not conneced
properly. Oh, it connected over hers. It is not

184
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:34,080
the right place. I mean it is the right place, but
it's not the place. it normar ten and now Ay now

185
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,040
that I actually made a portal they'll go through
Be good or you regot one guy. So if you're

186
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,440
training a villagers, throug raport. I'll
probably the easiest thing to do is just to do

187
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,490
this around it. That way they will stay near the
portal and not run away. They won't run across

188
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,100
tracks. O. that works really good. We just try
get em there. We go. O. k. now, I' got to figure,

189
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,470
out how to get them where I want them. Oh man.
okay, so this actually worked out really good.

190
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,630
Were really close to where I wanted them to go.
Actually, I just dug out a little thing Her.

191
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:13,450
We're going to push em up. push them up. E. All
right, made it to go round the corner. and this is

192
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:22,510
exactly where I want them to go Stup here. And now
we are above our netherhubb. is the netherhub

193
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,440
over here, so we're going to make like a an area
here for breeding villagers, and then we can

194
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,150
drop them down. Yea so ol of our tunnels have
tracks, so we can just drop em down in a mine card

195
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,970
on a track. They won't take all damage. Or maybe
we'll use a boat or something and we'll be able to

196
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,790
asend them anywhere we want them to go in our
world, Allright. Then the plan is to pig out a bit

197
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,190
of an area here and it can take a bit of time. to,
get these guys breeding, so let's get that

198
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,640
started right away. I got to be so careful with
this. I have definitely accidentally Rand lick

199
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,440
beds before in Anether, and is the worst thing.
Ah, oky, so I'll have to set up a bunch of beds, a

200
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,230
bunch of work stations. I guess let's mus put the
lectrons in front of the beds for now. It's night

201
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,200
time All right, So they shore to count Den is
sleeping Now it's great. they'll be able to

202
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,460
breed in the morning. I got get the some food for
these guys, though I'm out O here. This isn't

203
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,640
exactly the best place for the Sgab. but I've got
our farmer guy over here for right now, Om, an

204
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,520
just one to make sure he doesn't escape or get
killed, So we're going to buy a bunch of bread op

205
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:38,480
of him to feed to our new cillagers. Here you go.
Don't that sound like a baby? We got a baby, Ha,

206
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,550
right so it's workin, but anyways,
unfortunately, that's probably as far as wi'll

207
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,770
get on that project today, because I am all at a
time. I have actually spent way too long on this

208
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,730
episode. Lots of grindy stuff on this this
episode. Ah, but yeah, our infastructure in the

209
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,550
worldis getting much better, which is great,
but let's get to the comment of the day it says, Do

210
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,960
you ever go back and rewatch any of your videos
like, the speed challenges, for example, do you

211
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,920
think you would be amused as to how your thought
process was for certain things? Now being years

212
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,790
more experienced, I am sure your viewers would
love to see an up to detd speed challenge of some

213
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:21,580
kind, reviving the old days. Aha, yes, O,
typically like I don't rewatch my videos

214
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,170
sometimes, Il, I'll see some stuff, Um, A,
mainly like the videos I find more interesting

215
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:36,090
to rewatch are like the Team Canada stuff, cause
eh, younoeg me interacting with other people

216
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,590
and I find it interesting. I all. I'll be
rewatching it. My memory is not quite perfect. I

217
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,630
remember most stuff, but they'll be like. Okay.
what am I going to say next? in this situation

218
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,270
I'll compare, like what I would say nowadays,
tho what I'll actually see in the video and a lot

219
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:56,230
of times it cattes me off cars like oh was not
expecting that or sometimes they'll be like.

220
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,350
Oh, Hit was a little bit snarki. You know,
Isabet. I was a bit immature back then. you know,

221
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,300
probably wouldn't have responded like that
Nowadays. that's kind of fun to see that, but uh,

222
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,740
generally I don't really watch my videos. As far
as speech hallenges go. That's like an old

223
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,710
series I had where I would try do a certain task in
the game as quick as possible, like a start from

224
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,330
scratch and go to the nether kill aghast as quick
as possible or early. I think one of my better

225
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,500
challenges is I tried to brew all the potions in
the game as quick as possible. I godlike really

226
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,020
likey o. Matt. Run an it in like thirty five
minutes or something. I remember. I was pretty

227
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,170
proud of that one. Um, but I haven't touched the
series like since then, Ah, speed speedriting

228
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,150
an mind crafters become more popular. Those who
maybe it's worth the thinking about T again, or

229
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,800
like, even hardcore mine craft people are more
interested in now, So it could be fun. I have been

230
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,280
wanting. That may be start from scratch in the
nether. That something haven't tried yet since

231
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,630
it's been possible. Ah, and that might be fun.
but uh, yeah, nothing definite anyways.

232
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,680
hopeully, I's enjoyed to day's ef fiso. thank
you for watch an I help you, Ave a wonderful day.

233
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,140
Take here byebye
