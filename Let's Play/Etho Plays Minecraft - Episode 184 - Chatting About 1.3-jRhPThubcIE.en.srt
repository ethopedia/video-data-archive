226
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:51,830
doesn't seem like that would be enough
 

227
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,589
doesn't seem like that would be enough
time to set that you don't a mob I guess

228
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599

we could try it on ourselves maybe no

230
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
we could try it on ourselves maybe no
 

231

it's pretty hard to stay in there oh you
know what we can do see when they make

234
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,289
know what we can do see when they make
 

235
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:14,370
know what we can do see when they make
that noise it sounds like they're dying

236
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,380

 

237
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:22,640

I see how how much just takes off of us

238
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:22,650

 

239
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,960

yeah that's not it close to enough time

240
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:24,970
yeah that's not it close to enough time
 

241
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,390
yeah that's not it close to enough time
so therefore they're fine with that I'm

242
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
so therefore they're fine with that I'm
 

243
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,510
so therefore they're fine with that I'm
pretty sure the other day when I was

244
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
pretty sure the other day when I was
 

245
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,030
pretty sure the other day when I was
shearing sheep I could have sworn I

246

shearing sheep I could have sworn I
 

247
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,370
shearing sheep I could have sworn I
double sheared them and I checked the

248
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,380
double sheared them and I checked the
 

249
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,250
double sheared them and I checked the
wiki today to see how many hearts these

250
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,260
wiki today to see how many hearts these
 

251
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,530
wiki today to see how many hearts these
guys have or to double check and they

252
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:43,540
guys have or to double check and they
 

253
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,650
guys have or to double check and they
got eight hearts but it said there's

254
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:46,660
got eight hearts but it said there's
 

255
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,600
got eight hearts but it said there's
this glitch that if they have seven and

256
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,610
this glitch that if they have seven and
 

257
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,620
this glitch that if they have seven and
a half or not not a tarts eight half

258
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,630
a half or not not a tarts eight half
 

259
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,960
a half or not not a tarts eight half
hearts so if they have three and a half

260
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:54,970
hearts so if they have three and a half
 

261
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,330
hearts so if they have three and a half
hearts so everybody if you left and

262
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,340

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,370
system down below there I thought I
 

313
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,670
system down below there I thought I
explored all the abandoned mineshaft in

314
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
explored all the abandoned mineshaft in
 

315
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
explored all the abandoned mineshaft in
this area but it seems like there's a

316
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:35,610
this area but it seems like there's a
 

317
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,020
this area but it seems like there's a
whole bunch more there than I missed

whole bunch more there than I missed
 

319

a big change recently is the XP systems

440
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:57,249
a big change recently is the XP systems
 

441
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:01,530
a big change recently is the XP systems
difference you know I'm gonna take the

442
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:01,540
difference you know I'm gonna take the
 

443
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,639
difference you know I'm gonna take the
chests instead of going up to level 50

444
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:05,649
chests instead of going up to level 50
 

445
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:06,900
chests instead of going up to level 50
as you probably know you only go up to

446
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:06,910
as you probably know you only go up to
 

447
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,119
as you probably know you only go up to
level 30 now and it's no longer like

448
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:11,129
level 30 now and it's no longer like
 

449
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,809
level 30 now and it's no longer like
what's what's the word quadric turd

450
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:14,819
what's what's the word quadric turd
 

451
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,790
what's what's the word quadric turd
where it requires more XP each level you

452
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:17,800
where it requires more XP each level you
 

453
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,859
where it requires more XP each level you
go up it's now linear so it's the same

454
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:19,869
go up it's now linear so it's the same
 

455
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:23,850
go up it's now linear so it's the same
amount XP per per level and I tried to

456
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:23,860
amount XP per per level and I tried to
 

457
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,650
amount XP per per level and I tried to
find out what that is and I think it's

458
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:25,660
find out what that is and I think it's
 

459
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,259
find out what that is and I think it's
17 per level but I could be wrong so the

460
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:31,269
17 per level but I could be wrong so the
 

461
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,710
17 per level but I could be wrong so the
new tap is at 30 and it's 17 per level

462
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
new tap is at 30 and it's 17 per level
 

463
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,919
new tap is at 30 and it's 17 per level
that works out to 510 XP get maxed out

464
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:39,929
that works out to 510 XP get maxed out
 

465
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:45,449
that works out to 510 XP get maxed out
which is about a ninth of what it was

466
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:45,459
which is about a ninth of what it was
 

467
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,829
which is about a ninth of what it was
before so big difference there and then

468
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
before so big difference there and then
 

469
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,819
before so big difference there and then
on top of it something else that's

470
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:53,829
on top of it something else that's
 

471
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,929
on top of it something else that's
different is you get xp for mining ores

472
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:57,939
different is you get xp for mining ores
 

473
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,049
different is you get xp for mining ores
and even for cooking which i think is

474
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:01,059
and even for cooking which i think is
 

475
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,460
and even for cooking which i think is
really cool I like the idea of getting

476
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,470
really cool I like the idea of getting
 

477
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,259
really cool I like the idea of getting
it for mining ores it kind of adds an

478
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:04,269
it for mining ores it kind of adds an
 

479
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,429

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,010
so this cave I'm exploring here is
 

639
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,610
so this cave I'm exploring here is
potential new building area too that's

640
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:41,620
potential new building area too that's
 

641
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,350
potential new building area too that's
another reason I want to show it to you

642
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
another reason I want to show it to you
 

643
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,409
another reason I want to show it to you

645
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:52,150
because it's my very well one day be
part of the the man cave

646
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,580

then we got the new randomly generated

652
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,590
then we got the new randomly generated
 

653
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,080
then we got the new randomly generated
structures which look awesome see what I

654
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,090
structures which look awesome see what I
 

655
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,390

to start tossing stuff there's a bunch
 

661
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,370
to start tossing stuff there's a bunch
of stuff I can toss but it's like you

662
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,380
of stuff I can toss but it's like you
 

663
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,140
of stuff I can toss but it's like you
can't hold on to anything with the

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,150
can't hold on to anything with the
 

665
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,150
can't hold on to anything with the
inventory space you have new gravel

666
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
inventory space you have new gravel
 

667
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,680
inventory space you have new gravel
texture so many things have come out

668
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:36,690
texture so many things have come out
 

669

671
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,260
I've already started like I already was
at the point where I forgot what had

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,270
at the point where I forgot what had
 

673
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,990
at the point where I forgot what had
come out and when I was trying out the

674
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,000
come out and when I was trying out the
 

675
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,880
come out and when I was trying out the
snapshot extrema and someone mentions

676
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:46,890
snapshot extrema and someone mentions
 

677
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,290
snapshot extrema and someone mentions
what do you think of the new gravel

678
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,300
what do you think of the new gravel
 

679
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,960
what do you think of the new gravel
texture and I was like new gravel

680
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:50,970
texture and I was like new gravel
 

681
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,720
texture and I was like new gravel

then I remembered seeing it like weeks
 

685
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,160
then I remembered seeing it like weeks
ago and just completely forgot about it

686

gonna say probably close close to the
 

691
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,350
gonna say probably close close to the
end of our teaming adventure here or the

692
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
end of our teaming adventure here or the
 

693

right when I stopped recording

706
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:43,560

 

707
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,960

oh yeah the mobs they switched it to
 

709
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,820

they lag in single-player now which is

712
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,120
they lag in single-player now which is
 

713
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,940
they lag in single-player now which is
the thing I like least about the patch

714
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:58,950
the thing I like least about the patch
 

715
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,840
the thing I like least about the patch
that's hopefully they improve it a

716
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:02,850
that's hopefully they improve it a
 

717
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,930
that's hopefully they improve it a
little bit the boats don't work the same

you're in the ocean and you hold the UP
button you may eventually start going in

724
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:14,940
button you may eventually start going in
 

725
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,200

circles even like instead of keep going

726
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,210

735
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,750
the half slabs it seems like wooden half
slabs burn now so there's a chance some

736
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
slabs burn now so there's a chance some
 

737
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,900
slabs burn now so there's a chance some
of the stuff in my man cave is in danger

738
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,910
of the stuff in my man cave is in danger
 

739
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,460
of the stuff in my man cave is in danger
you know I have all that lava around

740
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,470
you know I have all that lava around
 

741
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,540
you know I have all that lava around
some of that's being held in place by

742
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:47,550
some of that's being held in place by
 

743
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:55,460
some of that's being held in place by
half slabs I'm pretty sure all right

744
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,470
half slabs I'm pretty sure all right
 

745
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,960
half slabs I'm pretty sure all right
well I'm gonna continue here but I hope

746
00:21:59,960 --> 00:21:59,970
well I'm gonna continue here but I hope

you guys enjoyed this little change of
pace and we might do something more I'll

750
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,390
pace and we might do something more I'll
 

751
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:11,060
pace and we might do something more I'll
see how long this episode is well that

752
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,070
see how long this episode is well that
 

753
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,720
see how long this episode is well that
was fun

754
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:11,730
was fun
 

755
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,480
was fun
I did not go very much longer because my

756
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,490
I did not go very much longer because my
 

757
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,960
I did not go very much longer because my
my inventory filled up of course I it's

758
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:17,970
my inventory filled up of course I it's
 

759
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,800
my inventory filled up of course I it's
the coal that gets me but I just can't

760
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:21,810
the coal that gets me but I just can't
 

761
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,210
the coal that gets me but I just can't
leave it let's try out our new record I

762
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,220
leave it let's try out our new record I
 

763
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,210
leave it let's try out our new record I
know this one sounds terrible

764
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,220

 

765
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,090

add it to our collection I'm gonna head

766
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,100
add it to our collection I'm gonna head
 

767
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,440
add it to our collection I'm gonna head
back down there though probably because

768
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,450
back down there though probably because
 

769
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:43,099
back down there though probably because
I saw some redstone and stuff but we'll

770
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:43,109
I saw some redstone and stuff but we'll
 

771
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:48,109
I saw some redstone and stuff but we'll
probably wrap this episode up one thing

772
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:48,119
probably wrap this episode up one thing
 

773
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,789
probably wrap this episode up one thing
I'm going to do yet is hook up the

774
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:49,799
I'm going to do yet is hook up the
 

775
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,849
I'm going to do yet is hook up the
buttons to the sheep farm and that will

776
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:52,859
buttons to the sheep farm and that will
 

777
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,320
buttons to the sheep farm and that will
be it for the day yeah okay so let's

778
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,330
be it for the day yeah okay so let's
 

779
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,180
be it for the day yeah okay so let's
let's do this real quick we're gonna put

780
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,190
let's do this real quick we're gonna put
 

781
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,830
let's do this real quick we're gonna put
our buttons here and here I believe this

782
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
our buttons here and here I believe this
 

783
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,739
our buttons here and here I believe this
one will be for the sprinkler system and

784
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:09,749
one will be for the sprinkler system and
 

785
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:15,769
one will be for the sprinkler system and
it'll go up here and this front is not

786
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:15,779
it'll go up here and this front is not
 

787
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,139
it'll go up here and this front is not
done I'll put something to make it look

788
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:18,149
done I'll put something to make it look
 

789
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,330
done I'll put something to make it look
better and you won't be able to see that

790
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,340
better and you won't be able to see that
 

791
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,129
better and you won't be able to see that
stuff up there either when it's all done

792
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:22,139
stuff up there either when it's all done
 

793
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:24,619
stuff up there either when it's all done
but from this side I'll probably keep it

794
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:24,629
but from this side I'll probably keep it
 

795
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:33,889
but from this side I'll probably keep it
like this okay let's head up here we

796
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:33,899
like this okay let's head up here we
