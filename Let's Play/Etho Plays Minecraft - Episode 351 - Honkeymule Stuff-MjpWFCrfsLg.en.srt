actually getting a decent amount of
 

59
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,370
actually getting a decent amount of
gunpowder - oh look at this more gas and

60
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380
gunpowder - oh look at this more gas and
 

61
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,740

oh it's so crazy and that's not it of
 

65
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,830
oh it's so crazy and that's not it of
course so this injection system thing is

66
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
course so this injection system thing is
 

67
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,139
course so this injection system thing is
actually working out really well

68
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:45,149
actually working out really well
 

69
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,300

where I basically have five of each item

70
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,310
where I basically have five of each item
 

71
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,609
where I basically have five of each item
in the hopper and then when the the

72
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:49,619
in the hopper and then when the the
 

73
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,620
in the hopper and then when the the
minecart leaves the station here

74
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,630
minecart leaves the station here
 

75
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,359
minecart leaves the station here
after finishing unloading it will pick

76
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:53,369
after finishing unloading it will pick
 

77
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,389
after finishing unloading it will pick
up one of each of these and that seems

78
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
up one of each of these and that seems
 

79
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,550
up one of each of these and that seems
to keep it picking up the items I want

80
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
to keep it picking up the items I want
 

81
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,289
to keep it picking up the items I want
and ignoring like the gold sorts and

82
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:00,299
and ignoring like the gold sorts and
 

83
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,060
and ignoring like the gold sorts and
every everything else that's kind of

84
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
every everything else that's kind of
 

85
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,440
every everything else that's kind of
junk zombie flesh in there look at that

86
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
junk zombie flesh in there look at that
 

87
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,729
junk zombie flesh in there look at that
isn't that crazy we have over six stacks

88
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:10,739
isn't that crazy we have over six stacks
 

89
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,839
isn't that crazy we have over six stacks
of gas tears

90
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:11,849
of gas tears
 

91
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,390
of gas tears
from this farm oh man Oh today

92
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
from this farm oh man Oh today
 

93
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,849
from this farm oh man Oh today
donut pick up gunpowder I just not and

94
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:19,859
donut pick up gunpowder I just not and
 

95
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,309
donut pick up gunpowder I just not and
of course the main reason for the farm

96
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
of course the main reason for the farm
 

97
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,770
of course the main reason for the farm
is the gold and we have gotten over

98
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,780
is the gold and we have gotten over
 

99
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,089
is the gold and we have gotten over
three stacks of blocks of gold profit

100
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:29,099
three stacks of blocks of gold profit
 

101
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,740
three stacks of blocks of gold profit
here so we're gonna be using these on

102
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:30,750
here so we're gonna be using these on
 

103
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,699
here so we're gonna be using these on
beacons mostly that's that's basically

104
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:34,709
beacons mostly that's that's basically
 

105
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,659
beacons mostly that's that's basically
what I'm planning on using them for and

106
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:37,669
what I'm planning on using them for and
 

107
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,879
what I'm planning on using them for and
all in all it's working out good I do

108
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:40,889
all in all it's working out good I do
 

109
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,069
all in all it's working out good I do
think we need to get a second minecart

110
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:43,079
think we need to get a second minecart
 

111
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,240
think we need to get a second minecart
picking things up though it's not quite

112
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,250
picking things up though it's not quite
 

113
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,550
picking things up though it's not quite
doing its job it's I'm guessing about

114
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
doing its job it's I'm guessing about
 

115
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,909
doing its job it's I'm guessing about
1/3 to 1/4 of things Rd spawning because

116
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:52,919
1/3 to 1/4 of things Rd spawning because
 

117
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,909
1/3 to 1/4 of things Rd spawning because
it runs out of inventory space so I'll

118
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:55,919
it runs out of inventory space so I'll
 

119
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,429
it runs out of inventory space so I'll
probably set up some holding system for

120
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:58,439
probably set up some holding system for
 

121
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,939
probably set up some holding system for
a second minecart

122
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:00,949
a second minecart
 

123
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,369
a second minecart
but we'll do that some other time I want

124
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:04,379
but we'll do that some other time I want
 

125
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,899
but we'll do that some other time I want
to get out of here I haven't left this

126
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:05,909
to get out of here I haven't left this
 

127
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,250
to get out of here I haven't left this
area since last episode and yeah I think

128
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,260
area since last episode and yeah I think
 

129
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,470
area since last episode and yeah I think
it's I think it's time stretch my legs

130
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
it's I think it's time stretch my legs
 

131
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,530
it's I think it's time stretch my legs
go go see the world

132
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,540
go go see the world
 

133
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,550

134
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,560
Nazi world see the world so I guess I
 

135
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,759
Nazi world see the world so I guess I
will was I supposed to bring things oh

00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:22,769
will was I supposed to bring things oh
 

137
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,119
will was I supposed to bring things oh
this is probably fine I guess I'll see

138
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,129
this is probably fine I guess I'll see
 

139
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,300
this is probably fine I guess I'll see
you at the man cave or some other area

140
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,310

 

141
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,729

okay guys so one of the first things we

142
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:34,739
okay guys so one of the first things we
 

143
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,490
okay guys so one of the first things we
need to do here is switch out the beacon

144
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:37,500
need to do here is switch out the beacon
 

145
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,670
need to do here is switch out the beacon
at the man cave with gold blocks we have

146
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
at the man cave with gold blocks we have
 

147
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,699
at the man cave with gold blocks we have
to reclaim the iron and the emeralds we

148
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:43,709
to reclaim the iron and the emeralds we
 

149
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,080
to reclaim the iron and the emeralds we
had here now that we have the gold did

150
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,090
had here now that we have the gold did
 

151
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,569
had here now that we have the gold did
that do it yeah I think it turned back

152
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:50,579
that do it yeah I think it turned back
 

153
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,059
that do it yeah I think it turned back
on sweet that's cool got that one

154
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:53,069
on sweet that's cool got that one
 

155
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,550
on sweet that's cool got that one
working and we still have oh it's is

156
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
working and we still have oh it's is
 

157
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,649
working and we still have oh it's is
just about enough for another beacon

158
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:00,659
just about enough for another beacon
 

159
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,449
just about enough for another beacon
currently you need like two and a half

160
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,459
currently you need like two and a half
 

161
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,349
currently you need like two and a half
stacks of blocks mmm I'm tempted this

162
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:09,359

in the man cave you know what I locked

166
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:13,109
in the man cave you know what I locked
 

167

in the man cave you know what I locked
myself in here didn't I I think I did

totally built that the wrong way from I

172
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,930
totally built that the wrong way from I
 

173
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,850
totally built that the wrong way from I
went down and up instead of up today

174
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:28,860

 

175
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,469

you know it's a funny thing perspective

176
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:31,479
you know it's a funny thing perspective
 

177
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,330
you know it's a funny thing perspective
when I built this thing originally I

178
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,340
when I built this thing originally I
 

179
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,890
when I built this thing originally I
thought it was the coolest thing ever

180
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:34,900
thought it was the coolest thing ever
 

181
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,469
thought it was the coolest thing ever
and so many of you told me I was wrong

182
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:37,479
and so many of you told me I was wrong
 

183
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,740
and so many of you told me I was wrong
and now that when I see it today it is

184
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:40,750
and now that when I see it today it is
 

185
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:47,999
and now that when I see it today it is
so ugly yep uh-huh

186
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,009
so ugly yep uh-huh
 

187
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,950
so ugly yep uh-huh
so this is about it right here that

188
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:49,960
so this is about it right here that
 

189
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,929
so this is about it right here that
about about this line I think if we

190
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:51,939
about about this line I think if we
 

191
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,830
about about this line I think if we
cross over to about here yeah now we got

192
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
cross over to about here yeah now we got
 

193
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,439
cross over to about here yeah now we got
beacon effects so a big portion of the

194
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:58,449
beacon effects so a big portion of the
 

195
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,909
beacon effects so a big portion of the
man cave is actually not under under the

196
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:02,919
man cave is actually not under under the
 

197
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,129
man cave is actually not under under the
speed effect and I find it so annoying I

198
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:05,139
speed effect and I find it so annoying I
 

199
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,080
speed effect and I find it so annoying I
want to run around quick all the time

200
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,090
want to run around quick all the time
 

201
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,480
want to run around quick all the time
and when I come come to this area I have

202
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,490
and when I come come to this area I have
 

203
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,469
and when I come come to this area I have
to go solo so we're gonna set up another

204
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:13,479
to go solo so we're gonna set up another
 

205
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,159
to go solo so we're gonna set up another
beacon some somewhere between here oh

206
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:17,169
beacon some somewhere between here oh
 

207
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,890
beacon some somewhere between here oh
that will cover the second half of the

208
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:19,900
that will cover the second half of the
 

209
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,850
that will cover the second half of the
cave that we've expanded on too before I

210
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:23,860
cave that we've expanded on too before I
 

211
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,029
cave that we've expanded on too before I

254
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,010
basically just want a really quick mule
 

255
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,900
basically just want a really quick mule
for a bunch of them this guy doesn't

256
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:42,910
for a bunch of them this guy doesn't
 

257
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,680
for a bunch of them this guy doesn't
seem all that fast so I'm gonna be

258
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:46,690
seem all that fast so I'm gonna be
 

259
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,180
seem all that fast so I'm gonna be
breeding a few of them today and I'm

260
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,190
breeding a few of them today and I'm
 

261
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,810
breeding a few of them today and I'm
gonna pick the quickest ones and we will

262
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:51,820
gonna pick the quickest ones and we will
 

263
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,860
gonna pick the quickest ones and we will
use them for transporting stuff well

264
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:58,870
use them for transporting stuff well
 

265
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:12,680
use them for transporting stuff well
hello there oh look at all the bats

266
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:12,690

 

267
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,570

what's this

268
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:17,580

 

269
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:26,570

there's redstone down here this is the

270
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:26,580
there's redstone down here this is the
 

271
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,960
there's redstone down here this is the
laboratory why don't I have a ladder

272
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:30,970
laboratory why don't I have a ladder
 

273
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:48,800
laboratory why don't I have a ladder
here

274
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:48,810

 

275
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,480

okay so our new beacon is going right

276
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,490
okay so our new beacon is going right
 

277
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,680
okay so our new beacon is going right
here guys this is about 100 blocks away

278
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:55,690
here guys this is about 100 blocks away
 

279
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,830
here guys this is about 100 blocks away
from from the other beacon so they have

280
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:58,840
from from the other beacon so they have
 

281
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,220
from from the other beacon so they have
a radius of 50 50 plus 50 hundred blocks

282
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,230
a radius of 50 50 plus 50 hundred blocks
 

283
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,050
a radius of 50 50 plus 50 hundred blocks
so this should be a good spot for it I

284
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,060
so this should be a good spot for it I
 

285
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,120
so this should be a good spot for it I
would say and we're just gonna have the

286
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,130
would say and we're just gonna have the
 

287
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,890
would say and we're just gonna have the
one for right now because we were short

288
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:07,900
one for right now because we were short
 

289
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,780
one for right now because we were short
on gold blocks but we can easily get

290
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:09,790
on gold blocks but we can easily get
 

291
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,860
on gold blocks but we can easily get
some more later and I mostly just want

292
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:13,870
some more later and I mostly just want
 

293
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,990
some more later and I mostly just want
the speed boost anyway oh yeah let's

294
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,000
the speed boost anyway oh yeah let's
 

295
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,010
the speed boost anyway oh yeah let's
make sure it works

296
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,020
make sure it works
 

297
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,500
make sure it works
yep oh that is so cool a lot of times I

298
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:25,510
yep oh that is so cool a lot of times I
 

299
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,970
yep oh that is so cool a lot of times I
have to run between here and the

300
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:26,980
have to run between here and the
 

301
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,160
have to run between here and the
stronghold base to so this will make me

302
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,170
stronghold base to so this will make me
 

303
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,839
stronghold base to so this will make me
be able to get around a lot quicker so

304
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:32,849
be able to get around a lot quicker so
 

305
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,670
be able to get around a lot quicker so
next up on our list here I want to do

306
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
next up on our list here I want to do
 

307
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,010
next up on our list here I want to do
the horse Schaeffler stuff today in the

308
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,020
the horse Schaeffler stuff today in the
 

309
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,330
the horse Schaeffler stuff today in the
in our nether hub so I figure originally

310
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:42,340
in our nether hub so I figure originally
 

311
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,770
in our nether hub so I figure originally
I was considering putting them in the

312
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:43,780
I was considering putting them in the
 

313
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,130
I was considering putting them in the
corners here or somewhere like that but

314
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,140
corners here or somewhere like that but
 

315
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,760
corners here or somewhere like that but
I think it'll throw off the circular

316
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:49,770
I think it'll throw off the circular
 

317
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,620
I think it'll throw off the circular
supersymmetric room we have here so I'm

318
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:52,630
supersymmetric room we have here so I'm
 

319
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,880
supersymmetric room we have here so I'm
gonna put them over here instead I think

320
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,890
gonna put them over here instead I think
 

321
