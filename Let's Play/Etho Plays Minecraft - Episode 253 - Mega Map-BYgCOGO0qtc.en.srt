181
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,580
work over here a little bit to start off
with we really need to touch up this

182
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:13,590
with we really need to touch up this
 

183
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,700
with we really need to touch up this
area it's been this way forever and just

184
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,710
area it's been this way forever and just
 

185
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,040
area it's been this way forever and just

187
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,870
start off with I think I'm gonna put
some leaves behind here and then some

188
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:23,880
some leaves behind here and then some
 

189
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,850
some leaves behind here and then some
fences in fronts or like we did at the

190
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:25,860
fences in fronts or like we did at the
 

191
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,210
fences in fronts or like we did at the
mushroom farm give that a little bit of

192
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,220
mushroom farm give that a little bit of
 

193
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,570
mushroom farm give that a little bit of
a touch up there's really not much space

194
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:35,580
a touch up there's really not much space
 

195
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,430
a touch up there's really not much space
that we need to fill over here to

196
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
that we need to fill over here to
 

197
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,890
that we need to fill over here to
complete this wall so not doing anything

198
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900
complete this wall so not doing anything
 

199
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,640
complete this wall so not doing anything
major this wall this lower part is okay

200
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:43,650
major this wall this lower part is okay
 

201
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,040
major this wall this lower part is okay
but everything above that line there we

202
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,050
but everything above that line there we
 

203
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,040
but everything above that line there we
need to kind of fine-tune and then on

204
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,050
need to kind of fine-tune and then on
 

205
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,600
need to kind of fine-tune and then on
this wall see what this thing originally

206
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:53,610
this wall see what this thing originally
 

207
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,850
this wall see what this thing originally
was was like a cow chute to get mobs

208
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:55,860
was was like a cow chute to get mobs
 

209
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,100
was was like a cow chute to get mobs
down here if we ever need to get more

210
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,110
down here if we ever need to get more
 

211
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,590
down here if we ever need to get more
cows down I have this thing that goes up

212
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,600
cows down I have this thing that goes up
 

213
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,180
cows down I have this thing that goes up
to the surface and then there's a water

214
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,190
to the surface and then there's a water
 

215
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,260
to the surface and then there's a water

227
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,290
it's alright alright so yeah this goes
all the way up to the surface we don't

228
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,300
all the way up to the surface we don't
 

229
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,749
all the way up to the surface we don't
really need this here though I don't

230
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
really need this here though I don't
 

231
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,810
really need this here though I don't
think although we can leave it what I

232
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:39,820
think although we can leave it what I
 

233
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,270
think although we can leave it what I
want to do we got - we gotta fill that

234
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,280
want to do we got - we gotta fill that
 

235
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,580
want to do we got - we gotta fill that
space with something and I've asked

236
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:44,590
space with something and I've asked
 

237
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,230
space with something and I've asked
about this before in the past and the

238
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
about this before in the past and the
 

239
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,689
about this before in the past and the
common thing people recommend it is I do

240
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:48,699
common thing people recommend it is I do
 

241
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,719
common thing people recommend it is I do
some pixel art like a sheep face or a

242
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:51,729
some pixel art like a sheep face or a
 

243
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,749
some pixel art like a sheep face or a
chicken face or something like that to

244
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:54,759
chicken face or something like that to
 

245
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,050
chicken face or something like that to
go along with our cow face but this

246
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,060
go along with our cow face but this
 

247
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,510
go along with our cow face but this
isn't really you know sheep farm or a

248
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,520
isn't really you know sheep farm or a
 

249
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,749
isn't really you know sheep farm or a
big firm or anything like that one idea

250
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
big firm or anything like that one idea
 

251
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,620
big firm or anything like that one idea
I had though is maybe let's get some

252
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:07,630
I had though is maybe let's get some
 

253
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,899
I had though is maybe let's get some
maps going on here like a big map of my

254
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:09,909
maps going on here like a big map of my
 

255
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,860
maps going on here like a big map of my
worlds and try Center that on the wall

256
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:13,870
worlds and try Center that on the wall
 

257
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,180
worlds and try Center that on the wall
and then we'll put a frame around it

258
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,190
and then we'll put a frame around it
 

259
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,550
and then we'll put a frame around it
like we have with this and just see what

260
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:17,560
like we have with this and just see what
 

261
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,890
like we have with this and just see what
that looks like

262
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:18,900
that looks like
 

263
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,689
that looks like
so maybe the center of the wall is right

264
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:24,699
so maybe the center of the wall is right
 

265
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,070
so maybe the center of the wall is right
there where this fence is so that would

266
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,080
there where this fence is so that would
 

267
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,210
there where this fence is so that would
be up around there maybe if we think as

268
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,220
be up around there maybe if we think as
 

269
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:41,430
be up around there maybe if we think as
it's cut off here maybe we will try hmm

270
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
it's cut off here maybe we will try hmm
 

271
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,040
it's cut off here maybe we will try hmm
no we could probably put something there

272
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,050
no we could probably put something there
 

273
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,719
no we could probably put something there
let's put like a seven by seven big map

274
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:48,729
let's put like a seven by seven big map
 

275
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,320
let's put like a seven by seven big map
of our world there maybe I'll start

276
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,330
of our world there maybe I'll start
 

277
00:07:52,330 --> 00:08:02,120
of our world there maybe I'll start
laying it out and see how it goes

278
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,130

 

279
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:08,189

they hop faster well it's hard to tell

280
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:08,199
they hop faster well it's hard to tell
 

281
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:21,680
they hop faster well it's hard to tell
that is scary how does a scary sight

282
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,690

 

283
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,659

this is probably not my brightest of

284
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:24,669
this is probably not my brightest of
 

285
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,870
this is probably not my brightest of
ideas and yet I still want to try it so

286
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:27,880
ideas and yet I still want to try it so
 

287
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,620
ideas and yet I still want to try it so
here we go let's just see what happens

288
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:30,630
here we go let's just see what happens
 

289
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,899
here we go let's just see what happens
I'm wondering if I can like anger him oh

290
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:35,909
I'm wondering if I can like anger him oh
 

291
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,110
I'm wondering if I can like anger him oh
right right oh yeah okay that doesn't

292
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,120
right right oh yeah okay that doesn't
 

293
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,910
right right oh yeah okay that doesn't
work because monsters are nearby

294
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:43,920

 

295
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,890

all right that was a quick test and

296
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:48,900
all right that was a quick test and
 

297
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,670
all right that was a quick test and
let's get back to work

298
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
let's get back to work
 

299
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,840
let's get back to work
all right this works pretty good

300
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:54,850
all right this works pretty good
 

301
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,579
all right this works pretty good
actually uh I said I was gonna do a

302
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:56,589
actually uh I said I was gonna do a
 

303
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,400
actually uh I said I was gonna do a
seven by seven array of maps but this is

304
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,410
seven by seven array of maps but this is
 

305
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,410
seven by seven array of maps but this is
a seven by five and that's a pretty good

306
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:01,420
a seven by five and that's a pretty good
 

307
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,280
a seven by five and that's a pretty good
dimension I would say I think we'll do

308
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,290
dimension I would say I think we'll do
 

309
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,019
dimension I would say I think we'll do
the glowstone thing and trapdoor at the

310
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:07,029
the glowstone thing and trapdoor at the
 

311
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,130
the glowstone thing and trapdoor at the
waffles just to mimic the cow and then

312
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,140
waffles just to mimic the cow and then
 

313
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,079
waffles just to mimic the cow and then
we'll have our maps there and the center

314
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:13,089
we'll have our maps there and the center
 

315
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,329
we'll have our maps there and the center
is gonna be here basically where this

316
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:15,339
is gonna be here basically where this
 

317
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,470
is gonna be here basically where this
cow farm is and we're gonna do the high

318
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,480
cow farm is and we're gonna do the high
 

319
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,970
cow farm is and we're gonna do the high
detailed map let's go down I gathered

320
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:23,980
detailed map let's go down I gathered
 

321
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,070
detailed map let's go down I gathered
some materials to do this so I got my

322
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
some materials to do this so I got my
 

323
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,420
some materials to do this so I got my
fences I put down one block here and all

324
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,430
fences I put down one block here and all
 

325
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,850
fences I put down one block here and all
the towels went to the other side really

326
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:35,860
the towels went to the other side really
 

327
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,550
the towels went to the other side really
quick so no cows on the side which is

328
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
quick so no cows on the side which is
 

329
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,860
quick so no cows on the side which is
fine makes it a little easier to work

330
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:40,870
fine makes it a little easier to work
 

331
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,760
fine makes it a little easier to work
here I just want to do this I think very

332
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:46,770
here I just want to do this I think very
 

333
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,080
here I just want to do this I think very
simple

334
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,090

 

335
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:56,030

due to its framerate issues and then

336
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,040
due to its framerate issues and then
 

337
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,930
due to its framerate issues and then
what we'll do is replace most of this

338
00:09:59,930 --> 00:09:59,940
what we'll do is replace most of this
 

339
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,540
what we'll do is replace most of this
plain stone with the stone brick like we

340
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:02,550
plain stone with the stone brick like we
 

341
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,770
plain stone with the stone brick like we
have around the border there and yeah

342
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:06,780
have around the border there and yeah
 

343
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,170
have around the border there and yeah
we're doing fences pretty sure I really

344
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,180
we're doing fences pretty sure I really
 

345
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,940
we're doing fences pretty sure I really
like that look having leaves and then

346
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:13,950
like that look having leaves and then
 

347
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,570
like that look having leaves and then
fences in front or iron bars or

348
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,580
fences in front or iron bars or
 

349
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,660
fences in front or iron bars or
something

350
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:23,670

 

351
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:30,900

okay how's that might have to break it

352
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,910
okay how's that might have to break it
 

353
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,340
okay how's that might have to break it
up some more but let's just see what it

354
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,350
up some more but let's just see what it
 

355
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,650
up some more but let's just see what it
looks like from up here and now that's

356
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:37,660
looks like from up here and now that's
 

357
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,509
looks like from up here and now that's
we don't really need this drop chute I

358
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
we don't really need this drop chute I
 

359
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,400
we don't really need this drop chute I
probably put a ladder that goes up to

360
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,410
probably put a ladder that goes up to
 

361
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,939
probably put a ladder that goes up to
the UFO as well instead of just like an

362
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:44,949
the UFO as well instead of just like an
 

363
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:46,679
the UFO as well instead of just like an
enderpearl root up because I don't

364
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:46,689
enderpearl root up because I don't
 

365
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,600
enderpearl root up because I don't
really use it I find because I don't

366
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,610
really use it I find because I don't
 

367
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,259
really use it I find because I don't
know how to get up I think I think the

368
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:52,269
know how to get up I think I think the
 

369
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,240
know how to get up I think I think the
way I have it right now I have two ender

370
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,250
way I have it right now I have two ender
 

371
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,879
way I have it right now I have two ender
pearl up they do this oh yeah and that

372
00:10:59,879 --> 00:10:59,889
pearl up they do this oh yeah and that
 

373
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,879
pearl up they do this oh yeah and that
doesn't work too well does it right

374
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:02,889
doesn't work too well does it right
 

375
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:09,720
doesn't work too well does it right
we're gonna look at this don't die let's

376
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,730
we're gonna look at this don't die let's
 

377
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,509
we're gonna look at this don't die let's
look at it from different angles yeah

378
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
look at it from different angles yeah
 

379
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,110
look at it from different angles yeah
you can still see the water that's

380
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
you can still see the water that's
 

381
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,019
you can still see the water that's
interesting that's not too bad the

382
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:22,029
interesting that's not too bad the
 

383
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,429
interesting that's not too bad the
fences look a bit strange oh yeah we

384
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:26,439
fences look a bit strange oh yeah we
 

385
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:29,249
fences look a bit strange oh yeah we
should change it a bit we won't worry

386
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:29,259
should change it a bit we won't worry
 

387
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:30,629
should change it a bit we won't worry
too much about though I'm gonna work on

388
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:30,639
too much about though I'm gonna work on
 

389
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,240
too much about though I'm gonna work on
this some more I broke up the fence by

390
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,250
this some more I broke up the fence by
 

391
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,970
this some more I broke up the fence by
putting a split there in the middle but

392
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:38,980
putting a split there in the middle but
 

393
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,319
putting a split there in the middle but
even then it looked a little strange so

394
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:40,329
even then it looked a little strange so
 

395
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,749
even then it looked a little strange so
I'm trying these cobblestone fences and

396
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:42,759
I'm trying these cobblestone fences and
 

397
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm trying these cobblestone fences and
I know the choice is between that and

398
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,370
I know the choice is between that and
 

399
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,679
I know the choice is between that and
that and I think I like that more

400
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:48,689
that and I think I like that more
 

401
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:53,569
that and I think I like that more
although I'm not sure I like the mossy

402
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:53,579

 

403
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,490

now the choice is between the mossy and

404
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:56,500
now the choice is between the mossy and
 

405
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,639
now the choice is between the mossy and
the cobble fence and guess which one I

406
00:11:59,639 --> 00:11:59,649
the cobble fence and guess which one I
 

407
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:04,530
the cobble fence and guess which one I
like I like that one more the plain one

408
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:04,540
like I like that one more the plain one
 

409
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,259
like I like that one more the plain one
that one seems a little strange not

410
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:07,269
that one seems a little strange not
 

411
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,809
that one seems a little strange not
gonna lie one more thing to try here I'd

412
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:12,819
gonna lie one more thing to try here I'd
 

413
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,780
gonna lie one more thing to try here I'd
put iron bars so it's between iron bars

414
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:15,790
put iron bars so it's between iron bars
 

415
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,290
put iron bars so it's between iron bars
and the cobble fences and I am going to

416
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,300
and the cobble fences and I am going to
 

417
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,970
and the cobble fences and I am going to
choose don't actually know yet let me

418
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:23,980
choose don't actually know yet let me
 

419
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,200
choose don't actually know yet let me
think about it

420
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,210

 

421
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:36,160

very bad at making simple decisions uh I

422
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,170
very bad at making simple decisions uh I
 

423
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,490
very bad at making simple decisions uh I
think I'm gonna go with the cobble yeah

424
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:39,500
think I'm gonna go with the cobble yeah
 

425
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,860
think I'm gonna go with the cobble yeah
although we might do something different

426
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:41,870
although we might do something different
 

427
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,240
although we might do something different
if you guys have ideas what I should do

428
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,250
if you guys have ideas what I should do
 

429
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,090
if you guys have ideas what I should do
with that spot let me know but otherwise

430
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,100
with that spot let me know but otherwise
 

431
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,000
with that spot let me know but otherwise
I think we'll just do full cobble and I

432
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,010
I think we'll just do full cobble and I
 

433
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,400
I think we'll just do full cobble and I
started setting up our our giant map

434
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,410
started setting up our our giant map
 

435
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,560
started setting up our our giant map
over here

436
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:52,570
over here
 

437
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,750
over here
it looks a little strange because of the

438
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
it looks a little strange because of the
 

439
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,660
it looks a little strange because of the
stone brick and also there's no actual

440
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:58,670
stone brick and also there's no actual
 

441
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,610
stone brick and also there's no actual
maps in it yet so it's all it's all

442
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:00,620
maps in it yet so it's all it's all
 

443
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,800
maps in it yet so it's all it's all
planes so we will work on that as well I

444
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:04,810
planes so we will work on that as well I
 

445
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,750
planes so we will work on that as well I
think for the background let's just try

446
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
think for the background let's just try
 

447
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,700
think for the background let's just try
this out although there will be like the

448
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:12,710
this out although there will be like the
 

449
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,260
this out although there will be like the
colors are going to change once I

450
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,270
colors are going to change once I
 

451
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,530
colors are going to change once I
actually put the maps in but probably

452
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:17,540
actually put the maps in but probably
 

453
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,600
actually put the maps in but probably
will use either planks normal planks

454
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,610
will use either planks normal planks
 

455
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,760
will use either planks normal planks
because that makes a good background for

456
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:24,770
because that makes a good background for
 

457
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,140
because that makes a good background for
these item frames the other other idea I

458
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,150
these item frames the other other idea I
 

459
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,260
these item frames the other other idea I
had is maybe jungle planks or birch

460
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,270
had is maybe jungle planks or birch
 

461
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,270
had is maybe jungle planks or birch
planks let's try both of these and see

462
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,280
planks let's try both of these and see
 

463
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,600
planks let's try both of these and see
which works better or even even soil

464
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,610
which works better or even even soil
 

465
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,750
which works better or even even soil
might look good because it's a pretty

466
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:40,760
might look good because it's a pretty
 

467
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,640
might look good because it's a pretty
close color let's just try a few of

468
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:45,650
close color let's just try a few of
 

469
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,720
close color let's just try a few of
these okay so that's see that's really

470
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:52,730
these okay so that's see that's really
 

471
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,360
these okay so that's see that's really
close to the border color so that isn't

472
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,370
close to the border color so that isn't
 

473
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,290
close to the border color so that isn't
too bad either

474
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,300
too bad either
 

475
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,530
too bad either
and then we have these which is closer

476
00:13:59,530 --> 00:13:59,540
and then we have these which is closer
 

477
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:11,079
and then we have these which is closer
to the the mat color and then soil

478
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:11,089

 

479
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,860

hmmm I think I think this one might be

480
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:15,870
hmmm I think I think this one might be
 

481
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,269
hmmm I think I think this one might be
the best actually just because it

482
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
the best actually just because it
 

483
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:26,540
the best actually just because it
matches the same color as the frame yeah

484
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:26,550
matches the same color as the frame yeah
 

485
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,430
matches the same color as the frame yeah
yeah I think we made the right choice

486
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,440
yeah I think we made the right choice
 

487
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,850
yeah I think we made the right choice
here that's the winner really hides the

488
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:31,860
here that's the winner really hides the
 

489
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,160
here that's the winner really hides the
borders around the item frames nicely

490
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,170
borders around the item frames nicely
 

491
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,120
borders around the item frames nicely
and it seems to it it'll help make all

492
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,130
and it seems to it it'll help make all
 

493
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,210
and it seems to it it'll help make all
the maps join together better I am

this cloning would be really weird if

640
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:01,890
this cloning would be really weird if
 

641
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,160
this cloning would be really weird if
you could do this but maybe you can know

642

you could do this but maybe you can know
 

643
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,470
you could do this but maybe you can know
so you can't clone an empty map that's

644
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
so you can't clone an empty map that's
 

645
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,470
so you can't clone an empty map that's
good but I think you have to right click

646
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:09,480
good but I think you have to right click

you are if you're close it never
 

735
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,589
you are if you're close it never
flickers but if you're far away it does

736
