00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:38,579
here still not over it but I thought I'd
 

21
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,639
here still not over it but I thought I'd
try to get a video out for you guys

00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:40,649
try to get a video out for you guys
 

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,209
try to get a video out for you guys
today because I know you've been waiting

today because I know you've been waiting
 

25
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,069
today because I know you've been waiting
so let's get to it here guys

26
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
so let's get to it here guys
 

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,350
so let's get to it here guys
last episode we looked into this whole

28
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,360
last episode we looked into this whole
 

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,260
last episode we looked into this whole
bunny hole concept and you guys seemed

30
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,270
bunny hole concept and you guys seemed
 

31
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,270
bunny hole concept and you guys seemed
to really really liked it so we might

32
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
to really really liked it so we might
 

33
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,970
to really really liked it so we might
try to build that base using this today

34
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:55,980
try to build that base using this today
 

35
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,029
try to build that base using this today
I'm not sure yet though but yeah we

36
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
I'm not sure yet though but yeah we
 

37
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,889
I'm not sure yet though but yeah we
looked into some of the ways this works

38
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:00,899
looked into some of the ways this works
 

39
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,049
looked into some of the ways this works
and some tricks with it got some good

40
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
and some tricks with it got some good
 

41
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,640
and some tricks with it got some good
feedback from you guys too apparently

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:04,650
feedback from you guys too apparently
 

43
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,050
feedback from you guys too apparently
there's more tricks to it than I even

44
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,060
there's more tricks to it than I even
 

45
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,750
there's more tricks to it than I even
realized like one of the big rules I

46
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:08,760
realized like one of the big rules I
 

47
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,039
realized like one of the big rules I
thought here was you had to have a

48
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,049
thought here was you had to have a
 

49
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,710
thought here was you had to have a
transparent block above you so if we

50
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
transparent block above you so if we
 

51
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,560
transparent block above you so if we
look into oh I don't know if we're gonna

52
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:15,570
look into oh I don't know if we're gonna
 

53
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,130
look into oh I don't know if we're gonna
be able to see actually like you got to

54
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
be able to see actually like you got to
 

55
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,740
be able to see actually like you got to
have like a slab or glass block or

56
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:21,750
have like a slab or glass block or
 

57
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,020
have like a slab or glass block or
something non solid above you I thought

58
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,030
something non solid above you I thought
 

59
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,670
something non solid above you I thought
was a rule but apparently there's a way

60
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
was a rule but apparently there's a way
 

61
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,440
was a rule but apparently there's a way
around that as I fall here I have to

62
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,450
around that as I fall here I have to
 

63
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,819
around that as I fall here I have to
press the spacebar so sometimes I

64
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:31,829
press the spacebar so sometimes I
 

65
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,880
press the spacebar so sometimes I
prematurely press it like that but if

66
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:34,890
prematurely press it like that but if
 

67
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,140
prematurely press it like that but if
you get really good at it looks really

68
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,150
you get really good at it looks really
 

69
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,660
you get really good at it looks really
cool you just like automatically going

70
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:38,670
cool you just like automatically going
 

71
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,030
cool you just like automatically going
to the hole here okay so let's try this

72
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
to the hole here okay so let's try this
 

73
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,149
to the hole here okay so let's try this
apparently you can just force your way

74
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159
apparently you can just force your way
 

75
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,310
apparently you can just force your way
through the solid area so like because

76
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
through the solid area so like because
 

77
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,380
through the solid area so like because
there's a dirt block above there it's

78
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,390
there's a dirt block above there it's
 

79
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,810
there's a dirt block above there it's
not really letting me go into that space

80
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:50,820
not really letting me go into that space
 

81
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,280
not really letting me go into that space
but if I hold sprint yeah look at that

82
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,290
but if I hold sprint yeah look at that
 

83
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,230
but if I hold sprint yeah look at that
you can't actually force your way in and

84
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
you can't actually force your way in and
 

85
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,510
you can't actually force your way in and
then once you're in the solid blocks I

86
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
then once you're in the solid blocks I
 

87
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,249
then once you're in the solid blocks I
think it it allows you to keep going

88
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:01,259
think it it allows you to keep going
 

89
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,530
think it it allows you to keep going
here let's see what happens if we

90
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:03,540
here let's see what happens if we
 

91
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,940
here let's see what happens if we
transition because stone salt dirt

92
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:07,950
transition because stone salt dirt
 

93
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,790
transition because stone salt dirt
here's some stone yeah it's still going

94
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
here's some stone yeah it's still going
 

95
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,589
here's some stone yeah it's still going
even if you change block types so that's

96
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:12,599
even if you change block types so that's
 

97
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,640
even if you change block types so that's
kind of cool

98
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,650
kind of cool
 

99
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,030
kind of cool
that makes us way simpler like way

100
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
that makes us way simpler like way
 

101
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,339
that makes us way simpler like way
easier to get around because you only

102
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:19,349
easier to get around because you only
 

103
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,910
easier to get around because you only
got to mine one block then instead of to

104
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
got to mine one block then instead of to
 

105
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,670
got to mine one block then instead of to
every block you go forward and another

106
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
every block you go forward and another
 

107
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,110
every block you go forward and another
trick you guys showed me here is if you

108
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
trick you guys showed me here is if you
 

109
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,720
trick you guys showed me here is if you
have a non solid block so like a slab of

110
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:29,730
have a non solid block so like a slab of
 

111
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,940
have a non solid block so like a slab of
course you can then move into that slab

112
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:31,950
course you can then move into that slab
 

113
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,410
course you can then move into that slab
area but if you try to go forward you

114
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,420
area but if you try to go forward you
 

115
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,899
area but if you try to go forward you
get kind of get locked you got to force

116
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:35,909
get kind of get locked you got to force
 

117
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,460
get kind of get locked you got to force
your way through which is pretty slow

118
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,470
your way through which is pretty slow
 

119
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,259
your way through which is pretty slow
when you try to do that there's

120
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:39,269
when you try to do that there's
 

121
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,449
when you try to do that there's
apparently a cool way of getting by all

122
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:41,459
apparently a cool way of getting by all
 

123
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,539
apparently a cool way of getting by all
that issue though so I got it's a free

124
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:44,549
that issue though so I got it's a free
 

125
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,629
that issue though so I got it's a free
spot over there if we have a piston here

126
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:47,639
spot over there if we have a piston here
 

127
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,520
spot over there if we have a piston here
and then we go wrong way go right way

128
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,530
and then we go wrong way go right way
 

129
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,099
and then we go wrong way go right way
piston wrong way I wonder if we can not

130
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:55,109
piston wrong way I wonder if we can not
 

131
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,000
piston wrong way I wonder if we can not
place it the right way

132
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,010
place it the right way
 

133
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,309
place it the right way
oh no there we go okay so if we push

134
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
oh no there we go okay so if we push
 

135
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,460
oh no there we go okay so if we push
that dirt block above us while we're in

136
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,470
that dirt block above us while we're in
 

137
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,910
that dirt block above us while we're in
the the non solid block I think then

138
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:04,920
the the non solid block I think then
 

139
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
the the non solid block I think then
it's gonna automatically transition us

140
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,530
it's gonna automatically transition us
 

141
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,979
it's gonna automatically transition us
to the solid block and then you don't

142
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:09,989
to the solid block and then you don't
 

143
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,960
to the solid block and then you don't
have that really long wait time to get

144
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:11,970
have that really long wait time to get
 

145
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,720
have that really long wait time to get
through here like this you know so let's

146
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:14,730
through here like this you know so let's
 

147
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,229
through here like this you know so let's
go ahead and try that oh it actually

148
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
go ahead and try that oh it actually
 

149
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,150
go ahead and try that oh it actually
forced me out of that spot okay maybe I

150
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,160
forced me out of that spot okay maybe I
 

151
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,339
forced me out of that spot okay maybe I
didn't do that right okay I'm gonna hold

152
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:22,349
didn't do that right okay I'm gonna hold
 

153
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,390
didn't do that right okay I'm gonna hold
forward this time or left I'll hold left

154
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,400
forward this time or left I'll hold left
 

155
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,259
forward this time or left I'll hold left
yeah there you go you go right through

156
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:27,269
yeah there you go you go right through
 

157
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,559
yeah there you go you go right through
then there's no wait time so that's cool

158
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:29,569
then there's no wait time so that's cool
 

159
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,089
then there's no wait time so that's cool
okay a little bit of redstone here I

160
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:32,099
okay a little bit of redstone here I
 

161
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,270
okay a little bit of redstone here I
just wanted to see can you make this

162
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
just wanted to see can you make this
 

163
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,460
just wanted to see can you make this
transition a little bit easier so we're

164
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,470
transition a little bit easier so we're
 

165
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,830
transition a little bit easier so we're
going from the the slabs to the solid

166
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
going from the the slabs to the solid
 

167
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,439
going from the the slabs to the solid
clay block here if we do this it takes

168
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,449
clay block here if we do this it takes
 

169
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,240
clay block here if we do this it takes
like five seconds or so and you got to

170
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,250
like five seconds or so and you got to
 

171
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,250
like five seconds or so and you got to
hold control and you know there's a

172
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,260
hold control and you know there's a
 

173
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,500
hold control and you know there's a
little bit to it so I set this up so if

174
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,510
little bit to it so I set this up so if
 

175
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,240
little bit to it so I set this up so if
you put a pressure plate down it's going

176
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,250
you put a pressure plate down it's going
 

177
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,089
you put a pressure plate down it's going
to extend the sticky piston the slime

178
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:53,099
to extend the sticky piston the slime
 

179
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,289
to extend the sticky piston the slime
blocks will move this pink clay over top

180
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,299
blocks will move this pink clay over top
 

181
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,599
blocks will move this pink clay over top
where our head is so you'll notice this

182
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,609
where our head is so you'll notice this
 

183
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,210
where our head is so you'll notice this
is gonna switch to the pink clay block

184
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,220
is gonna switch to the pink clay block
 

185
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,550
is gonna switch to the pink clay block
when our heads there even still though

186
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
when our heads there even still though
 

187
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,559
when our heads there even still though
if I hold forward it's not letting me

188
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:06,569
if I hold forward it's not letting me
 

189
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,460
if I hold forward it's not letting me
through here so that's and it resets too

190
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,470
through here so that's and it resets too
 

191
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,009
through here so that's and it resets too
which is nice what you got to do is hold

192
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:13,019
which is nice what you got to do is hold
 

193
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,710
which is nice what you got to do is hold
sprint and then it lets you through and

194
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
sprint and then it lets you through and
 

195
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,750
sprint and then it lets you through and
you'll notice it's much faster than just

196
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
you'll notice it's much faster than just
 

197
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,689
you'll notice it's much faster than just
doing it the other way like just forcing

198
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:20,699
doing it the other way like just forcing
 

199
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,279
doing it the other way like just forcing
your way through it's like one second

200
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:22,289
your way through it's like one second
 

201
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,379
your way through it's like one second
instead of five but there's an even

202
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,389
instead of five but there's an even
 

203
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,810
instead of five but there's an even
better way it seems if you also move the

204
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:26,820
better way it seems if you also move the
 

205
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,200
better way it seems if you also move the
block

206
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,210
block
 

207
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,010
block
behind behind you get some more slime

208
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,020
behind behind you get some more slime
 

209
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,080
behind behind you get some more slime
down there then you don't even need to

210
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,090
down there then you don't even need to
 

211
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,400
down there then you don't even need to
press sprint you can just hold forward

212
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,410
press sprint you can just hold forward
 

213
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,670
press sprint you can just hold forward
super smooth that's cool that's the way

214
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:40,680
super smooth that's cool that's the way
 

215
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,770
super smooth that's cool that's the way
we're gonna do it and all I did here is

216
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:42,780
we're gonna do it and all I did here is
 

217
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,710
we're gonna do it and all I did here is
from that that's pressure plate got a

218
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:45,720
from that that's pressure plate got a
 

219
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,080
from that that's pressure plate got a
little repeater and then it goes up to

220
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,090
little repeater and then it goes up to
 

221
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,490
little repeater and then it goes up to
the piston here very simple oh man I'm

222
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:52,500
the piston here very simple oh man I'm
 

223
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,080
the piston here very simple oh man I'm
getting a little distracted here guys

224
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,090
getting a little distracted here guys
 

225
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,240
getting a little distracted here guys
but I just I just realized something we

226
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,250
but I just I just realized something we
 

227
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,510
but I just I just realized something we
can use this for transport which may or

228
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
can use this for transport which may or
 

229
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,969
can use this for transport which may or
may not be cool well it will be cool I

230
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:01,979
may not be cool well it will be cool I
 

231
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,409
may not be cool well it will be cool I
don't know how effective it would be

232
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:03,419
don't know how effective it would be
 

233
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,839
don't know how effective it would be
though so for example it tries to move

234
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:05,849
though so for example it tries to move
 

235
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,409
though so for example it tries to move
us towards an open air space like if

236
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
us towards an open air space like if
 

237
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,450
us towards an open air space like if
there's room for our whole body it's

238
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,460
there's room for our whole body it's
 

239
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,860
there's room for our whole body it's
gonna try to push us to that area

240
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:12,870
gonna try to push us to that area
 

241
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,159
gonna try to push us to that area
automatically so if I break this block

242
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:15,169
automatically so if I break this block
 

243
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,350
automatically so if I break this block
it's gonna move us there but if I

244
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
it's gonna move us there but if I
 

245
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,629
it's gonna move us there but if I
replace it before we get there we don't

246
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
replace it before we get there we don't
 

247
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,950
replace it before we get there we don't
leave the solid block mode here okay

248
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
leave the solid block mode here okay
 

249
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,930
leave the solid block mode here okay
well you could probably get it to work

250
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:26,940
well you could probably get it to work
 

251
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,879
well you could probably get it to work
is this not gonna be very good it's way

252
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:28,889
is this not gonna be very good it's way
 

253
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,450
is this not gonna be very good it's way
too slow let's try it it out a little

254
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,460
too slow let's try it it out a little
 

255
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,879
too slow let's try it it out a little
bit here I didn't fine-tune them the

256
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:34,889
bit here I didn't fine-tune them the
 

257
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,290
bit here I didn't fine-tune them the
timing or anything here but I don't

258
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,300
timing or anything here but I don't
 

259
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,490
timing or anything here but I don't
think it's gonna really be good anyways

260
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,500
think it's gonna really be good anyways
 

261
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,219
think it's gonna really be good anyways
let's get to the base building here guys

262
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:43,229
let's get to the base building here guys
 

263
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,540
let's get to the base building here guys
I have spent some time looking around

264
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,550
I have spent some time looking around
 

265
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,890
I have spent some time looking around
doing a little bit of planning I think I

266
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:48,900
doing a little bit of planning I think I
 

267
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,839
doing a little bit of planning I think I
got it figured out what I want to do now

268
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:50,849
got it figured out what I want to do now
 

269
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,719
got it figured out what I want to do now
for this mini base if we're gonna be

270
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:53,729
for this mini base if we're gonna be
 

271
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,589
for this mini base if we're gonna be
building a base we should actually have

272
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:57,599
building a base we should actually have
 

273
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,270
building a base we should actually have
it serve some function cuz if we just

274
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
it serve some function cuz if we just
 

275
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
it serve some function cuz if we just
build it like around the mancave area

276
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:00,810
build it like around the mancave area
 

277
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,129
build it like around the mancave area
never gonna use it it's gonna be for

278
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,139
never gonna use it it's gonna be for
 

279
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,290
never gonna use it it's gonna be for
show and I kind of want to build like an

280
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,300
show and I kind of want to build like an
 

281
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,360
show and I kind of want to build like an
outpost where a base that has a little

282
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,370
outpost where a base that has a little
 

283
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,420
outpost where a base that has a little
bit of everything in it so we're gonna

284
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,430
bit of everything in it so we're gonna
 

285
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,360
bit of everything in it so we're gonna
go a little ways off here and then if we

286
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,370
go a little ways off here and then if we
 

287
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,689
go a little ways off here and then if we
ever decide to build out this area

288
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:16,699
ever decide to build out this area
 

289
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,570
ever decide to build out this area
around this area then we will have like

290
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:20,580
around this area then we will have like
 

291
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,480
around this area then we will have like
a source of maybe some mini farms and

292
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,490
a source of maybe some mini farms and
 

293
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,659
a source of maybe some mini farms and
that sort of thing is the plan anyways

294
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:26,669
that sort of thing is the plan anyways
 

295
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,060
that sort of thing is the plan anyways
and it turns out if we go straight this

296
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,070
and it turns out if we go straight this
 

297
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,999
and it turns out if we go straight this
way I did a little bit of scouting where

298
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,009
way I did a little bit of scouting where
 

299
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:32,950
way I did a little bit of scouting where
we got here

300
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
we got here
 

301
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,650
we got here
well did I pass it already might have

302
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:35,660
well did I pass it already might have
 

303
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,770
well did I pass it already might have
passed it thought it was like straight

304
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:38,780
passed it thought it was like straight
 

305
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,950
passed it thought it was like straight
maybe it gotta go I don't know I think

306
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:41,960
maybe it gotta go I don't know I think
 

307
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,430
maybe it gotta go I don't know I think
it is a little bit this way this is an

308
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
it is a little bit this way this is an
 

309
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,920
it is a little bit this way this is an
area we've been to in the past yeah

310
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:47,930
area we've been to in the past yeah
 

311
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,540
area we've been to in the past yeah
right over here right over here so this

312
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:49,550
right over here right over here so this
 

313
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,060
right over here right over here so this
is actually one of our strongholds in

314
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,070
is actually one of our strongholds in
 

315
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,370
is actually one of our strongholds in
the world so this will give us a nice

316
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,380

635
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,420
they had enough of it that's like okay
we got to do something about this this

636
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,430
we got to do something about this this
 

637
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,390
we got to do something about this this
can't keep going on you know I should

638
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,400
can't keep going on you know I should
 

639
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,650
can't keep going on you know I should
maybe move this forward yeah so they

640
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:33,660
maybe move this forward yeah so they
 

641
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,630
maybe move this forward yeah so they
were like okay we got to break this kid

642
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:35,640
were like okay we got to break this kid
 

643
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,540
were like okay we got to break this kid
we got to stop this so what what ended

644
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,550
we got to stop this so what what ended
 

645
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,380
we got to stop this so what what ended
up happening

646
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,390
up happening
 

647
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,680
up happening
one day I dropped a box of crowns on on

648
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,690
one day I dropped a box of crowns on on
 

649
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,050
one day I dropped a box of crowns on on
the ground right and I refused to pick

650
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,060
the ground right and I refused to pick
 

651
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,730
the ground right and I refused to pick
it up like there was no way I was gonna

652
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:46,740
it up like there was no way I was gonna
 

653
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,560
it up like there was no way I was gonna
pick up these crowns so it's like okay

654
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:51,570
pick up these crowns so it's like okay
 

655
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,650
pick up these crowns so it's like okay
give him a spanking it's like okay

656
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:54,660
give him a spanking it's like okay
 

657
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,470
give him a spanking it's like okay
you're gonna pick up the crowns now no

658
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
you're gonna pick up the crowns now no
 

659
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
you're gonna pick up the crowns now no
give him another spanking

660
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:58,650
give him another spanking
 

661
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,770
give him another spanking
are you gonna pick up the crowns now no

662
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,780
are you gonna pick up the crowns now no
 

663
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,940
are you gonna pick up the crowns now no
and this went on and on for I was told

664
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:04,950
and this went on and on for I was told
 

665
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,670
and this went on and on for I was told
like three hours two or three hours I

666
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
like three hours two or three hours I
 

667
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,890
like three hours two or three hours I
believe ended up getting 37 spankings I

668
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:12,900
believe ended up getting 37 spankings I
 

669
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,190
believe ended up getting 37 spankings I
think it was in a row and finally

670
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,200
think it was in a row and finally
 

671
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,310
think it was in a row and finally
finally they broke me and it's like okay

672
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,320
finally they broke me and it's like okay
 

673
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,140
finally they broke me and it's like okay
I'll pick up the crowns and then after

674
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,150
I'll pick up the crowns and then after
 

675
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,910
I'll pick up the crowns and then after
that I was I was a good kid again I

676
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
that I was I was a good kid again I
 

677
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,060
that I was I was a good kid again I
wasn't stubborn anymore

678
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,070
wasn't stubborn anymore
 

679
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,319
wasn't stubborn anymore
all right well I think we

680
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:27,329
all right well I think we
 

681
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,910
all right well I think we
our balcony pretty much figured out here

682
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:28,920
our balcony pretty much figured out here
 

683
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,139
our balcony pretty much figured out here
I'd worked out some more details

684
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:30,149
I'd worked out some more details
 

685
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,840
I'd worked out some more details
off-camera so I tried to mix in acacia

686
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:32,850
off-camera so I tried to mix in acacia
 

687
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,239
off-camera so I tried to mix in acacia
wood in the in the sandstone there I

688
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:35,249
wood in the in the sandstone there I
 

689
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,499
wood in the in the sandstone there I
think that looks okay

690
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:36,509
think that looks okay
 

691
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,780
think that looks okay
then I added a like a brace at the

692
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:38,790
then I added a like a brace at the
 

693
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,530
then I added a like a brace at the
bottom there

694
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,540
bottom there
 

695
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,470
bottom there
triple brace kind of staggered them as

696
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
triple brace kind of staggered them as
 

697
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,960
triple brace kind of staggered them as
well I think that looks cool and some

698
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:44,970
well I think that looks cool and some
 

699
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,460
well I think that looks cool and some
flower pots and some carpet I think

700
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,470
flower pots and some carpet I think
 

701
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,910
flower pots and some carpet I think
we're gonna go for orange end and blue

702
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:48,920
we're gonna go for orange end and blue
 

703
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,439
we're gonna go for orange end and blue
colors for this baseless to go pretty

704
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:51,449
colors for this baseless to go pretty
 

705
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:53,359
colors for this baseless to go pretty
good together got some orange tulips

706
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:53,369
good together got some orange tulips
 

707
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,329
good together got some orange tulips
here uh-huh

708
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
here uh-huh
 

709
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,970
here uh-huh
I tried mixing in oak here I don't know

710
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:58,980
I tried mixing in oak here I don't know
 

711
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,280
I tried mixing in oak here I don't know
if that's a really good idea but we'll

712
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,290
if that's a really good idea but we'll
 

713
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,799
if that's a really good idea but we'll
try it for now let's actually get to the

714
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:03,809
try it for now let's actually get to the
 

715
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,960
try it for now let's actually get to the
crawling part of the base now that the

716
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:05,970
crawling part of the base now that the
 

717
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,999
crawling part of the base now that the
tunneling parts so this is gonna serve

718
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:08,009
tunneling parts so this is gonna serve
 

719
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,729
tunneling parts so this is gonna serve
as the entrance exits or one of them

720
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:10,739
as the entrance exits or one of them
 

721
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,160
as the entrance exits or one of them
there will probably be many of them and

722
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,170
there will probably be many of them and
 

723
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,049
there will probably be many of them and
it'll be something that hopefully looks

724
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:15,059
it'll be something that hopefully looks
 

725
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,939
it'll be something that hopefully looks
good in case we develop the outside of

726
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:16,949
good in case we develop the outside of
 

727
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:19,249
good in case we develop the outside of
this area too not just like tunneling

728
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:19,259
this area too not just like tunneling
 

729
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,549
this area too not just like tunneling
the whole time but let's let's get the

730
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:22,559
the whole time but let's let's get the
 

731
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,079
the whole time but let's let's get the
tunneling here all right so maybe we

732
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:27,089
tunneling here all right so maybe we
 

733
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,220
tunneling here all right so maybe we
would keep the carpet going and here's

734
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,230
would keep the carpet going and here's
 

735
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,519
would keep the carpet going and here's
the thing though I'm not quite decided

736
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:34,529
the thing though I'm not quite decided
 

737
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,859
the thing though I'm not quite decided
what I'm gonna do like oh we can do this

738
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:38,869
what I'm gonna do like oh we can do this
 

739
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,689
what I'm gonna do like oh we can do this
if we're if we're limited to a one high

740
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:41,699
if we're if we're limited to a one high
 

741
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,809
if we're if we're limited to a one high
area we're very uh we're not gonna be

742
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:44,819
area we're very uh we're not gonna be
 

743
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:47,389
area we're very uh we're not gonna be
able to do much detail right oh I got

744
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:47,399
able to do much detail right oh I got
 

745
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,210
able to do much detail right oh I got
pushed out darn it maybe we should try

746
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,220
pushed out darn it maybe we should try
 

747
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,909
pushed out darn it maybe we should try
to go for the too high I think it'll

748
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:52,919
to go for the too high I think it'll
 

749
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,129
to go for the too high I think it'll
look better in general and then some we

750
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:55,139
look better in general and then some we
 

751
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,840
look better in general and then some we
might have some tiger spots that are

752
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:56,850
might have some tiger spots that are
 

753
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,179
might have some tiger spots that are
only only one high let's maybe go for

754
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:01,189
only only one high let's maybe go for
 

755
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,730
only only one high let's maybe go for
four about this shape two by three two

756
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:04,740
four about this shape two by three two
 

757
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,059
four about this shape two by three two
tall three wide we'll do like a bit of a

758
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:08,069
tall three wide we'll do like a bit of a
 

759
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,329
tall three wide we'll do like a bit of a
tunnel to begin with here at the base

760
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:10,339
tunnel to begin with here at the base
 

761
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,220
tunnel to begin with here at the base
maybe maybe let's build out a stone

762
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,230
maybe maybe let's build out a stone
 

763
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,539
maybe maybe let's build out a stone
stone goes really good with the cyan

764
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:17,549
stone goes really good with the cyan
 

765
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:21,649
stone goes really good with the cyan
wool color you could do that along the

766
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:21,659
wool color you could do that along the
 

767
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,699
wool color you could do that along the
side and maybe just go like five blocks

768
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:25,709
side and maybe just go like five blocks
 

769
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,639
side and maybe just go like five blocks
and then we'll have another break here

770
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:28,649
and then we'll have another break here
 

771
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:34,549
and then we'll have another break here
so let's add some dark wood like that

772
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
so let's add some dark wood like that
 

773
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,759
so let's add some dark wood like that
ah my commentary is so good this is why

774
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:37,769
ah my commentary is so good this is why
 

775
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,320
ah my commentary is so good this is why
we don't do building guys I can't like

776
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,330
we don't do building guys I can't like
 

777
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,989
we don't do building guys I can't like
think and build at the same time I think

778
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:41,999
think and build at the same time I think
 

779
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,259
think and build at the same time I think
a lot of youtubers have this problem

780
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:44,269
a lot of youtubers have this problem
 

781
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:47,210
a lot of youtubers have this problem
it's very hard to be creative at and

782
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
it's very hard to be creative at and
 

783
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,970
it's very hard to be creative at and
like talking at the same time alright I

784
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:49,980
like talking at the same time alright I
 

785
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,820
like talking at the same time alright I
got an idea here for this little section

786
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:51,830
got an idea here for this little section
 

787
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,720
got an idea here for this little section
entrance to our base we're gonna

788
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:53,730
entrance to our base we're gonna
 

789
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,820
entrance to our base we're gonna
actually use fire I think with this base

790
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:55,830
actually use fire I think with this base
 

791
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,820
actually use fire I think with this base
that's gonna give us an orange color to

792
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:58,830
that's gonna give us an orange color to
 

793
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,070
that's gonna give us an orange color to
mix in with the blue when we're not

794
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
mix in with the blue when we're not
 

795
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
mix in with the blue when we're not
actually using orange I'm sure we'll use

796
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,090
actually using orange I'm sure we'll use
 

797
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,960
actually using orange I'm sure we'll use
a lot of orange tulips as well yeah

798
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:05,970
a lot of orange tulips as well yeah
 

799
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,810
a lot of orange tulips as well yeah
let's go to netherrack both sides here

800
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:08,820
let's go to netherrack both sides here
 

801
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,560
let's go to netherrack both sides here
we'll light this on fire like a so I

802
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,570
we'll light this on fire like a so I
 

803
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,970
we'll light this on fire like a so I
think that's outside of range yeah

804
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:13,980
think that's outside of range yeah
 

805
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,499
think that's outside of range yeah
that's outside of range of the carpets

806
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:15,509
that's outside of range of the carpets
 

807
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,119
that's outside of range of the carpets
and then brought some grills put those

808
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:20,129
and then brought some grills put those
 

809
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,519
and then brought some grills put those
in the front and then just probably

810
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:22,529
in the front and then just probably
 

811
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,810
in the front and then just probably
cobblestone kind of like that's sure

812
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:26,820
cobblestone kind of like that's sure
 

813
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,450
cobblestone kind of like that's sure
let's build this up and we'll slope the

814
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,460
let's build this up and we'll slope the
 

815
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,320
let's build this up and we'll slope the
ceiling maybe how should we do it well

816
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,330
ceiling maybe how should we do it well
 

817
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,989
ceiling maybe how should we do it well
we definitely need a slab here otherwise

818
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:38,999
we definitely need a slab here otherwise
 

819
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:42,200
we definitely need a slab here otherwise
we'll stand up I just I guess we got to

820
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,210
we'll stand up I just I guess we got to
 

821
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,379
we'll stand up I just I guess we got to
use stairs then so we'll do stairs over

822
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:45,389
use stairs then so we'll do stairs over
 

823
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,039
use stairs then so we'll do stairs over
here and over here and slab over here

824
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,049
here and over here and slab over here
 

825
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,049
here and over here and slab over here
kind of give it that shape see what

826
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:51,059
kind of give it that shape see what
 

827
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,970
kind of give it that shape see what
that's like let's go ahead and finish up

828
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:55,980
that's like let's go ahead and finish up
 

829
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,279
that's like let's go ahead and finish up
here okay flowerpots over there and over

830
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,289
here okay flowerpots over there and over
 

831
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,060
here okay flowerpots over there and over
there and over there

832
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,070
there and over there
 

833
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:09,129
there and over there
yeah okay maybe what would look nice

834
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:09,139
yeah okay maybe what would look nice
 

835
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,659
yeah okay maybe what would look nice
orange tulips is that gonna be too many

836
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:11,669
orange tulips is that gonna be too many
 

837
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,749
orange tulips is that gonna be too many
orange tulips I wonder it's quite a few

838
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:14,759
orange tulips I wonder it's quite a few
 

839
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,649
orange tulips I wonder it's quite a few
orange tulips alright so we got fire we

840
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:18,659
orange tulips alright so we got fire we
 

841
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,419
orange tulips alright so we got fire we
got weren't you two looks great so now

842
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:20,429
got weren't you two looks great so now
 

843
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,859
got weren't you two looks great so now
this next section here I think we're

844
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:21,869
this next section here I think we're
 

845
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,840
this next section here I think we're
gonna go for more of an intersection I

846
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:23,850
gonna go for more of an intersection I
 

847
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,700
gonna go for more of an intersection I
want to be able to turn left now and

848
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:25,710
want to be able to turn left now and
 

849
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,999
want to be able to turn left now and
start going that way let's see if we go

850
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:29,009
start going that way let's see if we go
 

851
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,539
start going that way let's see if we go
this way how far till we hit the surface

852
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:31,549
this way how far till we hit the surface
 

853
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,950
this way how far till we hit the surface
pretty soon here so we might need to

854
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:33,960
pretty soon here so we might need to
 

855
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,190
pretty soon here so we might need to
start going downhill as well so we kind

856
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
start going downhill as well so we kind
 

857
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,840
start going downhill as well so we kind
of want to go off off that way because

858
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:38,850
of want to go off off that way because
 

859
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,080
of want to go off off that way because
that's where the end portals gonna be

860
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,090
that's where the end portals gonna be
 

861
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,730
that's where the end portals gonna be
yeah I think I think what are the keys

862
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
yeah I think I think what are the keys
 

863
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,859
yeah I think I think what are the keys
to this building style when you're in

864
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:45,869
to this building style when you're in
 

865
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,600
to this building style when you're in
miniature mode here

866
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:47,610
miniature mode here
 

867
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,090
miniature mode here
is like this is one block tall this is

868
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,100
is like this is one block tall this is
 

869
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
is like this is one block tall this is
two blocks tall this is three blocks

870
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,510
two blocks tall this is three blocks
 

871
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,090
two blocks tall this is three blocks
tall so we're like in a three block tall

872
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,100
tall so we're like in a three block tall
 

873
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,460
tall so we're like in a three block tall
room even though it's a block and a half

874
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,470
room even though it's a block and a half
 

875
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,950
room even though it's a block and a half
everything gets shrunk down half the

876
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:57,960
everything gets shrunk down half the
 

877
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,060
everything gets shrunk down half the
size because of our lower in perspective

878
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,070
size because of our lower in perspective
 

879
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,060
size because of our lower in perspective
so to get more detailed like minecraft

880
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,070
so to get more detailed like minecraft
 

881
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,020
so to get more detailed like minecraft
is very limited I tried some something

882
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,030
is very limited I tried some something
 

883
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,490
is very limited I tried some something
here though you can see you can mix

884
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:10,500
here though you can see you can mix
 

885
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,830
here though you can see you can mix
stone brick and cobblestone very nicely

886
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:12,840
stone brick and cobblestone very nicely
 

887
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,610
stone brick and cobblestone very nicely
together I think this is cool so you can

888
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,620
together I think this is cool so you can
 

889
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,700
together I think this is cool so you can
get more detailed by texture mixing and

890
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:19,710
get more detailed by texture mixing and
 

891
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,330
get more detailed by texture mixing and
also they've they both have stairs and

892
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,340
also they've they both have stairs and
 

893
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,280
also they've they both have stairs and
slabs with the block type so that's good

894
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,290
slabs with the block type so that's good
 

895
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,380
slabs with the block type so that's good
so I have put some stairs here as well

896
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,390
so I have put some stairs here as well
 

897
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,530
so I have put some stairs here as well
and this room feels very detailed very

898
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:30,540
and this room feels very detailed very
 

899
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,720
and this room feels very detailed very
finished to me now let's go ahead and

900
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,730
finished to me now let's go ahead and
 

901
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,530
finished to me now let's go ahead and
move on here

902
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:33,540
move on here
 

903
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,530
move on here
so this next room the intersection I

904
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,540
so this next room the intersection I
 

905
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,000
so this next room the intersection I
think I want this to kind of go

906
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,010
think I want this to kind of go
 

907
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,230
think I want this to kind of go
something like that and then off this

908
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
something like that and then off this
 

909
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,890
something like that and then off this
way as well in the middle here we're

910
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:45,900
way as well in the middle here we're
 

911
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,680
way as well in the middle here we're
gonna have a drop maybe let's go for

912
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:51,690
gonna have a drop maybe let's go for
 

913
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,430
gonna have a drop maybe let's go for
some dark oak just for now probably it's

914
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
some dark oak just for now probably it's
 

915
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,490
some dark oak just for now probably it's
free by three hole here I would like it

916
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,500
free by three hole here I would like it
 

917
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,870
free by three hole here I would like it
if we could look down there without

918
00:20:59,870 --> 00:20:59,880
if we could look down there without
 

919
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,549
if we could look down there without
actually falling down I don't know if

920
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:01,559
actually falling down I don't know if
 

921
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,840
actually falling down I don't know if
that's gonna be possible

922
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:02,850
that's gonna be possible
 

923
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,940
that's gonna be possible
but we'll try it out and do that's okay

924
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:07,950
but we'll try it out and do that's okay
 

925
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,580
but we'll try it out and do that's okay
maybe maybe it's some fences around this

926
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,590
maybe maybe it's some fences around this
 

927
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,180
maybe maybe it's some fences around this
- should we let's just do it like this

928
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,190
- should we let's just do it like this
 

929
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,560
- should we let's just do it like this
all right we might mix in some stairs

930
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,570
all right we might mix in some stairs
 

931
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,330
all right we might mix in some stairs
with this dark oak just for more detail

932
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:20,340
with this dark oak just for more detail
 

933
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,250
with this dark oak just for more detail
as well but let's go for this right now

934
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,260
as well but let's go for this right now
 

935
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,570
as well but let's go for this right now
and stairs around here and then every

936
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:26,580
and stairs around here and then every
 

937
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:34,240
and stairs around here and then every
corner we might go up like that yeah

938
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,250
corner we might go up like that yeah
 

939
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,270
corner we might go up like that yeah
anyways let's continue on with our

940
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
anyways let's continue on with our
 

941
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,270
anyways let's continue on with our
sickness stock the the main person I
