yeah fully charging still seems to be
 

105
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,309
yeah fully charging still seems to be
the way to go that was much faster

might not be so severe if we don't do it
quite as quickly so maybe we'll try a

112
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
quite as quickly so maybe we'll try a
 

113
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,550
quite as quickly so maybe we'll try a
couple more times not as fast

114
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560

ah it's so hard to do testing and

134
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
ah it's so hard to do testing and
 

135
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,470
ah it's so hard to do testing and

uh let's let's try this guy okay so this
is

140
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080

it's really hard to say maybe i'll do it

146
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
it's really hard to say maybe i'll do it
 

147
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,190
it's really hard to say maybe i'll do it
a little quicker

148
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
a little quicker
 

149
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,110

guardian temple and then
put up these reeds and then this little

670
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
put up these reeds and then this little
 

671
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,590
put up these reeds and then this little
collection chamber below

672
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
collection chamber below
 

673
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,590
collection chamber below
with all the fence gates and stuff and

674
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
with all the fence gates and stuff and
 

675
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,189
with all the fence gates and stuff and
it should work decently but not

676
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
it should work decently but not
 

677
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,870
it should work decently but not
not too great as i have seen

678
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
not too great as i have seen
 

679
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,750
not too great as i have seen
so also this area needs a lot of polish

680
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
so also this area needs a lot of polish
 

681
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,470
so also this area needs a lot of polish
it looks

682
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
it looks
 

683
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,430
it looks
really crummy doesn't it like even the

684
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
really crummy doesn't it like even the
 

685
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,189
really crummy doesn't it like even the
little killing chamber here is

686
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
little killing chamber here is
 

687
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,590
little killing chamber here is
very very rough so let's do some stuff

688
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
very very rough so let's do some stuff
 

689
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,470
very very rough so let's do some stuff
here

690
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
here
 

691
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,509
here
the very first uh flaw i want to

692
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
the very first uh flaw i want to
 

693
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,509
the very first uh flaw i want to
tackle it's very obvious

694
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
tackle it's very obvious
 

695
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,470
tackle it's very obvious
one of the the biggest problems is the

696
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
one of the the biggest problems is the
 

697
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,990
one of the the biggest problems is the
guardians are getting stuck on this

698
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
guardians are getting stuck on this
 

699
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,750
guardians are getting stuck on this
glass here

700
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
glass here
 

701
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,750
glass here
and they just kind of sit there

702
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
and they just kind of sit there
 

703
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,430
and they just kind of sit there
eventually they will swim across to the

704
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
eventually they will swim across to the
 

705
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,230
eventually they will swim across to the
other side

706
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
other side
 

707
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,110
other side
the reason for this little uh overhang

708
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
the reason for this little uh overhang
 

709
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,389
the reason for this little uh overhang
here this lip

710
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
here this lip
 

711
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,430
here this lip
is because they won't cross the reeds if

712
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
is because they won't cross the reeds if
 

713
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,870
is because they won't cross the reeds if
they don't have water on the other side

714
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
they don't have water on the other side
 

715
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,430
they don't have water on the other side
to swim to so if there's guys over here

716
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
to swim to so if there's guys over here
 

717
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,550
to swim to so if there's guys over here
um they won't swim

718
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
um they won't swim
 

719
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,150
um they won't swim
into the reeds unless there's water on

720
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
into the reeds unless there's water on
 

721
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,069
into the reeds unless there's water on
the opposite side or at least that's the

722
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
the opposite side or at least that's the
 

723
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,590
the opposite side or at least that's the
way it was before so that's why i did

724
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
way it was before so that's why i did
 

725
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,870
way it was before so that's why i did
that

726
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
that
 

727
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,069
that

to be able to work on this without
getting killed

734
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000

i'm going to put fence gates up at the
second layer here and then

822
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
second layer here and then
 

823
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,829
second layer here and then
underneath that we're going to have

824
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
underneath that we're going to have
 

825
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,430
underneath that we're going to have
flowing water pushing them into the

826
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
flowing water pushing them into the
 

827
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,150
flowing water pushing them into the

it's not terrible
 

861
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,190
it's not terrible
uh but yeah so we got these fence gates

862
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
uh but yeah so we got these fence gates
 

863
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,789
uh but yeah so we got these fence gates
now they can fall through and they land

864
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
now they can fall through and they land
 

865
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,390
now they can fall through and they land
in the flowing water so the water then

866
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
in the flowing water so the water then
 

867
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,190
in the flowing water so the water then
pushes them

868
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
pushes them
 

869
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,270
pushes them
to the reeds as long as they don't fight

870
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
to the reeds as long as they don't fight
 

871
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,870
to the reeds as long as they don't fight
it too much and then they fall down they

872
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
it too much and then they fall down they
 

873
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,029
it too much and then they fall down they
go into the collection area

874
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
go into the collection area
 

875
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,310
go into the collection area
in the middle there they fall down to

876
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
in the middle there they fall down to
 

877
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,870
in the middle there they fall down to
the killing chamber down below

878
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
the killing chamber down below
 

879
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,350
the killing chamber down below
seems to have made the farm quite a bit

880
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
seems to have made the farm quite a bit
 

881
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,070
seems to have made the farm quite a bit
better

882
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
better
 

883
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,750
better
uh like there's no more dead zones where

884
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
uh like there's no more dead zones where
 

885
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,590
uh like there's no more dead zones where
they kind of just sit around they're

886
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
they kind of just sit around they're
 

887
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,430
they kind of just sit around they're
always getting moved towards the killing

888
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
always getting moved towards the killing
 

889
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,830
always getting moved towards the killing
zone now

890
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
zone now
 

891
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,150
zone now
and that seems to have increased the

892
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
and that seems to have increased the
 

893
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,830
and that seems to have increased the
rates of the farm quite a bit

894
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
rates of the farm quite a bit
 

895
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,070
rates of the farm quite a bit
i definitely think there's a lot of

896
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
i definitely think there's a lot of
 

897
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,070
i definitely think there's a lot of
caves around here that need to be lit up

898
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
caves around here that need to be lit up
 

899
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,190
caves around here that need to be lit up
still because like the spawning rates

900
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
still because like the spawning rates
 

901
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,190
still because like the spawning rates
aren't the greatest around here it seems

902
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
aren't the greatest around here it seems
 

903
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,990
aren't the greatest around here it seems
for these guys so i'll have to try to

904
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
for these guys so i'll have to try to
 

905
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,590
for these guys so i'll have to try to
find those they're really tough to find

906
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
find those they're really tough to find
 

907
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,270
find those they're really tough to find
uh because there's like a giant mine

908
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
uh because there's like a giant mine
 

909
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,110
uh because there's like a giant mine
shaft below this area

910
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
shaft below this area
 

911
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,549
shaft below this area
but yeah anyways the way we have it

912
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
but yeah anyways the way we have it
 

913
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,390
but yeah anyways the way we have it
right now they fall through the lava and

914
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
right now they fall through the lava and
 

915
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,470
right now they fall through the lava and
then they fall down take some fall

916
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
then they fall down take some fall
 

917
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,150
then they fall down take some fall
damage they burn up and then there's

918
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
damage they burn up and then there's
 

919
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,750
damage they burn up and then there's
some hoppers down there that pick up the

920
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
some hoppers down there that pick up the
 

921
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,710
some hoppers down there that pick up the
drops

922
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
drops
 

923
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,110
drops
we also had a system for sending them

924
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
we also had a system for sending them
 

925
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,350
we also had a system for sending them
through a portal into the nether

926
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
through a portal into the nether
 

927
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,510
through a portal into the nether
and i just kind of went through that and

928
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
and i just kind of went through that and
 

929
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,190
and i just kind of went through that and
fixed it up here made it

930
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
fixed it up here made it
 

931
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,710
fixed it up here made it
uh quite a bit more awesome so here is

932
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
uh quite a bit more awesome so here is
 

933

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
makes it so those pistons extend
 

943
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,549
makes it so those pistons extend
on both sides it closes it so they can't

944
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
on both sides it closes it so they can't
 

945
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,070
on both sides it closes it so they can't
fall down anymore

946
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
fall down anymore
 

947
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,470

thing for breaking the portal and a

970
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
thing for breaking the portal and a
 

971
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,150
thing for breaking the portal and a
flint and steel for lighting it

972
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
flint and steel for lighting it
 

973
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,110
flint and steel for lighting it
and it it switches every time we we push

974
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
and it it switches every time we we push

potion no that's the the glass breaking
 

983
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,510
potion no that's the the glass breaking
sound that's the

984
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
sound that's the
 

985
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,630
sound that's the
the sound the portal makes when it

986
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
the sound the portal makes when it
 

987
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,669
the sound the portal makes when it
breaks it's like oh

988
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
breaks it's like oh
 

989
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,870
breaks it's like oh
i don't i didn't know where that came

990
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
i don't i didn't know where that came
 

991
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,110
i don't i didn't know where that came
from for a second so yeah that makes the

992
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
from for a second so yeah that makes the
 

993
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,230
from for a second so yeah that makes the
the water budgets

994
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
the water budgets
 

995
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,590
the water budgets
go out breaks the portal i guess there's

996
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
go out breaks the portal i guess there's
 

997
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,430
go out breaks the portal i guess there's
a possibility that there's still a guy

998
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
a possibility that there's still a guy
 

999
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,230
a possibility that there's still a guy
stuck in here when that happens

1000
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
stuck in here when that happens
 

1001
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,870
stuck in here when that happens
but yeah the two different modes are for

1002
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
but yeah the two different modes are for
 

1003
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,430
but yeah the two different modes are for
like

1004
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
like
 

1005
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,029
like
total afk farming so

1006
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
total afk farming so
 

1007
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,950
total afk farming so
when they fall down here they just

1008
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
when they fall down here they just
 

1009
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,789
when they fall down here they just
automatically die if we want to send

1010
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
automatically die if we want to send
 

1011
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,149
automatically die if we want to send
them through the portal into the nether

1012
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
them through the portal into the nether
 

1013
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,950
them through the portal into the nether
we can collect like 500 of them or so

1014
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
we can collect like 500 of them or so
 

1015
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,029
we can collect like 500 of them or so
uh it's kind of like semi-afk farming

1016
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
uh it's kind of like semi-afk farming
 

1017
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,390
uh it's kind of like semi-afk farming
these guys

1018
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
these guys
 

1019
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,630
these guys
collect like 500 of them go to the

1020
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
collect like 500 of them go to the
 

1021
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,149
collect like 500 of them go to the
portal kill them all at once

1022
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
portal kill them all at once
 

1023
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,549
portal kill them all at once
we get xp that way and we also can use

1024
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
we get xp that way and we also can use
 

1025
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,430
we get xp that way and we also can use
our looting

1026
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
our looting
 

1027
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,950
our looting
effect from the sword we just lost

1028
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
effect from the sword we just lost
 

1029
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,789
effect from the sword we just lost
if we have looting we can get more drops

1030
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
if we have looting we can get more drops
 

1031
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,549
if we have looting we can get more drops
from them that way

1032
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
from them that way
 

1033
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,990
from them that way
uh so we got like two options with this

1034
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
uh so we got like two options with this
 

1035
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,070
uh so we got like two options with this
farm i think i want to make it so they

1036
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
farm i think i want to make it so they
 

1037
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,830
farm i think i want to make it so they
fall farther though because they're

1038
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
fall farther though because they're
 

1039
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,750
fall farther though because they're
they're taking quite a while to die here

1040
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760

 

1041
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,110

yeah i think we should definitely lower

1042
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
yeah i think we should definitely lower
 

1043
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,029
yeah i think we should definitely lower
that also we should check

1044
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
that also we should check
 

1045
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,270
that also we should check
out uh the portal situation here

1046
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
out uh the portal situation here
 

1047
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,190
out uh the portal situation here
because i think that was a mess too so

1048
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
because i think that was a mess too so
 

1049
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,390
because i think that was a mess too so
if we go through

1050
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
if we go through
 

1051
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,630
if we go through
i'm just gonna temporarily light this

1052
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
i'm just gonna temporarily light this
 

1053
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,390
i'm just gonna temporarily light this
just to check it out there might be a

1054
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
just to check it out there might be a
 

1055
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,710
just to check it out there might be a
bunch of guardians here

1056
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
bunch of guardians here
 

1057
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,230
bunch of guardians here
we will see hopefully not too crazy

1058
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
we will see hopefully not too crazy
 

1059
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,710
we will see hopefully not too crazy
it's a little bit crazy oh man oh man

1060
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
it's a little bit crazy oh man oh man
 

1061
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,230
it's a little bit crazy oh man oh man
okay run away run away yeah so i keep

1062
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
okay run away run away yeah so i keep
 

1063
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,669
okay run away run away yeah so i keep
having this problem

1064
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
having this problem
 

1065
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,669
having this problem
like i got the glass broken there and

1066
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
like i got the glass broken there and
 

1067
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,950
like i got the glass broken there and
it's kind of been like that forever

1068
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
it's kind of been like that forever
 

1069
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,510
it's kind of been like that forever
because

1070
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
because
 

1071
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,310
because
like when i use the portals i often get

1072
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
like when i use the portals i often get
 

1073
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,070
like when i use the portals i often get
teleported to there inside the killing

1074
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
teleported to there inside the killing
 

1075
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,750
teleported to there inside the killing
chamber

1076
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
chamber
 

1077
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,950
chamber
which is no bueno we need to

1078
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
which is no bueno we need to
 

1079
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,270
which is no bueno we need to
oh they're gonna kill me we gotta set up

1080
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
oh they're gonna kill me we gotta set up
 

1081
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,750
oh they're gonna kill me we gotta set up
another portal

1082
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
another portal
 

1083
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,470
another portal
that is preferred so we don't keep going

1084
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
that is preferred so we don't keep going
 

1085
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,190
that is preferred so we don't keep going
to that killing chamber

1086
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
to that killing chamber
 

1087
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,350
to that killing chamber
so uh maybe we'll try to put a portal

1088
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
so uh maybe we'll try to put a portal
 

1089
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,630
so uh maybe we'll try to put a portal
over here it's probably where it will

1090
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
over here it's probably where it will
 

1091
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,750
over here it's probably where it will
look the best

1092
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
look the best
 

1093
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,750
look the best
hopefully we can get it to line up the

1094
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
hopefully we can get it to line up the
 

1095
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,590
hopefully we can get it to line up the
way we want it to

1096
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
way we want it to
 

1097
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,390
way we want it to
yeah the idea is we're gonna have uh two

1098
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
yeah the idea is we're gonna have uh two
 

1099
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,750
yeah the idea is we're gonna have uh two
portals at the guardian farm

1100
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
portals at the guardian farm
 

1101
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,390
portals at the guardian farm
two portals over here so we want to be

1102
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
two portals over here so we want to be
 

1103
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,110
two portals over here so we want to be
able to go

1104
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
able to go
 

1105
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,430
able to go
back and forth uh between the guardian

1106
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
back and forth uh between the guardian
 

1107
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,110
back and forth uh between the guardian
farm and here easily

1108
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
farm and here easily
 

1109
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,110
farm and here easily
without ending up in the killing chamber

1110
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
without ending up in the killing chamber
 

1111
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,710
without ending up in the killing chamber
with the guardians because if we

1112
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
with the guardians because if we
 

1113
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,350
with the guardians because if we
get teleported into the killing chamber

1114
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
get teleported into the killing chamber
 

1115
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,710
get teleported into the killing chamber
we're not going to be able to get out of

1116
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
we're not going to be able to get out of
 

1117
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,029
we're not going to be able to get out of
it

1118
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
it
 

1119
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,630
it
if it's full of guardians so

1120
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
if it's full of guardians so
 

1121
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,950
if it's full of guardians so
we need two sets of portals and we don't

1122
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
we need two sets of portals and we don't
 

1123
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,710
we need two sets of portals and we don't
want them to

1124
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
want them to
 

1125
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,430
want them to
like mix up with each other so hopefully

1126
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
like mix up with each other so hopefully
 

1127
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,990
like mix up with each other so hopefully
this will kill us this will take us to

1128
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
this will kill us this will take us to
 

1129
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,110
this will kill us this will take us to
the guardian

1130
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
the guardian
 

1131
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,789
the guardian
portal over here now hopefully when we

1132
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
portal over here now hopefully when we
 

1133
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,310
portal over here now hopefully when we
go through this again

1134
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
go through this again
 

1135
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,710
go through this again
it takes us into the healing chamber

1136
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
it takes us into the healing chamber
 

1137
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,350
it takes us into the healing chamber
still and not with the one we just made

1138
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360

 

1139
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,390

good okay very good so we're where we

1140
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
good okay very good so we're where we
 

1141
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,230
good okay very good so we're where we
want to be

1142
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
want to be
 

1143
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,630
want to be
so now we just need one more portal over

1144
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
so now we just need one more portal over
 

1145
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,630
so now we just need one more portal over
at the guardian farm to link up with

1146
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
at the guardian farm to link up with
 

1147
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,470
at the guardian farm to link up with
this one that we use and the guardians

1148
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
this one that we use and the guardians
 

1149
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,789
this one that we use and the guardians
don't

1150
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799

1159
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,549
you know how it goes so i had a really
really hard time getting the portals to

1160
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
really hard time getting the portals to
 

1161
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,470
really hard time getting the portals to
link up like i wanted like they kept

1162
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
link up like i wanted like they kept
 

1163
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,070
link up like i wanted like they kept
interfering with each other

1164
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
interfering with each other
 

1165
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,750
interfering with each other
no matter where i put them like i tried

1166
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
no matter where i put them like i tried
 

1167
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,390
no matter where i put them like i tried
putting the portal like down here

1168
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
putting the portal like down here
 

1169
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,470
putting the portal like down here
try putting it over here try it over

1170
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
try putting it over here try it over
 

1171
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,590
try putting it over here try it over
here try it over here

1172
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
here try it over here
 

1173
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,310
here try it over here
try it here i tried a lot of different

1174
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
try it here i tried a lot of different
 

1175
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,669
try it here i tried a lot of different
places i just

1176
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
places i just
 

1177
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,149
places i just
i had a lot of troubles and i ended up

1178
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
i had a lot of troubles and i ended up
 

1179
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,230
i had a lot of troubles and i ended up
just putting it over here i think this

1180
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
just putting it over here i think this
 

1181
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,990
just putting it over here i think this
is a good spot for it

1182
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
is a good spot for it
 

1183
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,669
is a good spot for it
it's pretty nice you can just walk up to

1184
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
it's pretty nice you can just walk up to
 

1185
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,350
it's pretty nice you can just walk up to
it and

1186
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,360
it and
 

1187
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,710
it and
they don't interfere with each other

1188
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
they don't interfere with each other
 

1189
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,510
they don't interfere with each other
anymore this is where i had to

1190
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
anymore this is where i had to
 

1191
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,390
anymore this is where i had to
to put it in the overworld here like

1192
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
to put it in the overworld here like
 

1193
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,390
to put it in the overworld here like
just that little distance between

1194
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
just that little distance between
 

1195
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,269
just that little distance between
like where the guardian portal is in the

1196
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
like where the guardian portal is in the
 

1197
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,990
like where the guardian portal is in the
nether there and that one we just built

1198
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
nether there and that one we just built
 

1199
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,190
nether there and that one we just built
that huge distance in the overworld so

1200
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
that huge distance in the overworld so
 

1201
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,990
that huge distance in the overworld so
like from the middle of the farm to here

1202
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
like from the middle of the farm to here
 

1203
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,310
like from the middle of the farm to here
is how far apart we got to keep them

1204
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
is how far apart we got to keep them
 

1205
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,710
is how far apart we got to keep them
um but i think this is going to work out

1206
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
um but i think this is going to work out
 

1207
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,149
um but i think this is going to work out
pretty good so

1208
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
pretty good so
 

1209
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,190
pretty good so
like if we want to go to the nether um

1210
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
like if we want to go to the nether um
 

1211
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,710
like if we want to go to the nether um
i mean just go through the portals here

1212
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
i mean just go through the portals here
 

1213
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,549
i mean just go through the portals here
they're at uh

1214
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
they're at uh
 

1215
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,630
they're at uh
ground level this way you know and then

1216
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
ground level this way you know and then
 

1217
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,669
ground level this way you know and then
if we want to go

1218
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
if we want to go
 

1219
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,909
if we want to go
to the guardian farm i'm i'm working on

1220
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
to the guardian farm i'm i'm working on
 

1221
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,269
to the guardian farm i'm i'm working on
a thing here

1222
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
a thing here
 

1223
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,430
a thing here
basically and hop down here or we're

1224
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
basically and hop down here or we're
 

1225
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,029
basically and hop down here or we're
going to be able to

1226
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
going to be able to
 

1227
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,390
going to be able to
then i did like a diagonal passage

1228
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
then i did like a diagonal passage
 

1229
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,630
then i did like a diagonal passage
to the drop zone here and what i want to

1230
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
to the drop zone here and what i want to
 

1231
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,230
to the drop zone here and what i want to
do oh yeah and i tried lowering this as

1232
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
do oh yeah and i tried lowering this as
 

1233
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,230
do oh yeah and i tried lowering this as
well i guess we're very close to bedrock

1234
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
well i guess we're very close to bedrock
 

1235
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,669
well i guess we're very close to bedrock
already like this is where it was before

1236
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
already like this is where it was before
 

1237
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,950
already like this is where it was before
and this is bedrock so we don't have a

1238
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
and this is bedrock so we don't have a
 

1239
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,190
and this is bedrock so we don't have a
lot of space to drop them any further

1240
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
lot of space to drop them any further
 

1241
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,510
lot of space to drop them any further
and i think i gotta raise this up at

1242
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
and i think i gotta raise this up at
 

1243
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,190
and i think i gotta raise this up at
least five blocks so it's going to be

1244
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
least five blocks so it's going to be
 

1245
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,430
least five blocks so it's going to be
pretty much where it was i think

1246
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
pretty much where it was i think
 

1247
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,669
pretty much where it was i think
uh getting lots of drops now though like

1248
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
uh getting lots of drops now though like
 

1249
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,549
uh getting lots of drops now though like
this has just been filling up quickly

1250
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
this has just been filling up quickly
 

1251
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,590
this has just been filling up quickly
so much quicker than before

1252
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
so much quicker than before
 

1253
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,190
so much quicker than before
which is pretty cool like look how fast

1254
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
which is pretty cool like look how fast
 

1255
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,029
which is pretty cool like look how fast
they're coming down

1256
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
they're coming down
 

1257
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,789
they're coming down
without all the caves lit up so that's

1258
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
without all the caves lit up so that's
 

1259
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,789
without all the caves lit up so that's
i'm really happy about that

1260
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
i'm really happy about that
 

1261
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,909
i'm really happy about that
what we're gonna be end up doing here is

1262
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
what we're gonna be end up doing here is
 

1263
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,269
what we're gonna be end up doing here is
we're gonna have a bunch of chests

1264
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:25,279
we're gonna have a bunch of chests
 

1265
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,950
we're gonna have a bunch of chests
for collecting the drops we're gonna set

1266
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
for collecting the drops we're gonna set
 

1267
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,350
for collecting the drops we're gonna set
up item filters to filter them

1268
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
up item filters to filter them
 

1269
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,549
up item filters to filter them
and maybe a few other things and then

1270
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
and maybe a few other things and then
 

1271
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,909
and maybe a few other things and then
when we're

1272
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
when we're
 

1273
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,830
when we're
we want to go back i installed a

1274
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
we want to go back i installed a
 

1275
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,710
we want to go back i installed a
player elevator here these are so simple

1276
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
player elevator here these are so simple
 

1277
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,630
player elevator here these are so simple
to make it's so cool

1278
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
to make it's so cool
 

1279
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,669
to make it's so cool
let me just show you

1280
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679

 

1281
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,470

so from the pressure plate here just got

1282
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
so from the pressure plate here just got
 

1283
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,990
so from the pressure plate here just got
a four ticks

1284
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
a four ticks
 

1285
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,669
a four ticks
monostable circuit here so it goes to

1286
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
monostable circuit here so it goes to
 

1287
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,830
monostable circuit here so it goes to
the piston and then

1288
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
the piston and then
 

1289
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,390
the piston and then
one tick repeater here one tick repeater

1290
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
one tick repeater here one tick repeater
 

1291
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,590
one tick repeater here one tick repeater
here

1292
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
here
 

1293
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,750
here
and let's see actually we can see it a

1294
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
and let's see actually we can see it a
 

1295
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,269
and let's see actually we can see it a
little bit clearer the pattern from

1296
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
little bit clearer the pattern from
 

1297
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,830
little bit clearer the pattern from
above here so let's just go into our

1298
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
above here so let's just go into our
 

1299
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,110
above here so let's just go into our
our elevator nice and quick

1300
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
our elevator nice and quick
 

1301
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,149
our elevator nice and quick
takes us up right to the portals

1302
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
takes us up right to the portals
 

1303
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,070
takes us up right to the portals
and the pattern you can fit it into a

1304
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
and the pattern you can fit it into a
 

1305
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,590
and the pattern you can fit it into a
2x3 area and just

1306
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
2x3 area and just
 

1307
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,830
2x3 area and just
like keep staircasing your way up which

1308
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
like keep staircasing your way up which
 

1309
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,029
like keep staircasing your way up which
is pretty cool

1310
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
is pretty cool
 

1311
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,390
is pretty cool
so it goes um

1312
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
so it goes um
 

1313
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,830
so it goes um
dust one tick repeater then you go up

1314
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
dust one tick repeater then you go up
 

1315
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,470
dust one tick repeater then you go up
dust dust one tick repeater you go up

1316
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
dust dust one tick repeater you go up
 

1317
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,909
dust dust one tick repeater you go up
then you go up

1318
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
then you go up
 

1319
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,029
then you go up
and just keep repeating it over and over

1320
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
and just keep repeating it over and over
 

1321
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,110
and just keep repeating it over and over
every layer i tried to put some torches

1322
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
every layer i tried to put some torches
 

1323
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,190
every layer i tried to put some torches
in i think i might have missed this one

1324
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
in i think i might have missed this one
