that was close um
 

39
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,470
that was close um

i have half slabs here
 

43
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,389
i have half slabs here
and i'm not done modifying it there's

44
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
and i'm not done modifying it there's
 

45
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,950
and i'm not done modifying it there's
problems with this method too

46
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
problems with this method too
 

47
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,990
problems with this method too

half slabs
 

63
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,030
half slabs
unfortunately so if i stand in the

64
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
unfortunately so if i stand in the
 

65
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,030
unfortunately so if i stand in the
middle

66
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
middle
 

67
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,550
middle
i'll get a few of them but the majority

68
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
i'll get a few of them but the majority
 

69
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,990
i'll get a few of them but the majority
it does that thing where it looks like

70
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
it does that thing where it looks like
 

71
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,830
it does that thing where it looks like
they're they're by me but then they

72
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
they're they're by me but then they
 

73
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,230
they're they're by me but then they
teleport back to up there

74
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
teleport back to up there
 

75
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,590
teleport back to up there
um so you can't get over

76
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
um so you can't get over
 

77
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,910
um so you can't get over
something seth suggested to me is i

78
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
something seth suggested to me is i
 

79
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,789
something seth suggested to me is i
should use

80
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
should use
 

81
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,950
should use
upside down half slabs and i was like oh

82
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
upside down half slabs and i was like oh
 

83
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,149
upside down half slabs and i was like oh
yeah that makes

84
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
yeah that makes
 

85
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,510
yeah that makes
that makes a lot more sense that's a

86
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
that makes a lot more sense that's a
 

87
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,590
that makes a lot more sense that's a
good idea

88
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
good idea
 

89
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,630
good idea
so if we do that

90
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640

 

91
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,830

it works pretty good but it also has a

92
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

93
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,950

problem

94
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
problem
 

95
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,990
problem
and these i think like the thing is last

96
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
and these i think like the thing is last
 

97
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,510
and these i think like the thing is last
time the tnt was getting

98
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
time the tnt was getting
 

99
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,830
time the tnt was getting
uh knocked out of place uh from the

100
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
uh knocked out of place uh from the
 

101
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,350
uh knocked out of place uh from the
middle there when we were using the

102
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
middle there when we were using the
 

103
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,270
middle there when we were using the
pressure plates the half slabs seem to

104
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
pressure plates the half slabs seem to
 

105
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,190
pressure plates the half slabs seem to
prevent that

106
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
prevent that
 

107
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,070
prevent that
um so we got to have something solid

108
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
um so we got to have something solid
 

109
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,670
um so we got to have something solid
there

110
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
there
 

111
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,869
there
the thing is we got to find a

112
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
the thing is we got to find a
 

113
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,630
the thing is we got to find a
combination that works and still allows

114
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
combination that works and still allows
 

115
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,510
combination that works and still allows
us to get the xp

116
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
us to get the xp
 

117
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,350
us to get the xp

00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
have to punch holes in the glass
 

121
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,390
have to punch holes in the glass
in a bunch of places to make it work

122
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
in a bunch of places to make it work
 

123
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,190
in a bunch of places to make it work
wait wait wait a minute i'm not that

okay so now if we stand here we get the

134
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
okay so now if we stand here we get the
 

135
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,190
okay so now if we stand here we get the
majority

143
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,990

uh within the half slabs it almost seems

144
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
uh within the half slabs it almost seems
 

145
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,470

get one more uh but yeah you saw when i
 

173
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,710
get one more uh but yeah you saw when i
came up here a few xp orbs were still

174
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
came up here a few xp orbs were still
 

175
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,589
came up here a few xp orbs were still
lingering

176
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
lingering
 

177
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,350
lingering
around this middle so they didn't make

178
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
around this middle so they didn't make
 

179
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,750
around this middle so they didn't make
it on the all the way down

180
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
it on the all the way down
 

181
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,789
it on the all the way down
unfortunately

182
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799

 

183
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,710

so i have one more idea that's what i'm

184
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
so i have one more idea that's what i'm
 

185
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,630
so i have one more idea that's what i'm
looking for by the way these

186
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
looking for by the way these
 

187
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,030
looking for by the way these
um one more idea i'm going to try use

188
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
um one more idea i'm going to try use
 

189
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,390
um one more idea i'm going to try use
oh i can't use snow can i

190
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
oh i can't use snow can i
 

191
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,470
oh i can't use snow can i
if i use snow the water is going to wash

192
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
if i use snow the water is going to wash
 

193
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,350
if i use snow the water is going to wash
it away

194
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360

 

195
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,990

unless i melt it into place

196
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000

 

197
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,550

um i'm gonna try and make snow work that

198
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
um i'm gonna try and make snow work that
 

199
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,750
um i'm gonna try and make snow work that
might be

200
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
might be
 

201
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,869
might be
what we need and i think xp orbs might

202
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
what we need and i think xp orbs might
 

203
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,229
what we need and i think xp orbs might
be able to go over top it

204
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
be able to go over top it
 

205
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,390
be able to go over top it
can't use trapdoors because then that

206
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
can't use trapdoors because then that
 

207
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,070
can't use trapdoors because then that
would require putting a block like

208
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
would require putting a block like
 

209
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,070
would require putting a block like
here or something and then xp orbs would

210
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
here or something and then xp orbs would
 

211
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,149
here or something and then xp orbs would
get stuck on that too

212
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
get stuck on that too
 

213
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,550
get stuck on that too
um so i'm going to get some snow and see

214
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
um so i'm going to get some snow and see
 

215
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,630
um so i'm going to get some snow and see
if that if we can make that work

216
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
if that if we can make that work
 

217
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,030
if that if we can make that work
man what is that

218
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040

 

219
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,390

you hear that noise it's something is

220
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
you hear that noise it's something is
 

221
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,749
you hear that noise it's something is
walking around here is that

222
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
walking around here is that
 

223
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,110
walking around here is that
it's not you is it no it's not you

224
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
it's not you is it no it's not you
 

225
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,749
it's not you is it no it's not you
it must be a slime like a little slime

226
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
it must be a slime like a little slime
 

227
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,070
it must be a slime like a little slime
that can't really jump

228
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
that can't really jump
 

229
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,430
that can't really jump
you know what oh you know what it is my

230
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
you know what oh you know what it is my
 

231
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,350
you know what oh you know what it is my
hostile sounds are really low so i

232
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
hostile sounds are really low so i
 

233
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,189
hostile sounds are really low so i
probably can't hear him

234
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
probably can't hear him
 

235
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,310
probably can't hear him
oh yeah yeah where is he

236
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320

 

237
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,870

he's probably way up there oh there he

238
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
he's probably way up there oh there he
 

239
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,430
he's probably way up there oh there he
is

240
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440

 

241
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,030

okay mystery solved

242
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040

 

243
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,950

okay so snow slabs this is a bit of a

244
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
okay so snow slabs this is a bit of a
 

245
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,070
okay so snow slabs this is a bit of a
stretch i don't know if this is even

246
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
stretch i don't know if this is even
 

247
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,790
stretch i don't know if this is even
going to work but

248
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
going to work but
 

249
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,710
going to work but
if we just have one if you look at the y

250
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
if we just have one if you look at the y
 

251
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,550
if we just have one if you look at the y
we're still at 4.0

252
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
we're still at 4.0
 

253
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
we're still at 4.0
when we walk on it if we get one more

254
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
when we walk on it if we get one more
 

255
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,590
when we walk on it if we get one more
down though

256
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
down though
 

257
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,870
down though
it goes to 4.125 so an eighth of a block

258
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
it goes to 4.125 so an eighth of a block
 

259
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,590
it goes to 4.125 so an eighth of a block
every every slab you add to this 4.25

260
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
every every slab you add to this 4.25
 

261
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,749
every every slab you add to this 4.25
and a half slab is equivalent well a

262
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
and a half slab is equivalent well a
 

263
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,990
and a half slab is equivalent well a
slab just a slab it's equivalent to that

264
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
slab just a slab it's equivalent to that
 

265
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,070
slab just a slab it's equivalent to that
4.5 i believe

266
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
4.5 i believe
 

267
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,230
4.5 i believe
let's get one down just to check so it's

268
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
let's get one down just to check so it's
 

269
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,230
let's get one down just to check so it's
possible xp orbs can get over top

270
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
possible xp orbs can get over top
 

271
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,950
possible xp orbs can get over top
just uh if it's not as high like that

272
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
just uh if it's not as high like that
 

273
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,909
just uh if it's not as high like that
um and tnt is only 0.98 blocks

274
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
um and tnt is only 0.98 blocks
 

275
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,710
um and tnt is only 0.98 blocks
by times three like all all sides is

276
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
by times three like all all sides is
 

277
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,790
by times three like all all sides is
0.98 blocks so i think

278
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
0.98 blocks so i think
 

279
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,230
0.98 blocks so i think
this should be enough to hold it in

280
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
this should be enough to hold it in
 

281
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,550
this should be enough to hold it in
place and prevent it from going into

282
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
place and prevent it from going into
 

283
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,990
place and prevent it from going into
these these spots that we don't want so

284
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000

 

285
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,070

pretty sure this is going to wash it

286
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
pretty sure this is going to wash it
 

287
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,550
pretty sure this is going to wash it
away though

288
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
away though
 

289
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,790
away though
let's just try first

290
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800

 

291
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,870

nice placement what

292
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
nice placement what
 

293
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,909
nice placement what
i watched it okay so i'm gonna what i'm

294
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
i watched it okay so i'm gonna what i'm
 

295
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,070
i watched it okay so i'm gonna what i'm
gonna do

296
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
gonna do
 

297
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,430
gonna do
get these out of here such a simple

298
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
get these out of here such a simple
 

299
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,270
get these out of here such a simple
problem

300
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
problem
 

301
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,029
problem
like it's such a little problem and

302
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
like it's such a little problem and
 

303
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,189
like it's such a little problem and
there's should be a simple solution to

304
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
there's should be a simple solution to
 

305
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,469
there's should be a simple solution to
it but i'm having so much trouble

306
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
it but i'm having so much trouble
 

307
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,230
it but i'm having so much trouble
oh we can actually test it right away

308
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
oh we can actually test it right away
 

309
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,909
oh we can actually test it right away
here let's just kill a few of these guys

310
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
here let's just kill a few of these guys
 

311
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,749
here let's just kill a few of these guys
and head on down see if it'll go over

312
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
and head on down see if it'll go over
 

313
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,270
and head on down see if it'll go over
top

314
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280

 

315
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,469

no seriously

316
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
no seriously
 

317
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,990
no seriously
stinking xp orbs they can't get over

318
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
stinking xp orbs they can't get over
 

319
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,990
stinking xp orbs they can't get over
anything

320
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
anything
 

321
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,430
anything
huh

322
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440

 

323
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,629

let's try this one more time i guess

324
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
let's try this one more time i guess
 

325
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,830
let's try this one more time i guess
that just leaves me with the option

326
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
that just leaves me with the option
 

327
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,029
that just leaves me with the option
punching holes through the glass or the

328
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
punching holes through the glass or the
 

329
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,550

upside down half slabs
 

331
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,990
upside down half slabs
um i lose a little bit from that that

332
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
um i lose a little bit from that that
 

333
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,710
um i lose a little bit from that that
was the thing

334
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
was the thing
 

335
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,390
was the thing
and it really starts to add up if you do

336

just picked up a piece of gold

584
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519

 

585
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,829

i set up a track that goes underneath

586
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
i set up a track that goes underneath
 

587
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,870
i set up a track that goes underneath
each of these

588

each of these
 

589
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,470
each of these
drop points and it picks up

590
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
drop points and it picks up
 

591
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,590
drop points and it picks up
whatever whatever those guys drop on the

592
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
whatever whatever those guys drop on the
 

593

way you can pick up stuff if it's

598
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
way you can pick up stuff if it's
 

599
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,269
way you can pick up stuff if it's
if it's like um

600
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
if it's like um
 

601
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,629
if it's like um
against the iron bars here it's fine uh

602
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
against the iron bars here it's fine uh
 

603
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,310
against the iron bars here it's fine uh
it can reach that far but if it's on the

604
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
it can reach that far but if it's on the
 

605
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,829
it can reach that far but if it's on the
other side of the iron bars it won't

606
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
other side of the iron bars it won't
 

607
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,790
other side of the iron bars it won't
pick it up it's too far away then

608
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
pick it up it's too far away then
 

609
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,470
pick it up it's too far away then
uh so i got that thing going around on a

610
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
uh so i got that thing going around on a
 

611
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,829
uh so i got that thing going around on a
loop right now

612
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
loop right now
 

613
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,030
loop right now
let's see what it's done it's

614
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
let's see what it's done it's
 

615
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,949
let's see what it's done it's
just barely a stack of it right now i

616
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
just barely a stack of it right now i
 

617
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,110
just barely a stack of it right now i
haven't used it too much

618
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
haven't used it too much
 

619
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,190
haven't used it too much
and you saw some pigment just fell it's

620
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
and you saw some pigment just fell it's
 

621
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,790
and you saw some pigment just fell it's
not really supposed to work when i'm

622
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
not really supposed to work when i'm
 

623
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,110
not really supposed to work when i'm
down here but it does a little bit

624
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
down here but it does a little bit
 

625
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,389
down here but it does a little bit
now the idea with this farm and i

626
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
now the idea with this farm and i
 

627
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,470
now the idea with this farm and i
i should mention this was an impulse

628
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
i should mention this was an impulse
 

629
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,550
i should mention this was an impulse
idea oops

630
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
idea oops
 

631
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,230
idea oops
was uh one day i decided i want to make

632
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
was uh one day i decided i want to make
 

633
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,990
was uh one day i decided i want to make
a gold farm i wonder what would happen

634
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
a gold farm i wonder what would happen
 

635
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,230
a gold farm i wonder what would happen
if i made a gold farm where the zombie

636
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
if i made a gold farm where the zombie
 

637
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,629
if i made a gold farm where the zombie
pigmen spawn below the ceiling

638
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
pigmen spawn below the ceiling
 

639
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,829
pigmen spawn below the ceiling
and i i sit above it and i figured

640
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
and i i sit above it and i figured
 

641
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,190
and i i sit above it and i figured
it would work pretty good and i wouldn't

642
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
it would work pretty good and i wouldn't
 

643
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,829
it would work pretty good and i wouldn't
have to do a lot of work with it

644
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839

 

645
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,750

it's been quite a bit of work but i mean

646
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
it's been quite a bit of work but i mean
 

647
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,350
it's been quite a bit of work but i mean
i wouldn't have to clear out as much

648
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
i wouldn't have to clear out as much
 

649
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,110
i wouldn't have to clear out as much
netherrack as if i was to build

650
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
netherrack as if i was to build
 

651
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,590
netherrack as if i was to build
uh a different type of zombie pigman

652
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
uh a different type of zombie pigman
 

653
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,590
uh a different type of zombie pigman
farm not a not a portal one but just the

654
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
farm not a not a portal one but just the
 

655
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,269

00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
regular spawning pad one
 

657
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,790
regular spawning pad one
i would have to clear out a ton of

658
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
i would have to clear out a ton of
 

659
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,110
i would have to clear out a ton of
netherrack for that

660
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
netherrack for that
 

661
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,069
netherrack for that
so this is experimental concept and i

662
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
so this is experimental concept and i
 

663
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,230
so this is experimental concept and i
didn't plan it out too well

664
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
didn't plan it out too well
 

665
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,829
didn't plan it out too well
when i first came up with it and

666
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
when i first came up with it and
 

667
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,069
when i first came up with it and
now now i'm working out the details and

668
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
now now i'm working out the details and
 

669
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,269
now now i'm working out the details and
i'm i'm wondering how

670
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
i'm i'm wondering how
 

671
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,350
i'm i'm wondering how
things actually work so the idea is

672
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360

 

673
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,030

when i'm up on the ladder above the

674
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
when i'm up on the ladder above the
 

675
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,870
when i'm up on the ladder above the
ceiling there i want

676
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
ceiling there i want
 

677
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,150
ceiling there i want
spawning pads to be just within

678
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
spawning pads to be just within
 

679
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,829
spawning pads to be just within
128 blocks where they can spawn

680
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
128 blocks where they can spawn
 

681
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,150
128 blocks where they can spawn
the thing is i'm dropping them now

682
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
the thing is i'm dropping them now
 

683
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,710
the thing is i'm dropping them now
and they drop like 20 blocks or so and

684
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
and they drop like 20 blocks or so and
 

685
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,870
and they drop like 20 blocks or so and
there's this rule in minecraft if a mob

686
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
there's this rule in minecraft if a mob
 

687
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,829
there's this rule in minecraft if a mob
is

688
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
is
 

689
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,150
is
more than 128 blocks away from your

690
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
more than 128 blocks away from your
 

691
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,590
more than 128 blocks away from your
player

692
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
player
 

693
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,990
player
then they despawn very quickly

694
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000

 

695
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,269

the question is this is the detail

696
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
the question is this is the detail
 

697
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,670
the question is this is the detail
i haven't worked out i've never known if

698
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
i haven't worked out i've never known if
 

699
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,150
i haven't worked out i've never known if
if they despawn like in a few seconds or

700
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
if they despawn like in a few seconds or
 

701
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,949
if they despawn like in a few seconds or
if it's like

702
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
if it's like
 

703
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,710
if it's like
instant like the next updates

704
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
instant like the next updates
 

705
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,790
instant like the next updates
it checks it instantly just spawns

706
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
it checks it instantly just spawns
 

707
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,990
it checks it instantly just spawns
anything

708
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
anything
 

709
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,389
anything
outside of 128 blocks it's something you

710
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
outside of 128 blocks it's something you
 

711
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,910
outside of 128 blocks it's something you
can't really figure out too well in this

712
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
can't really figure out too well in this
 

713
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,310
can't really figure out too well in this
game

714
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
game
 

715
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,590
game
unless you're looking at the game code

716
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
unless you're looking at the game code
 

717
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,470
unless you're looking at the game code
so i've never never figured that out

718
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
so i've never never figured that out
 

719
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,389
so i've never never figured that out
exactly i'm sure somebody will tell me

720
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
exactly i'm sure somebody will tell me
 

721
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,189
exactly i'm sure somebody will tell me
in the comments um somebody that's

722
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
in the comments um somebody that's
 

723
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,790
in the comments um somebody that's
looked at the code

724
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
looked at the code
 

725
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,470
looked at the code
but regardless i should be able to

726
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
but regardless i should be able to
 

727
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,710
but regardless i should be able to
figure out in game i'm pretty sure they

728
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
figure out in game i'm pretty sure they
 

729
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,310
figure out in game i'm pretty sure they
are despawning instantly

730
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
are despawning instantly
 

731
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,030
are despawning instantly
so as they're dropping they're

732
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
so as they're dropping they're
 

733
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,150
so as they're dropping they're
despawning if

734
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
despawning if
 

735
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,670
despawning if
if they could just stay around for a

736
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
if they could just stay around for a
 

737
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,430
if they could just stay around for a
second they would hit the ground and

738
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
second they would hit the ground and
 

739
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,750
second they would hit the ground and
i would get the gold

740
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760

 

741
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,870

if you know what i'm talking about

742
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
if you know what i'm talking about
 

743
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,829
if you know what i'm talking about
anyway so what we're going to do here

744
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
anyway so what we're going to do here
 

745
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,389
anyway so what we're going to do here
which will help us figure it out in game

746
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
which will help us figure it out in game
 

747
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,350
which will help us figure it out in game
in case i don't find out from somebody

748
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
in case i don't find out from somebody
 

749
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,590
in case i don't find out from somebody
is we're going to set up an item

750
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
is we're going to set up an item
 

751
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,110
is we're going to set up an item
elevator

752
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
elevator
 

753
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,750
elevator
that will transport the gold up above

754
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
that will transport the gold up above
 

755
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,269
that will transport the gold up above
the ceiling because

756
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
the ceiling because
 

757
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,030
the ceiling because
when i'm up there i have no idea really

758
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
when i'm up there i have no idea really
 

759
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,509
when i'm up there i have no idea really
what's going on down below

760
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
what's going on down below
 

761
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,590
what's going on down below
i have no indicator so if we set up

762
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
i have no indicator so if we set up
 

763
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,110
i have no indicator so if we set up
some way of sending gold up there i

764
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
some way of sending gold up there i
 

765
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
some way of sending gold up there i
could see what kind of rates i'm getting

766
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
could see what kind of rates i'm getting
 

767
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,430
could see what kind of rates i'm getting
while i'm above the ceiling

768
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
while i'm above the ceiling
 

769
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,710
while i'm above the ceiling
um i'm sure let's get a farm or not a

770
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
um i'm sure let's get a farm or not a
 

771
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,350
um i'm sure let's get a farm or not a
farm

772
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
farm
 

773
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,030
farm
elevator going i came up with a pretty

774
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
elevator going i came up with a pretty
 

775
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,949
elevator going i came up with a pretty
cool design for one i guess

776
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959

 

777
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,069

you can probably make it come out here

778
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
you can probably make it come out here
 

779
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,670
you can probably make it come out here
where's a good place to go up

780
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680

 

781
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,110

maybe this corner let's go outside a bit

782
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
maybe this corner let's go outside a bit
 

783
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,629
maybe this corner let's go outside a bit
again maybe i'll clear out some more of

784
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
again maybe i'll clear out some more of
 

785
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,470
again maybe i'll clear out some more of
this land and make it come outside

786
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480

 

787
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,629

after considering it i decided to put

788
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
after considering it i decided to put
 

789
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,550
after considering it i decided to put
the item elevator over here instead of

790
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
the item elevator over here instead of
 

791
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,949
the item elevator over here instead of
over

792
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
over
 

793
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,269
over
there because this is the middle of the

794
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
there because this is the middle of the
 

795
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,310
there because this is the middle of the
farm

796
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
farm
 

797
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,629
farm
on the side that gets the least gas so i

798
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
on the side that gets the least gas so i
 

799
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,829
on the side that gets the least gas so i
think uh

800
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
think uh
 

801
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,749
think uh
should be good and it's going to come up

802
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
should be good and it's going to come up
 

803
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,829
should be good and it's going to come up
right on the outside of the farm

804
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
right on the outside of the farm
 

805
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,269
right on the outside of the farm
i don't want it close to the spawning

806
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
i don't want it close to the spawning
 

807
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,829
i don't want it close to the spawning
pads because that will affect the rates

808
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
pads because that will affect the rates
 

809
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,470
pads because that will affect the rates
um

810
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
um
 

811
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,389
um
the closer it is to them so

812
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
the closer it is to them so
 

813
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,949
the closer it is to them so
let's begin so this is a pretty cool

814
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
let's begin so this is a pretty cool
 

815
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,509
let's begin so this is a pretty cool
design

816
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
design
 

817
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,389
design
what we're gonna do is make the this

818
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
what we're gonna do is make the this
 

819
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,629
what we're gonna do is make the this
minecart will come out

820
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
minecart will come out
 

821
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,790
minecart will come out
let's make it come out over here on the

822
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
let's make it come out over here on the
 

823
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,269
let's make it come out over here on the
outside of the item elevator

824
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
outside of the item elevator
 

825
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,550
outside of the item elevator
um

826
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560

 

827
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,350

and i'm trying to think of how to do

828
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
and i'm trying to think of how to do
 

829
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,550
and i'm trying to think of how to do
this

830
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
this
 

831
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,829
this
i just built this today so i'm going by

832
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
i just built this today so i'm going by
 

833
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,069
i just built this today so i'm going by
memory

834
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
memory
 

835
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,990
memory
we're gonna have two hoppers like that

836
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
we're gonna have two hoppers like that
 

837
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,110
we're gonna have two hoppers like that
and uh power rail over top this is where

838
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
and uh power rail over top this is where
 

839
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,430
and uh power rail over top this is where
the minecart is gonna unload right here

840
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
the minecart is gonna unload right here
 

841
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,829
the minecart is gonna unload right here
and it's gonna unload

842
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839

 

843
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,230

into

844
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
into
 

845
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,990
into
dropper

846
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000

 

847
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,150

like so and then we want an airspace for

848
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
like so and then we want an airspace for
 

849
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,429
like so and then we want an airspace for
this dropper to shoot

850
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
this dropper to shoot
 

851
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,110
this dropper to shoot
the items into

852
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120

 

853
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,549

and then we want a piston below that

854
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
and then we want a piston below that
 

855
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,510
and then we want a piston below that
that will come up and squish the items

856
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
that will come up and squish the items
 

857
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,029
that will come up and squish the items
that we shoot out

858
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
that we shoot out
 

859
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,949
that we shoot out
so that they flow upwards we got to make

860
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
so that they flow upwards we got to make
 

861
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,029
so that they flow upwards we got to make
sure there's no air spaces around though

862
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
sure there's no air spaces around though
 

863
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,950
sure there's no air spaces around though
otherwise it won't work

864
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
otherwise it won't work
 

865
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,669
otherwise it won't work
maybe we'll make this out of glass space

866
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
maybe we'll make this out of glass space
 

867
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,549
maybe we'll make this out of glass space
base layers

868
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
base layers
 

869
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,909
base layers
anyway so

870
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
anyway so
 

871
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,510
anyway so
we can see what's going on a little

872
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
we can see what's going on a little
 

873
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,950
we can see what's going on a little
better

874
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960

 

875
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,029

okay so items will will shoot in this

876
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
okay so items will will shoot in this
 

877
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,990
okay so items will will shoot in this
one by one by one

878
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
one by one by one
 

879
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,669
one by one by one
hole here and we're gonna hook up a

880
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
hole here and we're gonna hook up a
 

881
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,350
hole here and we're gonna hook up a
little bit of redstone it's not too

882
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
little bit of redstone it's not too
 

883
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,710
little bit of redstone it's not too
complicated

884
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720

 

885
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,630

and lay down a base people always ask me

886
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
and lay down a base people always ask me
 

887
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,990
and lay down a base people always ask me
why i use stone bricks

888
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
why i use stone bricks
 

889
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,990
why i use stone bricks
for redstone um i don't like using

890
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
for redstone um i don't like using
 

891
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,830
for redstone um i don't like using
like cobblestone is so abundant in this

892
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
like cobblestone is so abundant in this
 

893
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,190
like cobblestone is so abundant in this
game it's a good block

894
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
game it's a good block
 

895
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,510
game it's a good block
it's fairly blast resistant if you're

896
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
it's fairly blast resistant if you're
 

897
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,430
it's fairly blast resistant if you're
dealing with creepers

898
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
dealing with creepers
 

899
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,669
dealing with creepers
and you can see the redstone clearly on

900
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
and you can see the redstone clearly on
 

901
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,950
and you can see the redstone clearly on
it

902
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
it
 

903
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,070
it
um i often will

904
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
um i often will
 

905
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,110
um i often will
place cobblestone and

906
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
place cobblestone and
 

907
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,310
place cobblestone and
uh stone you see everywhere throughout

908
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
uh stone you see everywhere throughout
 

909
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,430
uh stone you see everywhere throughout
the world but if i

910
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
the world but if i
 

911
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,350
the world but if i
if i use stone brick i know it's a block

912
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
if i use stone brick i know it's a block
 

913
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,870
if i use stone brick i know it's a block
that's important

914
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
that's important
 

915
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,710
that's important
so if i'm mining around in my cave and i

916
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
so if i'm mining around in my cave and i
 

917
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,470
so if i'm mining around in my cave and i
see that i know not to break it because

918
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
see that i know not to break it because
 

919
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,669
see that i know not to break it because
there's probably redstone on top of it

920
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
there's probably redstone on top of it
 

921
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,510
there's probably redstone on top of it
so that's why i use stone brick it's a

922
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
so that's why i use stone brick it's a
 

923
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,789
so that's why i use stone brick it's a
block i like to use for redstone

924
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
block i like to use for redstone
 

925
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,710
block i like to use for redstone
okay so if there's an item in here

926
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
okay so if there's an item in here
 

927
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,310
okay so if there's an item in here
it will send out a signal to a repeater

928
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
it will send out a signal to a repeater
 

929
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,070
it will send out a signal to a repeater
there's items in take those out

930
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
there's items in take those out
 

931
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,310
there's items in take those out
that goes off unless it picks it up

932
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
that goes off unless it picks it up
 

933
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,669
that goes off unless it picks it up
again because there's so much junk on

934
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
again because there's so much junk on
 

935
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,510
again because there's so much junk on
the ground

936
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
the ground
 

937
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,510
the ground
and i picked it up again

938
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520

 

939
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,830

my inventory is so full okay so there's

940
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
my inventory is so full okay so there's
 

941
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,669
my inventory is so full okay so there's
nothing in that's off

942
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
nothing in that's off
 

943
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,110
nothing in that's off
uh we're going to go to one more

944
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
uh we're going to go to one more
 

945
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,270
uh we're going to go to one more
comparator and this is going to be a

946
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
comparator and this is going to be a
 

947
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,190
comparator and this is going to be a
pulsing one so we switch that to

948
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
pulsing one so we switch that to
 

949
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,750
pulsing one so we switch that to
negative

950
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
negative
 

951
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,310
negative
or subtraction whatever it's called uh

952
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
or subtraction whatever it's called uh
 

953
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,350
or subtraction whatever it's called uh
loop it around

954
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
loop it around
 

955
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,270
loop it around
so now if there's an item in here this

956
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
so now if there's an item in here this
 

957
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,029
so now if there's an item in here this
this clock is going to run

958
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039

 

959
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,070

it does that flashy thing make it come

960
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
it does that flashy thing make it come
 

961
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,549
it does that flashy thing make it come
around if uh if we connect to that

962
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
around if uh if we connect to that
 

963
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,310
around if uh if we connect to that
it connects to that comparator we don't

964
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
it connects to that comparator we don't
 

965
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,470
it connects to that comparator we don't
want that so we're gonna put a

966
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
want that so we're gonna put a
 

967
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,549
want that so we're gonna put a
redstone repeater here at one tick

968
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559

 

969
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,789

and now you see it's it's uh pulsing

970
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
and now you see it's it's uh pulsing
 

971
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,549
and now you see it's it's uh pulsing
like that let's change this with a solid

972
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
like that let's change this with a solid
 

973
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,350
like that let's change this with a solid
block

974
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
block
 

975
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,310
block
that transmits redstone and now if

976
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
that transmits redstone and now if
 

977
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,990
that transmits redstone and now if
there's an item in there it shoots it

978
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
there's an item in there it shoots it
 

979
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,310
there's an item in there it shoots it
out

980
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320

 

981
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,470

into that one by one by one area

982
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
into that one by one by one area
 

983
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,190
into that one by one by one area
that's all good um

984
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200

 

985
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,310

now next part of this

986
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
now next part of this
 

987
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,549
now next part of this
the unloading thing

988
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559

 

989
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,350

let's see how did i do that

990
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
let's see how did i do that
 

991
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,310
let's see how did i do that
this is the same unloading system i set

992
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
this is the same unloading system i set
 

993
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,630
this is the same unloading system i set
up

994
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
up
 

995
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,549
up
in my potion lab where the minecart runs

996
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
in my potion lab where the minecart runs
 

997
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,870
in my potion lab where the minecart runs
over top

998
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880

 

999
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,350

no i might need more guards around here

1000
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
no i might need more guards around here
 

1001
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,630
no i might need more guards around here
i really don't like when yeah shoot

1002
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
i really don't like when yeah shoot
 

1003
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,310
i really don't like when yeah shoot
okay so comparator

1004
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320

 

1005
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,190

that's fine do that up to a redstone

1006
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
that's fine do that up to a redstone
 

1007
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,230
that's fine do that up to a redstone
torch

1008
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
torch
 

1009
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,470
torch
and this goes like that

1010
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480

 

1011
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,029

okay and just on the back we need a

1012
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
okay and just on the back we need a
 

1013
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,909
okay and just on the back we need a
little bit more

1014
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919

 

1015
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,909

um the comparator goes through

1016
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919

 

1017
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,390

i can't see barrier goes through this

1018
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
i can't see barrier goes through this
 

1019
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,270
i can't see barrier goes through this
block

1020
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
block
 

1021
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,510
block
then we're gonna run that like it goes

1022
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
then we're gonna run that like it goes
 

1023
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,110
then we're gonna run that like it goes
through

1024
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
through
 

1025
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,149
through
through here to this side as well and we

1026
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
through here to this side as well and we
 

1027
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,230
through here to this side as well and we
run that up

1028
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
run that up
 

1029
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,510
run that up
to this parts and that's done

1030
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
to this parts and that's done
 

1031
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,070
to this parts and that's done
okay and finally we need to hook

1032
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
okay and finally we need to hook
 

1033
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,070
okay and finally we need to hook
this sticky piston up to this

1034
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
this sticky piston up to this
 

1035
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,830
this sticky piston up to this
i guess we could do that

1036
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840

 

1037
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,190

get that going and then we'll put

1038
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
get that going and then we'll put
 

1039
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,029
get that going and then we'll put
redstone below it

1040
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039

 

1041
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,110

just about done here and then we'll see

1042
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
just about done here and then we'll see
 

1043
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,830
just about done here and then we'll see
it working

1044
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840
it working
 

1045
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,149
it working
um okay so

1046
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
um okay so
 

1047
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,789
um okay so
redstone signal will send downward to

1048
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
redstone signal will send downward to
 

1049
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,470
redstone signal will send downward to
here

1050
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
here
 

1051
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,549
here
i don't do redstone on camera too often

1052
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
i don't do redstone on camera too often
 

1053
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,990
i don't do redstone on camera too often
so this is a

1054
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
so this is a
 

1055
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,350
so this is a
little change um

1056
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
little change um
 

1057
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,750
little change um
i used to do it all the time all right

1058
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
i used to do it all the time all right
 

1059
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,909
i used to do it all the time all right
to the repeater to the block to

1060
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919

 

1061
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,830

i think the pistons all the way over

1062
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
i think the pistons all the way over
 

1063
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,430
i think the pistons all the way over
there

1064
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
there
 

1065
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,750
there
hmm

1066
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760

 

1067
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,789

all right we got to be careful about

1068
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799

 

1069
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,110

this as well

1070
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120

 

1071
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,909

can we no we can't do that um

1072
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919

 

1073
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,430

man it's tricky

1074
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
man it's tricky
 

1075
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,950
man it's tricky
i guess we can just do this right

1076
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960

 

1077
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,630

this is different than what what i set

1078
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
this is different than what what i set
 

1079
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,149
this is different than what what i set
up before i think so that's what's

1080
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
up before i think so that's what's
 

1081
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,590
up before i think so that's what's
throwing me

1082
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
throwing me
 

1083
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,070
throwing me
alright so destroy the track

1084
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
alright so destroy the track
 

1085
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,029
alright so destroy the track
so that should be good now there's eyes

1086
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
so that should be good now there's eyes
 

1087
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,270
so that should be good now there's eyes
and

1088
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
and
 

1089
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,190
and
items in here that distance should go

1090
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
items in here that distance should go
 

1091
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,430
items in here that distance should go
down

1092
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
down
 

1093
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,990
down
shoot them into there then when it's

1094
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
shoot them into there then when it's
 

1095
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,789
shoot them into there then when it's
done it

1096
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
done it
 

1097
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,070
done it
it goes back up like that

1098
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
it goes back up like that
 

1099
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,110
it goes back up like that
gas they're all around to me driving me

1100
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
gas they're all around to me driving me
 

1101
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,990
gas they're all around to me driving me
crazy

1102
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
crazy
 

1103
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,590
crazy
i got the sound way down but

1104
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
i got the sound way down but
 

1105
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,029
i got the sound way down but
it's not helping oh

1106
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039

 

1107
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,830

sniper he nailed you right in the face

1108
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
sniper he nailed you right in the face
 

1109
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,350
sniper he nailed you right in the face
boy

1110
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
boy
 

1111
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,430
boy
you gonna take that yeah

1112
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
you gonna take that yeah
 

1113
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,029
you gonna take that yeah
all right um so i got the item elevator

1114
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
all right um so i got the item elevator
 

1115
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,230
all right um so i got the item elevator
going almost all the way up to the

1116
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
going almost all the way up to the
 

1117
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,909
going almost all the way up to the
ceiling i ran out of box when i was up

1118
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
ceiling i ran out of box when i was up
 

1119
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,190
ceiling i ran out of box when i was up
there

1120
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
there
 

1121
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,909
there
but it's picking up stuff

1122
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
but it's picking up stuff
 

1123
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,510
but it's picking up stuff
good to see missed that one because it

1124
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
good to see missed that one because it
 

1125
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,510
good to see missed that one because it
was on the left side

1126
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
was on the left side
 

1127
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,870
was on the left side
should get it on the return no problem

1128
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
should get it on the return no problem
 

1129
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,470
should get it on the return no problem
yep it's still filling up okay so we're

1130
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
yep it's still filling up okay so we're
 

1131
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,470
yep it's still filling up okay so we're
gonna make that minecart go

1132
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
gonna make that minecart go
 

1133
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,149
gonna make that minecart go
down this track but i just set up this

1134
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
down this track but i just set up this
 

1135
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,830
down this track but i just set up this
temporarily

1136
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
temporarily
 

1137
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,590
temporarily
and there's two different settings for

1138
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
and there's two different settings for
 

1139
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,350
and there's two different settings for
this thing we can have it at

1140
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
this thing we can have it at
 

1141
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,470
this thing we can have it at
four this repeater at four and what

1142
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
four this repeater at four and what
 

1143
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,190
four this repeater at four and what
that'll do

1144
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
that'll do
 

1145
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,789
that'll do
it'll un load it uh sporadically

1146
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
it'll un load it uh sporadically
 

1147
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,990
it'll un load it uh sporadically
it's broad periodically

1148
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
it's broad periodically
 

1149
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,269
it's broad periodically
what's the right word

1150
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279

 

1151
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,870

i can't remember how many does it does

1152
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
i can't remember how many does it does
 

1153
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,750
i can't remember how many does it does
at a time

1154
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
at a time
 

1155
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,909
at a time
i think it's like six

1156
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919

 

1157
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,549

don't don't you dare so it unloads six

1158
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
don't don't you dare so it unloads six
 

1159
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,430
don't don't you dare so it unloads six
at a time

1160
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
at a time
 

1161
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,029
at a time
if you have at that setting or if you

1162
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
if you have at that setting or if you
 

1163
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,830
if you have at that setting or if you
have it at three it unloads the whole

1164
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
have it at three it unloads the whole
 

1165
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,149
have it at three it unloads the whole
thing

1166
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
thing
 

1167
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,230
thing
before the piston retracts again or

1168
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
before the piston retracts again or
 

1169
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,630
before the piston retracts again or
extends or whatever

1170
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640

 

1171
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,750

now it's doing the whole thing and when

1172
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
now it's doing the whole thing and when
 

1173
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,269
now it's doing the whole thing and when
the minecart's done load

1174
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
the minecart's done load
 

1175

the minecart's done load
unloading the the launcher system takes

1176
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
unloading the the launcher system takes
 

1177
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,630
unloading the the launcher system takes
care of sending it back

1178
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640

 

1179
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,909

all on its own so

all on its own so
 

1181
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,990
all on its own so
this is a fully automated minecart

1182
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
this is a fully automated minecart
 

1183
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,350
this is a fully automated minecart

once i make it go all the way and we can

1190
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
once i make it go all the way and we can
 

1191
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,870
once i make it go all the way and we can
make it go as high as i want

1192
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
make it go as high as i want
 

1193
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,870
make it go as high as i want
and then set up hoppers up nice throw

1194
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880

 

1195
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,990

really how did you get up here

1196
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
really how did you get up here

you want to make life tough for me don't

1198
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
you want to make life tough for me don't
 

1199
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,669
you want to make life tough for me don't

dang guy all right so i gotta attach

1204
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
dang guy all right so i gotta attach
 

1205
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,950
dang guy all right so i gotta attach
this to the ceiling

1206
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
this to the ceiling
 

1207
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,630
this to the ceiling
so i gotta fill in all these cracks in

1208
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
so i gotta fill in all these cracks in
 

1209
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,470
so i gotta fill in all these cracks in
the bedrock if i can

1210
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
the bedrock if i can
 

1211
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,630
the bedrock if i can
hopefully that's possible

1212
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640

 

1213
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,950

make sure like all this stuff needs to

1214
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
make sure like all this stuff needs to
 

1215
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,630
make sure like all this stuff needs to
be filled in i don't know why i'm

1216
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
be filled in i don't know why i'm
 

1217
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,470
be filled in i don't know why i'm
hollowing out

1218
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
hollowing out
 

1219
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,710
hollowing out
when it's already filled in should be

1220
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
when it's already filled in should be
 

1221
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,110
when it's already filled in should be
solid

1222
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
solid
 

1223
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,310
solid
yeah i think we're good

1224
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320

 

1225
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,630

okay so i do have a plan here a little

1226
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
okay so i do have a plan here a little
 

1227
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,630
okay so i do have a plan here a little
in-game test we can do to figure out the

1228
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
in-game test we can do to figure out the
 

1229
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,630
in-game test we can do to figure out the
answer that question i had before

1230
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
answer that question i had before
 

1231
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,630
answer that question i had before
what happens to mobs when they go

1232
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
what happens to mobs when they go
 

1233
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,110
what happens to mobs when they go
outside of the 128 block

1234
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
outside of the 128 block
 

1235
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,909
outside of the 128 block
barrier from your player do they

1236
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
barrier from your player do they
 

1237
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,590
barrier from your player do they
instantly despawn like

1238
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
instantly despawn like
 

1239
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,630
instantly despawn like
next frame or does it take a second or

1240
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
next frame or does it take a second or
 

1241
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,510
next frame or does it take a second or
two

1242
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
two
 

1243
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,110
two
what is the the time approximately

1244
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
what is the the time approximately
 

1245
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,190
what is the the time approximately
i can't get it figured out exactly i

1246
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
i can't get it figured out exactly i
 

1247
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,269
i can't get it figured out exactly i
don't think but uh

1248
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
don't think but uh
 

1249
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,510
don't think but uh
i'll know if it's instant or like a

1250
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
i'll know if it's instant or like a
 

1251
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,110
i'll know if it's instant or like a
second or longer

1252
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
second or longer
 

1253
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,590
second or longer
based on this test so we're at y106

1254
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
based on this test so we're at y106
 

1255
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,669
based on this test so we're at y106
the spawning pads for the zombie pigmen

1256
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
the spawning pads for the zombie pigmen
 

1257
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,909
the spawning pads for the zombie pigmen
at the lowest point is right here

1258
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
at the lowest point is right here
 

1259
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,310
at the lowest point is right here
so um if we add 128 to 106

1260
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
so um if we add 128 to 106
 

1261
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,590
so um if we add 128 to 106
i'm gonna go up to i think that's 234.

1262
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
i'm gonna go up to i think that's 234.
 

1263
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,029
i'm gonna go up to i think that's 234.
let's go up to 230 up in the sky

1264
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
let's go up to 230 up in the sky
 

1265
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,990
let's go up to 230 up in the sky
and we'll call this zero barrier right

1266
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000
and we'll call this zero barrier right
 

1267
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,830
and we'll call this zero barrier right
here so

1268
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
here so
 

1269
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,230
here so
once they once they drop off the pads

1270
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
once they once they drop off the pads
 

1271
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,590
once they once they drop off the pads
and start falling

1272
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
and start falling
 

1273
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,190
and start falling
uh they will hit zero

1274
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
uh they will hit zero
 

1275
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,310
uh they will hit zero
i'm saying zero weird i feel they'll hit

1276
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
i'm saying zero weird i feel they'll hit
 

1277
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,870
i'm saying zero weird i feel they'll hit
zero

1278
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
zero
 

1279
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,990
zero
barrier um

1280
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
barrier um
 

1281
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,149
barrier um
and they'll be outside the 128 block

1282
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
and they'll be outside the 128 block
 

1283
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,190
and they'll be outside the 128 block
range and

1284
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
range and
 

1285
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,310
range and
if if they hit the ground the gold is

1286
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
if if they hit the ground the gold is
 

1287
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,909
if if they hit the ground the gold is
gonna come up to the top there so that

1288
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
gonna come up to the top there so that
 

1289
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,190
gonna come up to the top there so that
will mean

1290
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
will mean
 

1291
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,590
will mean
after they leave the 120 block range it

1292
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
after they leave the 120 block range it
 

1293
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,190
after they leave the 120 block range it
takes them a second or

1294
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
takes them a second or
 

1295
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,630
takes them a second or
or more probably because that's about

1296
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
or more probably because that's about
 

1297
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,390
or more probably because that's about
how long it takes them to

1298
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,400
how long it takes them to
 

1299
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,710
how long it takes them to
hit the ground if i get no gold while

1300
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
hit the ground if i get no gold while
 

1301
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,070
hit the ground if i get no gold while
i'm up there that means

1302
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
i'm up there that means
 

1303
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,029
i'm up there that means
they probably despawn instantly which

1304
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
they probably despawn instantly which
 

1305
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,710
they probably despawn instantly which
means my farm

1306
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
means my farm
 

1307
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,110
means my farm
is going to need some adjustments here

1308
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
is going to need some adjustments here
 

1309
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,510
is going to need some adjustments here
because that's going to really affect it

1310
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
because that's going to really affect it
 

1311
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,950
because that's going to really affect it
so let's double check this thing is

1312
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
so let's double check this thing is
 

1313
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,070
so let's double check this thing is
still doing its loops

1314
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080

 

1315
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,510

i have to do a little bit of a messy

1316
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
i have to do a little bit of a messy
 

1317
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,389
i have to do a little bit of a messy
setup there it's still going okay

1318
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
setup there it's still going okay
 

1319
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,470
setup there it's still going okay
i think it's double good

1320
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480

 

1321
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,909

it's about to go

1322
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919

 

1323
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,950

didn't collect anything all right well

1324
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
didn't collect anything all right well
 

1325
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,230
didn't collect anything all right well
we're gonna head on up

1326
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
we're gonna head on up
 

1327
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,310
we're gonna head on up
and we shall figure it out pretty quick

1328
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320

 

1329
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,029

it was darn guys this was a tough shot

1330
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
it was darn guys this was a tough shot
 

1331
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,990
it was darn guys this was a tough shot
to make

1332
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
to make
 

1333
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,070
to make
before and now i got two zombie pigmen

1334
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
