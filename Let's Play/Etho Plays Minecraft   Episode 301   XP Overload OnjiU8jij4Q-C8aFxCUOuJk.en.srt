00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
looks pretty good even with the change
 

73
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,109
looks pretty good even with the change
it's more

00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
it's more
 

75
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,429
it's more
transparent now and the texture looks a

76
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
transparent now and the texture looks a
 

77
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,830
transparent now and the texture looks a
lot smoother

78
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840

so that's cool and i've added in a too

84
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
so that's cool and i've added in a too
 

85
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,749
so that's cool and i've added in a too
high walkway here

86
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
high walkway here
 

87
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,510
high walkway here
as we get closer to where the endermen

88
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
as we get closer to where the endermen
 

89
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,109
as we get closer to where the endermen
are so they

90
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
are so they
 

91
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,429
are so they
they can teleport up to 32 blocks any

92
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
they can teleport up to 32 blocks any
 

93
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,550
they can teleport up to 32 blocks any
direction from themselves so

94
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
direction from themselves so
 

95
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,149
direction from themselves so
if we don't give them a valid spot to

96
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
if we don't give them a valid spot to
 

97
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,709
if we don't give them a valid spot to
teleport

98
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
teleport
 

99
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,830
teleport
32 blocks from that building like they

100
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
32 blocks from that building like they
 

101
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,950
32 blocks from that building like they
won't be able to teleport to this

102
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
won't be able to teleport to this
 

103
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,030
won't be able to teleport to this
walkway because it's only too high

104
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
walkway because it's only too high
 

105
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,109
walkway because it's only too high
and then on top up here there's water so

106
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
and then on top up here there's water so
 

107
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,630
and then on top up here there's water so
they can't teleport to that either so

108
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
they can't teleport to that either so
 

109
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,910
they can't teleport to that either so
they can't get away

110
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
they can't get away
 

111
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,790
they can't get away
onto my walkway here

112
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800

 

113
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,790

but yeah all in all this project is

114
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
but yeah all in all this project is
 

115
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,750
but yeah all in all this project is
crazy it took me over 12 hours i think

116
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
crazy it took me over 12 hours i think
 

117
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,470
crazy it took me over 12 hours i think
just to build it not counting designing

118
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
just to build it not counting designing
 

119
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,869
just to build it not counting designing
and stuff

120
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
and stuff
 

121
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,630
and stuff
and i still have a few guys that come

122
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
and i still have a few guys that come
 

123
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,390
and i still have a few guys that come
out of here if i let them sit for too

124
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
out of here if i let them sit for too
 

125
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,110
out of here if i let them sit for too
long

126
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
long
 

127
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,670
long
not a big deal the tnt will blow them up

128
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
not a big deal the tnt will blow them up
 

129
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,390
not a big deal the tnt will blow them up
even if they're in this middle area

130
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
even if they're in this middle area
 

131
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,150
even if they're in this middle area
but uh let's go up top first

132
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
but uh let's go up top first
 

133
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,589
but uh let's go up top first
i don't know how many layers it is i

134
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
i don't know how many layers it is i
 

135
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,589
i don't know how many layers it is i
didn't count yet so we should count that

136
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
didn't count yet so we should count that
 

137
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,550
didn't count yet so we should count that
too

138
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560

 

139
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,550

let's see so we got the rings here to

140
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
let's see so we got the rings here to
 

141
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,309
let's see so we got the rings here to
keep them from falling out then this is

142
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
keep them from falling out then this is
 

143
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,470
keep them from falling out then this is
where the spawning pads start right over

144
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
where the spawning pads start right over
 

145
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,509
where the spawning pads start right over
there

146
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
there
 

147
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,509
there
got the vines to reset their fall damage

148
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
got the vines to reset their fall damage
 

149
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,670
got the vines to reset their fall damage
i'm wondering i guess we'll just pillar

150
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
i'm wondering i guess we'll just pillar
 

151
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,110
i'm wondering i guess we'll just pillar
up i'll remove this later

152
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120

 

153
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,869

and i'll try ender pearl to the top so

154
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
and i'll try ender pearl to the top so
 

155
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,309
and i'll try ender pearl to the top so
we have to go all the way

156
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319

 

157
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,830

but yeah this thing it seems like it's

158
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
but yeah this thing it seems like it's
 

159
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,910
but yeah this thing it seems like it's
working great

160
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
working great
 

161
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,229
working great
um it usually takes them only

162
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
um it usually takes them only
 

163
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,350
um it usually takes them only
like 10 to 15 seconds to fill up down

164
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
like 10 to 15 seconds to fill up down
 

165
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,229
like 10 to 15 seconds to fill up down
below

166
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
below
 

167
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,830

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
and then you just stand in the middle
 

313
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,309
and then you just stand in the middle
all the xp orbs float towards you

314
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319

 

315
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,909

a lot of stuff going on i think this is

318
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
a lot of stuff going on i think this is
 

319
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,350
a lot of stuff going on i think this is
the xp

320
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
the xp
 

321
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,189
the xp
orb noise maybe

322
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
orb noise maybe
 

323
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,309

352
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
and i find two shots is about all it
 

353
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,950
and i find two shots is about all it
takes to

354
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
takes to
 

355
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,790
takes to
get it up to 30 levels

356
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
get it up to 30 levels
 

357
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,550
get it up to 30 levels
and uh we should probably time it too i

358
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
and uh we should probably time it too i
 

359
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,550
and uh we should probably time it too i
want to see how long it takes them to

360
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
want to see how long it takes them to
 

361
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,909
want to see how long it takes them to
fill up i said 10 or 15 seconds

362
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
fill up i said 10 or 15 seconds
 

363
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,070
fill up i said 10 or 15 seconds
before but i think it might be like 15

364
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
before but i think it might be like 15
 

365
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,230
before but i think it might be like 15

the times i run
 

373
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,430
the times i run
just shy of 30. it's always like 29 and

a half

376
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
a half
 

377
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,629
a half

386
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
made a bunch of books brought them over
 

387
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,750
made a bunch of books brought them over
here

388
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
here
 

389
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,509
here
first book it's my four woo hoo

390
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
first book it's my four woo hoo
 

391

first book it's my four woo hoo
party uh

392
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120

 

393
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,030

uh those xp works actually there those

394
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
uh those xp works actually there those
 

395
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,150
uh those xp works actually there those
are the ones from there

396
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
are the ones from there
 

397
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,190
are the ones from there
they glitch out like that though so this

398
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
they glitch out like that though so this
 

399
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,710
they glitch out like that though so this
thing here i've added this in

400
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
thing here i've added this in
 

401
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,110
thing here i've added this in
as sort of a way of holding the xp orbs

402
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
as sort of a way of holding the xp orbs
 

403
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,990
as sort of a way of holding the xp orbs
as a reserve

404
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
as a reserve
 

405
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,949
as a reserve
so you get the bulk of them over here

406
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959

 

407
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,150

and they're actually in there but they

408
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
and they're actually in there but they
 

409
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,470
and they're actually in there but they
do that little teleport out motion so it

410
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
do that little teleport out motion so it
 

411
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,350
do that little teleport out motion so it
looks like you can get them here

412
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
looks like you can get them here
 

413
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,949
looks like you can get them here
but they're actually not there they're

414
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
but they're actually not there they're
 

415
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,590
but they're actually not there they're
over there so now if i'm ever shy of

416
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
over there so now if i'm ever shy of
 

417
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,470
over there so now if i'm ever shy of
30 levels i can just walk under there

418
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
30 levels i can just walk under there
 

419
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,030
30 levels i can just walk under there
and i'll get what i need

420
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
and i'll get what i need

731
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,470
the tnt had been lower in this
tube like down here the whole thing

732
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
tube like down here the whole thing
 

733
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,550
tube like down here the whole thing
would have went

734
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
would have went
 

735
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,069
would have went
all the way up and would have destroyed

736
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
all the way up and would have destroyed
 

737
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,710
all the way up and would have destroyed
like everything everything below the

738
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
like everything everything below the
 

739
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,990
like everything everything below the

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
like i mean this is water this is where
 

843
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,630
like i mean this is water this is where
it's landing right here

844
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640

 

845
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,390

did i no man it

846
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
did i no man it
 

847
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,870
did i no man it
should it's not falling that far either

848
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
should it's not falling that far either
 

849
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,630
should it's not falling that far either
it's not like it's exploding before it

850
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
it's not like it's exploding before it
 

851
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,270
it's not like it's exploding before it
hits the water

852
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
hits the water
 

853
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,990
hits the water
it just doesn't make sense to me

854
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000

 

855
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,150

i'll have to i guess i gotta get back to

856
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
i'll have to i guess i gotta get back to
 

857
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,909
i'll have to i guess i gotta get back to
the drawing board this is

858
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
the drawing board this is
 

859
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,990
the drawing board this is
uh some some flaw with this design

860
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
uh some some flaw with this design
 

861
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,870
uh some some flaw with this design
and it seems to be happening a lot more

862
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
and it seems to be happening a lot more
 

863
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,789
and it seems to be happening a lot more
often than i would even expect

864
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
often than i would even expect
 

865
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,190
often than i would even expect
compared to how many times i've tested

866
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
compared to how many times i've tested
 

867
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,150
compared to how many times i've tested
this before um

868
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
this before um
 

869
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,350
this before um
hmm all right well

870
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
hmm all right well
 

871
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,789
hmm all right well
that's it for the ender ender for today

872
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
that's it for the ender ender for today
 

873
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,270
that's it for the ender ender for today
i do not have enough quartz to fix it

874
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
i do not have enough quartz to fix it
 

875
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,909
i do not have enough quartz to fix it
again

876
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
again
 

877
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,669
again
so i'm not sure how i could fix it if

878
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
so i'm not sure how i could fix it if
 

879
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,789
so i'm not sure how i could fix it if
that water didn't

880
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
that water didn't
 

881
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,149
that water didn't
do it

882
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159

 

883
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,710

except using something besides a ladder

884
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
except using something besides a ladder
 

885
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,350
except using something besides a ladder
might

886
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
might
 

887
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,470
might
be the issue

888
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480

 

889
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,630

so let's go let's head back to the man

890
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
so let's go let's head back to the man
 

891
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,230
so let's go let's head back to the man
cave and i'll clean up this mess some

892
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
cave and i'll clean up this mess some
 

893
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,310
cave and i'll clean up this mess some
other day

894
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
other day

oh what does that mean for the world

896
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
oh what does that mean for the world
 

897
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,070
oh what does that mean for the world
download though i wanted to release the

898
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
download though i wanted to release the
 

899
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,909

uh now that i got this all done but

902
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280

 

903
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,190

i might delay it one more episode i'm

904
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
i might delay it one more episode i'm
 

905
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,630
i might delay it one more episode i'm
not sure i'll think about it

906
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640

 

907
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,510

okay so i had an idea maybe we can

908
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
okay so i had an idea maybe we can
 

909
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,149
okay so i had an idea maybe we can
troubleshoot this problem together

910
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
troubleshoot this problem together
 

911
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,750
troubleshoot this problem together
i'm in a creative world now this is

912
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
i'm in a creative world now this is
 

913
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,909
i'm in a creative world now this is
where i built the original prototype for

914
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
where i built the original prototype for
 

915
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,789
where i built the original prototype for
it and it looks

916
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
it and it looks
 

917
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,190
it and it looks
it looks pretty much the same there's a

918
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
it looks pretty much the same there's a
 

919
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,990
it looks pretty much the same there's a
few

920
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
few
 

921
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,510
few
subtle differences like different

922
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
subtle differences like different
 

923
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,070
subtle differences like different
spawning pads and stuff in this one

924
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
spawning pads and stuff in this one
 

925
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,070
spawning pads and stuff in this one
compared to when i actually built it in

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
compared to when i actually built it in

my lp world
uh but let's let's trigger the tnt and

930
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
uh but let's let's trigger the tnt and
 

931
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,350
uh but let's let's trigger the tnt and
just

932
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
just
 

933
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,710
just
see if we can spot exactly

934
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
see if we can spot exactly
 

935
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,789
see if we can spot exactly
what it's doing it's fine

936
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
what it's doing it's fine

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,149
what it's doing it's fine
oh i'm gonna have xp in my face

938
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
oh i'm gonna have xp in my face
 

939
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,630
oh i'm gonna have xp in my face
the whole time no

940
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640

 

941
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,390

ah fly up it's good

942
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
ah fly up it's good
 

943
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,549
ah fly up it's good
see it looks like it was kind of off the

944
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
see it looks like it was kind of off the
 

945
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,390
see it looks like it was kind of off the
corner you would think tnt

946
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400

 

947
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,029

explodes in the center of it itself

948
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
explodes in the center of it itself
 

949
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,230
explodes in the center of it itself
though wouldn't you

950
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
though wouldn't you
 

951
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,470
though wouldn't you
i always thought it did maybe it

952
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
i always thought it did maybe it
 

953
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,750
i always thought it did maybe it
explodes in the very

954
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
explodes in the very
 

955
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,710
explodes in the very

957
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,070

oh i think we're out

958
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080

 

959
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,909

i don't know this is very weird i'm not

960
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
i don't know this is very weird i'm not
 

961
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,110
i don't know this is very weird i'm not
shooting two

962
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
shooting two
 

963
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,950
shooting two
that's not the problem either it's not

964
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
that's not the problem either it's not
 

965
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,789
that's not the problem either it's not
like oop

966
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799

 

967
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,909

was that it somehow an

968
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
was that it somehow an
 

969
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,990
was that it somehow an
arrow fire arrow got stuck behind

970
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
arrow fire arrow got stuck behind
 

971
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,430
arrow fire arrow got stuck behind
that was weird

972
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440

 

973
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,430

oh where'd it go

974
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440

 

975
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,029

huh these arrows are doing weird things

976
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
huh these arrows are doing weird things
 

977
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,669
huh these arrows are doing weird things
i'm shooting it and it's not uh

978
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
i'm shooting it and it's not uh
 

979
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,590
i'm shooting it and it's not uh
oh now i'm glitching to the ground what

980
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
oh now i'm glitching to the ground what
 

981
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,430
oh now i'm glitching to the ground what
is going on

982
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
is going on
 

983
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,789
is going on
there we go maybe it's an issue with

984
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
there we go maybe it's an issue with
 

985
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,549
there we go maybe it's an issue with
arrows

986
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559

 

987
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,470

yeah so it got stuck in there

988
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480

 

989
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,669

could the tnt maybe be exploding the

990
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:45,679
could the tnt maybe be exploding the
 

991
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,230
could the tnt maybe be exploding the
fire

992
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
fire
 

993
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,750
fire
fire arrow up one more and two tnt

994
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
fire arrow up one more and two tnt
 

995
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,549
fire arrow up one more and two tnt
are falling from that

996
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559

 

997
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,070

that could be it

998
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080

 

999
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,990

although even that i would be surprised

1000
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
although even that i would be surprised
 

1001
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,510
although even that i would be surprised
if it blew it up

1002
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520

 

1003
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,950

okay so how about this just

1004
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
okay so how about this just
 

1005
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,190
okay so how about this just
let's assume that's what is going on

1006
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
let's assume that's what is going on
 

1007
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,310
let's assume that's what is going on
here i'm gonna light

1008
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
here i'm gonna light
 

1009
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,190
here i'm gonna light
two of these and see if it blows itself

1010
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
two of these and see if it blows itself
 

1011
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,029
two of these and see if it blows itself
up

1012
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
up
 

1013
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,909
up
let's assume a fire arrow is getting

1014
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
let's assume a fire arrow is getting
 

1015
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,990
let's assume a fire arrow is getting
launched up somehow

1016
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000

 

1017
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,149

i bet you that's what it is i think

1018
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
i bet you that's what it is i think
 

1019
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,549
i bet you that's what it is i think
i think that might be it so there the

1020
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
i think that might be it so there the
 

1021
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,149
i think that might be it so there the
fire arrows are getting stuck in the

1022
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
fire arrows are getting stuck in the
 

1023
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,630
fire arrows are getting stuck in the
tube

1024
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
tube
 

1025
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,070
tube
and then the tnt blows it up to the next

1026
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
and then the tnt blows it up to the next
 

1027
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,750
and then the tnt blows it up to the next
piece and two are getting

1028
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
piece and two are getting
 

1029
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,630
piece and two are getting
dropped i bet

1030
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640

 

1031
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,669

aha how do i fix that i don't know

1032
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
aha how do i fix that i don't know
 

1033
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,909
aha how do i fix that i don't know
i'll think about it i guess i pretty

1034
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
i'll think about it i guess i pretty
 

1035
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,750
i'll think about it i guess i pretty
sure that's the problem though

1036
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760

 

1037
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,870

all right so i was thinking about some

1038
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
all right so i was thinking about some
 

1039
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,190
all right so i was thinking about some
more obviously the tnt is not

1040
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
more obviously the tnt is not
 

1041
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,710
more obviously the tnt is not
launching the fire arrows

1042
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
launching the fire arrows
 

1043
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,870
launching the fire arrows
in the tube because it doesn't explode

1044
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
in the tube because it doesn't explode
 

1045
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,830
in the tube because it doesn't explode
in the tube

1046
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
in the tube
 

1047
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,990
in the tube
so what's probably happening is when i

1048
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
so what's probably happening is when i
 

1049
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,390
so what's probably happening is when i
shoot the flame bow

1050
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400

 

1051
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,510

you kidding me what was that

1052
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520

 

1053
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,549

i want to do that again

1054
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559

 

1055
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,750

is it not sticking into i don't even

1056
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
is it not sticking into i don't even
 

1057
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,990
is it not sticking into i don't even
know what's going on anymore

1058
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
know what's going on anymore
 

1059
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,070
know what's going on anymore
i think there's some bugs with arrows or

1060
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
i think there's some bugs with arrows or
 

1061
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,870
i think there's some bugs with arrows or
something going on

1062
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
something going on
 

1063
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,470
something going on
that is so weird it's like it's not

1064
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
that is so weird it's like it's not
 

1065
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,029
that is so weird it's like it's not
sticking sometimes

1066
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
sticking sometimes
 

1067
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,110
sticking sometimes
you're i'm shooting it too hard it's

1068
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
you're i'm shooting it too hard it's
 

1069
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,350
you're i'm shooting it too hard it's
bouncing out

1070
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
bouncing out
 

1071
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,590
bouncing out
um so i think what's happening is when i

1072
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
um so i think what's happening is when i
 

1073
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,070
um so i think what's happening is when i
shoot up sometimes

1074
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
shoot up sometimes
 

1075
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,630
shoot up sometimes
like arrows i believe can move up to

1076
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
like arrows i believe can move up to
 

1077
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,149
like arrows i believe can move up to
four blocks per second

1078
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
four blocks per second
 

1079
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,269
four blocks per second
and i think it's somehow

1080
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
and i think it's somehow
 

1081
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,430
and i think it's somehow
triggering two tnt per shot

1082
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
triggering two tnt per shot
 

1083
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,950
triggering two tnt per shot
but i didn't get a good view of it

1084
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
but i didn't get a good view of it
 

1085
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,549
but i didn't get a good view of it
either time and i wasn't recording

1086
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
either time and i wasn't recording
 

1087
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,350
either time and i wasn't recording
either time

1088
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
either time
 

1089
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,310
either time
so it's really hard to say exactly what

1090
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
so it's really hard to say exactly what
 

1091
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,830
so it's really hard to say exactly what
happened

1092
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
happened
 

1093
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,590
happened
yeah look at that that is so weird

1094
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
yeah look at that that is so weird
 

1095
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,990
yeah look at that that is so weird
um that was like a that was a strong

1096
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
um that was like a that was a strong
 

1097
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,350
um that was like a that was a strong
shot too huh

1098
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
shot too huh
 

1099
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,990
shot too huh
anyway so why are we at the stronghold i

1100
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
anyway so why are we at the stronghold i
 

1101
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,990
anyway so why are we at the stronghold i
just wanted to point something out

1102
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
just wanted to point something out
 

1103
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,269
just wanted to point something out
uh there's been a change in

1104
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
uh there's been a change in
 

1105
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,430
uh there's been a change in
one of the recent snapshots where now

1106
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
one of the recent snapshots where now
 

1107
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,350
one of the recent snapshots where now
witches spawn

1108
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
witches spawn
 

1109
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,269
witches spawn
naturally as i'm sure a lot of you heard

1110
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
naturally as i'm sure a lot of you heard
 

1111
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,350
naturally as i'm sure a lot of you heard
so my mop farm here is getting them

1112
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
so my mop farm here is getting them
 

1113
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,350
so my mop farm here is getting them
they have more oh it's it's nighttime

1114
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
they have more oh it's it's nighttime
 

1115
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,390
they have more oh it's it's nighttime
we're not going to see

1116
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400
we're not going to see
 

1117
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,430
we're not going to see
too good of rates until daytime so let's

1118
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
too good of rates until daytime so let's
 

1119
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,950
too good of rates until daytime so let's
go sleep

1120
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
go sleep
 

1121
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,549
go sleep
they have more health than the other

1122
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
they have more health than the other
 

1123
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,549
they have more health than the other
mobs though so i didn't really plan

1124
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
mobs though so i didn't really plan
 

1125
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,789
mobs though so i didn't really plan
around that with this mob farm

1126
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
around that with this mob farm
 

1127
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,350
around that with this mob farm
so sometimes they fall and they don't

1128
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
so sometimes they fall and they don't
 

1129
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,070
so sometimes they fall and they don't
die but

1130
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
die but
 

1131
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,230
die but
most of the time when they fall they do

1132
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
most of the time when they fall they do
 

1133
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,830
most of the time when they fall they do
it's just the lower level

1134
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
it's just the lower level
 

1135
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,149
it's just the lower level
the lower spawning levels in my giant

1136
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
the lower spawning levels in my giant
 

1137
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,990
the lower spawning levels in my giant
tower there

1138
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,000
tower there
 

1139
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,269
tower there
that they sometimes

1140
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
that they sometimes
 

1141
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,590
that they sometimes
don't fall far enough

1142
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600

 

1143
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,590

we might be able to i think was that one

1144
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
we might be able to i think was that one
 

1145
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,350
we might be able to i think was that one
no that was a zombie

1146
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,360

 

1147
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,789

that makes a weird noise they're hitting

1148
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
that makes a weird noise they're hitting
 

1149
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,110
that makes a weird noise they're hitting
the wooden planks as they fall

1150
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120

 

1151
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,070

come on mobs i think what happens at

1152
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
come on mobs i think what happens at
 

1153
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,230
come on mobs i think what happens at
nighttime a bunch of slime spawn outside

1180
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
i was really excited i thought maybe
 

1181
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,950
i was really excited i thought maybe
because i'm always desperate for

1182
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
because i'm always desperate for
 

1183
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,870
because i'm always desperate for
redstone i thought maybe this is

1184
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
redstone i thought maybe this is
 

1185
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,590
redstone i thought maybe this is
what was gonna do at this change but now

1186
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
what was gonna do at this change but now
 

1187
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,870
what was gonna do at this change but now
it's pretty slow

1188
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
it's pretty slow
 

1189
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,310
it's pretty slow
although it'll it'll help um

1190
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
although it'll it'll help um
 

1191
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,950
although it'll it'll help um
i almost never show it let's go outside

1192
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
i almost never show it let's go outside
 

1193
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,590
i almost never show it let's go outside
uh

1194
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
uh
 

1195
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,190
uh
if there's any new viewers out here and

1196
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
if there's any new viewers out here and
 

1197
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,269
if there's any new viewers out here and
wondering where the mobs are coming from

1198
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279

 

1199
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,750

we are in a swamp biome here this is

1200
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
we are in a swamp biome here this is
 

1201
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,669
we are in a swamp biome here this is
stronghold that i've kind of converted

1202
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
stronghold that i've kind of converted
 

1203
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,190
stronghold that i've kind of converted
into a base

1204
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
into a base
 

1205
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,230
into a base
and above here is a giant spawning tower

1206
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
and above here is a giant spawning tower
 

1207
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,470
and above here is a giant spawning tower
i built

1208
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
i built
 

1209
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,549
i built
all the mobs fall down a single one by

1210
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
all the mobs fall down a single one by
 

1211
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,149
all the mobs fall down a single one by
one hole

1212
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159

 

1213
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,510

all the way down here

1214
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1215
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,549

and it gets pretty decent rates

1216
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
and it gets pretty decent rates
 

1217
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,470
and it gets pretty decent rates
considering there's no pistons involved

1218
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
considering there's no pistons involved
 

1219
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,190
considering there's no pistons involved
it's a pretty good mob farm

1220
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200

 

1221
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,269

oh yeah

1222
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279

 

1223
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,350

that's my jam okay we're back here

1224
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
that's my jam okay we're back here
 

1225
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,190
that's my jam okay we're back here
it's a really good song i like this one

i even turned it down

1238
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
i even turned it down
 

1239
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,789
i even turned it down
oh does it not work

1240
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799

 

1241
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,590

oh yeah it must be glitchy okay anyway

1242
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
oh yeah it must be glitchy okay anyway
 

1243
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,350
oh yeah it must be glitchy okay anyway
uh so i've been doing some stuff around

1244
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
uh so i've been doing some stuff around
 

1245
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,269
uh so i've been doing some stuff around
here this now goes all the way through

1246
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
here this now goes all the way through
 

1247
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,029
here this now goes all the way through
and i put a staircase

1248
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
and i put a staircase
 

1249
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,310
and i put a staircase
uh down i talked about wanting to

1250
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
uh down i talked about wanting to
 

1251
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,590
uh down i talked about wanting to
putting

1252
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
putting
 

1253
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,149
putting
wanting to putting wanting an elevator

1254
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
wanting to putting wanting an elevator
 

1255
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,070
wanting to putting wanting an elevator
here that goes up to the surface

1256
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
here that goes up to the surface
 

1257
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,389
here that goes up to the surface
that i can take the horses up to and

1258
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
that i can take the horses up to and
 

1259
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,789
that i can take the horses up to and
checked it out right above here is the

1260
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
checked it out right above here is the
 

1261
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,149
checked it out right above here is the
river

1262
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
river
 

1263
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,990
river
from uh which river

1264
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000

 

1265
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,029

this river up here um so i wasn't able

1266
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
this river up here um so i wasn't able
 

1267
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,549
this river up here um so i wasn't able
to go straight up there so i decided

1268
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:50,559
to go straight up there so i decided
 

1269
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,909
to go straight up there so i decided
just to make a staircase that goes down

1270
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
just to make a staircase that goes down
 

1271
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,789
just to make a staircase that goes down
and instead i put the piston elevator

1272
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
and instead i put the piston elevator
 

1273
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,430
and instead i put the piston elevator
over here

1274
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
over here
 

1275
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,350
over here
i think this is a good spot for it

1276
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360

 

1277
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,830

it's not done yet though needs some

1278
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
it's not done yet though needs some
 

1279
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,510
it's not done yet though needs some
polishing work but it is functional at

1280
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
polishing work but it is functional at
 

1281
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,950
polishing work but it is functional at
this point

1282
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
this point
 

1283
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,870
this point
uh so let's try it out we'll get a horse

1284
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
uh so let's try it out we'll get a horse
 

1285
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,789
uh so let's try it out we'll get a horse
here

1286
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
here
 

1287
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,070
here
and i got a second chance

1288
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
and i got a second chance
 

1289
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,070
and i got a second chance
there he's in the end now he's like man

1290
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
there he's in the end now he's like man
 

1291
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,590
there he's in the end now he's like man
there's a spot missing

1292
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
there's a spot missing
 

1293
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,590
there's a spot missing
uh this is cool too i i noticed this

1294
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
uh this is cool too i i noticed this
 

1295
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,389
uh this is cool too i i noticed this
today if i go in here

1296
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
today if i go in here
 

1297
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,909
today if i go in here
this is my uh little holding cells

1298
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
this is my uh little holding cells
 

1299
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,830
this is my uh little holding cells
now when i get off the the horses or the

1300
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
now when i get off the the horses or the
 

1301
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,070
now when i get off the the horses or the
donkeys it actually puts me outside

1302
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080
donkeys it actually puts me outside
 

1303
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,950
donkeys it actually puts me outside
which is

1304
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
which is
 

1305
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,350
which is
really cool

1306
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360

 

1307
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,389

kind of unexpected and nice because

1308
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
kind of unexpected and nice because
 

1309
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,190
kind of unexpected and nice because
before

1310
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
before
 

1311
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,029
before
it would drop me off inside here and i'd

1312
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
it would drop me off inside here and i'd
 

1313
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,710
it would drop me off inside here and i'd
have to walk out so it's just a little

1314
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
have to walk out so it's just a little
 

1315
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,669
have to walk out so it's just a little
bit nicer

1316
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
bit nicer
 

1317
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,430
bit nicer
a little more convenient but let's uh

1318
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
a little more convenient but let's uh
 

1319
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,990
a little more convenient but let's uh
let's take this guy i guess

1320
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
let's take this guy i guess
 

1321
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,470
let's take this guy i guess
and check out the elevator here it's

1322
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,480
and check out the elevator here it's
 

1323
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,350
and check out the elevator here it's
just uh

1324
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
just uh
 

1325
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,269
just uh
this is the jeb piston design thing

1326
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
this is the jeb piston design thing
 

1327
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,549
this is the jeb piston design thing
um basically this sticky piston pushes

1328
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
um basically this sticky piston pushes
 

1329
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,310
um basically this sticky piston pushes
this piston out

1330
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
this piston out
 

1331
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,510
this piston out
and then that gets powered from behind

1332
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
and then that gets powered from behind
 

1333
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,310
and then that gets powered from behind
there

1334
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
there
 

1335
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,149
there
and pushes up and they alternate every

1336
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
and pushes up and they alternate every
 

1337
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:17,510
and pushes up and they alternate every
redstone tick

1338
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520

 

1339
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,750

that's pretty cool uh i don't have a way

1340
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
that's pretty cool uh i don't have a way
 

1341
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,110
that's pretty cool uh i don't have a way
of jumping down yet so i have to take

1342
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
of jumping down yet so i have to take
 

1343
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,110
of jumping down yet so i have to take
the long route

1344
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
the long route
 

1345
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,590
the long route
and i'm still working out how to make it

1346
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
and i'm still working out how to make it
 

1347
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,350
and i'm still working out how to make it
work for a player it does work for

1348
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
work for a player it does work for
 

1349
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,990
work for a player it does work for
players

1350
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
players
 

1351
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,630
players
too but it's you gotta get your position

1352
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
too but it's you gotta get your position
 

1353
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,110
too but it's you gotta get your position
just

1354
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
just
 

1355
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,909
just
right some people they like to put

1356
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
right some people they like to put
 

1357
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,750
right some people they like to put
fences on both sides but then i wouldn't

1358
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,760
fences on both sides but then i wouldn't
 

1359
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,430
fences on both sides but then i wouldn't
be able to get

1360
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
be able to get
 

1361
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,190
be able to get
the horse through

1362
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200

 

1363
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,110

so i just kind of have to guess where

1364
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
so i just kind of have to guess where
 

1365
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,590
so i just kind of have to guess where
the middle is

1366
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600

 

1367
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,669

alright so let's go back down

1368
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
alright so let's go back down
 

1369
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,029
alright so let's go back down
here i'll try ride it so if the best way

1370
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
here i'll try ride it so if the best way
 

1371
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,630
here i'll try ride it so if the best way
seems to be to stand in the middle

1372
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640

 

1373
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,990

all right so i had to jump at the end

1374
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
all right so i had to jump at the end
 

1375
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,909
all right so i had to jump at the end
there i don't think i can just walk out

1376
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
there i don't think i can just walk out
 

1377
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,590
there i don't think i can just walk out
with the way i have it set up if i

1378
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
with the way i have it set up if i
 

1379
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,269
with the way i have it set up if i
change these to half slabs

1380
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
change these to half slabs
 

1381
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,990
change these to half slabs
or added a piston that pushes me forward

1382
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
or added a piston that pushes me forward
 

1383
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,230
or added a piston that pushes me forward
should work out just fine

1384
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
should work out just fine
 

1385
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,190
should work out just fine

1391
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,590
trying to walk forward that time didn't
work out too well

1392
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600

time
 

1479
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,789
time
instead of having a whole chamber of

1480
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
instead of having a whole chamber of
 

1481
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,310
instead of having a whole chamber of
them and that should work no problem

1482
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
them and that should work no problem
