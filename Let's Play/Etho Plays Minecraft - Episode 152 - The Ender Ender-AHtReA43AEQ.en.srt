wool I got like the look of it
 

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,569
wool I got like the look of it
I tried green wool and it was had too

I tried green wool and it was had too
 

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,470
I tried green wool and it was had too
much contrast it's really stood out so I

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
much contrast it's really stood out so I
 

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,910
much contrast it's really stood out so I
tried orange and I think I'm going to

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
tried orange and I think I'm going to
 

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,799
tried orange and I think I'm going to
keep orange I might just for looks

24
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:44,809
keep orange I might just for looks
 

25
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,069
keep orange I might just for looks
change this inner ring with orange and

26
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
change this inner ring with orange and
 

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,979
change this inner ring with orange and
then the very outer one with orange - I

28
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:51,989
then the very outer one with orange - I
 

29
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,910
then the very outer one with orange - I
think that might look cool but no

30
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
think that might look cool but no
 

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,880
think that might look cool but no
urgency on that so it seems to be

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:58,890
urgency on that so it seems to be
 

33
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,440
urgency on that so it seems to be
functioning really well yeah getting

34
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,450
functioning really well yeah getting
 

35
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,609
functioning really well yeah getting
good rates I added it up today and just

36
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:10,619
good rates I added it up today and just
 

37
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,510
good rates I added it up today and just
the second let me check my calculator

38
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
the second let me check my calculator
 

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,609
the second let me check my calculator
432 spawning spaces so that's that's

40
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,619
432 spawning spaces so that's that's
 

41
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,160
432 spawning spaces so that's that's
good it's not a thousand like I wanted

42
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,170
good it's not a thousand like I wanted
 

43
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,899
good it's not a thousand like I wanted
but it's it's not bad I think I'll

44
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:22,909
but it's it's not bad I think I'll
 

45
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,480
but it's it's not bad I think I'll
probably keep it at that possibly make

46
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,490
probably keep it at that possibly make
 

47
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,050
probably keep it at that possibly make
it one more ring yet but this seems

48
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,060
it one more ring yet but this seems
 

49
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,359
it one more ring yet but this seems
pretty good and I thought about it a bit

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,369
pretty good and I thought about it a bit
 

51
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,899
pretty good and I thought about it a bit
more too and I talked about maybe making

52
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:38,909
more too and I talked about maybe making
 

53
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,700
more too and I talked about maybe making
this into an optional XP farm or have

54
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,710
this into an optional XP farm or have
 

55
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,319
this into an optional XP farm or have
them Auto kill from falling further by

56
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,329
them Auto kill from falling further by
 

57
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,550
them Auto kill from falling further by
raising and lowering blocks with pistons

58
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,560
raising and lowering blocks with pistons
 

59
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,990
raising and lowering blocks with pistons
not going to bother with that I'm just

60
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
not going to bother with that I'm just
 

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,410
not going to bother with that I'm just
going to make it into a straight XP farm

62
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,420
going to make it into a straight XP farm
 

63
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,840
going to make it into a straight XP farm
and nothing more

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:01:59,850
and nothing more
 

65
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,330
and nothing more
because I can't really see myself just

66
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,340
because I can't really see myself just
 

67
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,539
because I can't really see myself just
sitting around here trying to gather

68
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:04,549
sitting around here trying to gather
 

69
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,340
sitting around here trying to gather
ender pearls I get so many of them as it

70
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,350
ender pearls I get so many of them as it
 

71
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,430
ender pearls I get so many of them as it
is I don't need to wait around for more

72
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
is I don't need to wait around for more
 

73
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,630
is I don't need to wait around for more
I got

74
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
I got
 

75
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,210
I got
I think three or four double chests full

76
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,220
I think three or four double chests full
 

77
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,210
I think three or four double chests full
now and I just barely finished this so

78
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,220
now and I just barely finished this so
 

79
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,010
now and I just barely finished this so
that's what we're going to do I have to

80
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,020
that's what we're going to do I have to
 

81
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,230
that's what we're going to do I have to
raise this up one block that means that

82
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,240
raise this up one block that means that
 

83
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,930
raise this up one block that means that
whole area that I have outlined that's

84
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:27,940
whole area that I have outlined that's
 

85
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,820
whole area that I have outlined that's
about a 40 by 40 square so I thought a

86
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:32,830
about a 40 by 40 square so I thought a
 

87
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,710
about a 40 by 40 square so I thought a
quick way of maybe raising it would just

88
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
quick way of maybe raising it would just
 

89
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,460
quick way of maybe raising it would just
be to flood it all with water and then

90
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,470
be to flood it all with water and then
 

91
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,100
be to flood it all with water and then
pour live over top to make smooth stone

92
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,110
pour live over top to make smooth stone
 

93
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,390
pour live over top to make smooth stone
so that's what I'm going to try here and

94
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
so that's what I'm going to try here and
 

95
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,320
so that's what I'm going to try here and
another nice thing about doing it that

96
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,330
another nice thing about doing it that
 

97
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,030
another nice thing about doing it that
way is it will get rid of all the

98
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
way is it will get rid of all the
 

99
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,280
way is it will get rid of all the
torches really easily so here I go

100
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,290

 

101
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,280

all right I got it flooded now I put

102
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,290
all right I got it flooded now I put
 

103
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,100
all right I got it flooded now I put
water along this side and that side and

104
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,110
water along this side and that side and
 

105
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,810
water along this side and that side and
that only took me about two minutes or

106
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:03,820
that only took me about two minutes or
 

107
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,240
that only took me about two minutes or
so which isn't bad for 40 by 40 area and

108
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,250
so which isn't bad for 40 by 40 area and
 

109
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,100
so which isn't bad for 40 by 40 area and
I added that up and that's about 25

110
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,110
I added that up and that's about 25
 

111
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,250
I added that up and that's about 25
stacks cobble you would need to to fill

112
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,260
stacks cobble you would need to to fill
 

113
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,890
stacks cobble you would need to to fill
this all in one block high which is a

114
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:19,900
this all in one block high which is a
 

115
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,990
this all in one block high which is a
lot these guys if they fall down all

116
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
lot these guys if they fall down all
 

117
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,030
lot these guys if they fall down all
that way and as soon as they touch the

118
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
that way and as soon as they touch the
 

119
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,650
that way and as soon as they touch the
water they teleport and they have full

120
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:28,660
water they teleport and they have full
 

121
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,590
water they teleport and they have full
health - the water damage so all those

122
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:34,600
health - the water damage so all those
 

123
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,150
health - the water damage so all those
guys pretty much have full health in

124
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,160
guys pretty much have full health in
 

125
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,080
guys pretty much have full health in
front of me so keep that in mind if

126
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,090
front of me so keep that in mind if
 

127
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,060
front of me so keep that in mind if
you're playing or messing around with

128
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,070
you're playing or messing around with
 

129
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,850
you're playing or messing around with
these guys they teleport instantly when

130
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:44,860
these guys they teleport instantly when
 

131
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,509
these guys they teleport instantly when
they touch water and here we go this is

132
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:48,519
they touch water and here we go this is
 

133
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,620
they touch water and here we go this is
what I was waiting to do I love doing

134
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,630
what I was waiting to do I love doing
 

135
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,470
what I was waiting to do I love doing
that oh yeah

136
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480

 

137
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,430

let's getting them all that's so cool

138
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,440
let's getting them all that's so cool
 

139
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,970
let's getting them all that's so cool
all right so we got it all flooded now

140
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:13,980
all right so we got it all flooded now
 

141
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,880
all right so we got it all flooded now
Chain Reaction flooding now we got to

142
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:17,890
Chain Reaction flooding now we got to
 

143
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,380
Chain Reaction flooding now we got to
put lava on top

144
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,390
put lava on top
 

145
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,890
put lava on top
these guys are having a bad day I don't

146
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:23,900
these guys are having a bad day I don't
 

147
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,360
these guys are having a bad day I don't
know how this is going to work out and

148
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,370
know how this is going to work out and
 

149
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,400
know how this is going to work out and
it'll probably I'm guessing it'll take a

150
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,410
it'll probably I'm guessing it'll take a
 

151
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,590
it'll probably I'm guessing it'll take a
long time for the lava to disappear I

152
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
long time for the lava to disappear I
 

153
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,700
long time for the lava to disappear I
should probably start at this is freaky

154
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,710

 

155
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,080

probably start at one end and I'm

156
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,090
probably start at one end and I'm
 

157
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,810
probably start at one end and I'm
working my way back to the other and I

158
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:43,820
working my way back to the other and I
 

159
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,340
working my way back to the other and I
don't think don't think I put it

160
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,350
don't think don't think I put it
 

161
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,680
don't think don't think I put it
directly on the water so I'll have to

162
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,690
directly on the water so I'll have to
 

163
00:04:47,690 --> 00:05:00,190
directly on the water so I'll have to
put and how about you this MA better

164
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,200
put and how about you this MA better
 

165
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,660
put and how about you this MA better
turns down a bit more just to start it I

166
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:04,670
turns down a bit more just to start it I
 

167
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,690
turns down a bit more just to start it I
need something to put it on oh let's see

168
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:10,700
need something to put it on oh let's see
 

169
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:20,920
need something to put it on oh let's see
I guess all I'll do one of these oh yeah

170
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:20,930
I guess all I'll do one of these oh yeah
 

171
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:30,360
I guess all I'll do one of these oh yeah
that's fine spread spreading yeah good I

172
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,370
that's fine spread spreading yeah good I
 

173
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,790
that's fine spread spreading yeah good I
got to do that all the way long that'll

174
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
got to do that all the way long that'll
 

175
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,830
got to do that all the way long that'll
replace all the water with

176
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
replace all the water with
 

177
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,060
replace all the water with
it's milestone I actually don't have a

178
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,070
it's milestone I actually don't have a
 

179
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,920
it's milestone I actually don't have a
whole lot of cobble to waste on this

180
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:48,930
whole lot of cobble to waste on this
 

181
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,340
whole lot of cobble to waste on this
kind of stuff I used a lot building this

182
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,350
kind of stuff I used a lot building this
 

183
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,580
kind of stuff I used a lot building this
this bottom platform and all the all the

184
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:55,590
this bottom platform and all the all the
 

185
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,980
this bottom platform and all the all the
pistons I use down there they take quite

186
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:57,990
pistons I use down there they take quite
 

187
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,980
pistons I use down there they take quite
a bit of cobble too so I don't have a

188
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:00,990
a bit of cobble too so I don't have a
 

189
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,409
a bit of cobble too so I don't have a
ton for waste but I guess I got to do

190
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
ton for waste but I guess I got to do
 

191
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,400
ton for waste but I guess I got to do
this for a while here so I'll see you in

192
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,410
this for a while here so I'll see you in
 

193
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,200
this for a while here so I'll see you in
quite a few minutes once I get this all

194
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,210
quite a few minutes once I get this all
 

195
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,920
quite a few minutes once I get this all
done so I'm getting close to about half

196
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:18,930
done so I'm getting close to about half
 

197
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,860
done so I'm getting close to about half
ways done filling this place up it's

198
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:21,870
ways done filling this place up it's
 

199
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,080
ways done filling this place up it's
going to take the lava a long time to

200
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,090
going to take the lava a long time to
 

201
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,460
going to take the lava a long time to
disperse when I've done this but it

202
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,470
disperse when I've done this but it
 

203
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,490
disperse when I've done this but it
seems to seems to be working okay I got

204
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,500
seems to seems to be working okay I got
 

205
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,620
seems to seems to be working okay I got
that pretty decent pattern going I'm

206
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:33,630
that pretty decent pattern going I'm
 

207
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,400
that pretty decent pattern going I'm
just juggling two lava sources to give

208
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,410
just juggling two lava sources to give
 

209
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,490
just juggling two lava sources to give
them time to spread that's the main

210
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,500
them time to spread that's the main
 

211
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,870
them time to spread that's the main
thing of slowing this down as lava

212
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
thing of slowing this down as lava
 

213
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,940
thing of slowing this down as lava
spreads so slow but you're just kind of

214
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:48,950
spreads so slow but you're just kind of
 

215
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,490
spreads so slow but you're just kind of
going along as curious to see how how

216
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,500
going along as curious to see how how
 

217
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,950
going along as curious to see how how
quick this would be and it's pretty

218
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
quick this would be and it's pretty
 

219
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,969
quick this would be and it's pretty
decent I think it's comparable to the

220
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:57,979
decent I think it's comparable to the
 

221
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:59,900
decent I think it's comparable to the
amount of time it takes you to actually

222
00:06:59,900 --> 00:06:59,910
amount of time it takes you to actually
 

223
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,219
amount of time it takes you to actually
place the blocks but it's definitely

224
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:04,229
place the blocks but it's definitely
 

225
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,400
place the blocks but it's definitely
faster than the time okay it takes to

226
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,410
faster than the time okay it takes to
 

227
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,070
faster than the time okay it takes to
mine the blocks cart them here and then

228
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
mine the blocks cart them here and then
 

229
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
mine the blocks cart them here and then
play some hoops not date okay I can't do

230
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,090
play some hoops not date okay I can't do
 

231
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,350
play some hoops not date okay I can't do
that again I did that once already and

232
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
that again I did that once already and
 

233
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,700
that again I did that once already and
I'm down to my last two lava which I

234
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
I'm down to my last two lava which I
 

235
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,469
I'm down to my last two lava which I
need so you could do this like if you

236
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
need so you could do this like if you
 

237
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,580
need so you could do this like if you
need to convert an ocean around your

238
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,590
need to convert an ocean around your
 

239
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,860
need to convert an ocean around your
area into land like you don't want the

240
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:33,870
area into land like you don't want the
 

241
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,320
area into land like you don't want the
ocean there you could do you could do

242
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,330
ocean there you could do you could do
 

243
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,000
ocean there you could do you could do
this get rid of it pretty easily

244
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,010
this get rid of it pretty easily
 

245
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,920
this get rid of it pretty easily
and pretty quickly it's pretty fun

246
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:44,930
and pretty quickly it's pretty fun
 

247
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,730
and pretty quickly it's pretty fun
watching the Enderman die I got to say

248
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:47,740
watching the Enderman die I got to say
 

249
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,810
watching the Enderman die I got to say
it's my favorite part of this whole

250
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:49,820
it's my favorite part of this whole
 

251
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,660
it's my favorite part of this whole
thing but anyway I'm going to continue

252
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:55,670
thing but anyway I'm going to continue
 

253
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,570
thing but anyway I'm going to continue
and I'll let you see it when I'm all

254
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:58,580
and I'll let you see it when I'm all
 

255
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,540
and I'll let you see it when I'm all
done here

256
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,550

 

257
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,880

so I got it all finished I think it took

258
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:06,890
so I got it all finished I think it took
 

259
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,450
so I got it all finished I think it took
me maybe 20 to 30 minutes to do which

260
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,460
me maybe 20 to 30 minutes to do which
 

261
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,310
me maybe 20 to 30 minutes to do which
isn't bad for 1,600 blocks that's that's

262
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,320
isn't bad for 1,600 blocks that's that's
 

263
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,970
isn't bad for 1,600 blocks that's that's
pretty good time lava seems to be

264
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:18,980
pretty good time lava seems to be
 

265
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,610
pretty good time lava seems to be
disappearing pretty quick to take

266
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:21,620
disappearing pretty quick to take
 

267
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,920
disappearing pretty quick to take
another 5 10 minutes it'll all be gone

268
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:23,930
another 5 10 minutes it'll all be gone
 

269
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,100
another 5 10 minutes it'll all be gone
and I only spilled in two areas over the

270
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,110
and I only spilled in two areas over the
 

271
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,960
and I only spilled in two areas over the
edge which is not bad

272
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:28,970
edge which is not bad
 

273
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,170
edge which is not bad
I was pretty careful there is a few

274
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,180
I was pretty careful there is a few
 

275
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,540
I was pretty careful there is a few
water spots left though that I need to

276
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,550
water spots left though that I need to
 

277
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:40,780
water spots left though that I need to
fill in and now all the guys that land

278
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:40,790
fill in and now all the guys that land
 

279
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,480
fill in and now all the guys that land
on this pad will be one hit one hit

280
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,490
on this pad will be one hit one hit
 

281
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:51,670
on this pad will be one hit one hit
wonders it's good yeah so I can move on

282
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
wonders it's good yeah so I can move on
 

283
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,400
wonders it's good yeah so I can move on
to the next stage I have a pretty good

284
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,410
to the next stage I have a pretty good
 

285
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,650
to the next stage I have a pretty good
idea for how I want to do this

286
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:56,660
idea for how I want to do this
 

287
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,640
idea for how I want to do this
Enderman farm now which we will probably

288
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:00,650
Enderman farm now which we will probably
 

289
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,080
Enderman farm now which we will probably
be able to try out today I'm going to

290
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,090
be able to try out today I'm going to
 

291
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:11,800
be able to try out today I'm going to
build a a fence area I think where I

292
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,810
build a a fence area I think where I
 

293
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,360
build a a fence area I think where I
have outlined all around here I'm going

294
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,370
have outlined all around here I'm going
 

295
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:21,490
have outlined all around here I'm going
to put a fence that is like this all the

296
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,500
to put a fence that is like this all the
 

297
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,090
to put a fence that is like this all the
way around this square and I'll be able

298
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,100
way around this square and I'll be able
 

299
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,620
way around this square and I'll be able
to pass through it but they won't be

300
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,630
to pass through it but they won't be
 

301
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,930
to pass through it but they won't be
able to pass through it to get me and

302
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:30,940
able to pass through it to get me and
 

303
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,000
able to pass through it to get me and
then oh I did spill a few more places

304
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,010
then oh I did spill a few more places
 

305
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,770
then oh I did spill a few more places
and then we will hook up the our

306
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:37,780
and then we will hook up the our
 

307
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,690
and then we will hook up the our
automatic system for hopefully

308
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:40,700
automatic system for hopefully
 

309
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,990
automatic system for hopefully
harvesting them we'll see if it works I

310
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,000
harvesting them we'll see if it works I
 

311
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,810
harvesting them we'll see if it works I
have a feeling it will though so if it

312
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:46,820
have a feeling it will though so if it
 

313
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,030
have a feeling it will though so if it
does this farm is going to be absolutely

314
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
does this farm is going to be absolutely
 

315
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,780
does this farm is going to be absolutely
awesome

316
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:52,790

 

317
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,040

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,510
thing won't do you spawn because as is
right now standing where I am the ones

640
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
right now standing where I am the ones
 

641
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,060
right now standing where I am the ones
in the left and right back corners there

642
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,070
in the left and right back corners there
 

643
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,600
in the left and right back corners there
will be spawn because it's it's a

644
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:07,610
will be spawn because it's it's a
 

645
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,380
will be spawn because it's it's a
40-block square the mobs despawn if

646
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,390
40-block square the mobs despawn if
 

647
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,330
40-block square the mobs despawn if
they're 32 blocks away from you they can

648
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,340

 

649
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,669

so I'm gonna try that out I'm going to

650
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:20,679
so I'm gonna try that out I'm going to
 

651
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,060
so I'm gonna try that out I'm going to
set up in the center and see how it goes

652
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,070
set up in the center and see how it goes
 

653
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,359
set up in the center and see how it goes
it might the only problem about setting

654
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:27,369
it might the only problem about setting
 

655
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,600
it might the only problem about setting
up in the center is you have to do of

656
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,610
up in the center is you have to do of
 

657
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,930
up in the center is you have to do of
360 range of motion to get them all but

658
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:35,940
360 range of motion to get them all but
 

659
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,330
360 range of motion to get them all but
over here it's more like a 180 okay I

660
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,340
over here it's more like a 180 okay I
 

661
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,279
over here it's more like a 180 okay I
did something a little bit different

662
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:44,289
did something a little bit different
 

663
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,440
did something a little bit different
here I put half slabs on the ground and

664
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,450
here I put half slabs on the ground and
 

665
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,979
here I put half slabs on the ground and
made this three high I definitely don't

666
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:49,989
made this three high I definitely don't
 

667
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,830
made this three high I definitely don't
recommend that they can actually

668
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
recommend that they can actually
 

669
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,029
recommend that they can actually
teleport to where I'm standing and get

670
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:54,039
teleport to where I'm standing and get
 

671
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,930
teleport to where I'm standing and get
me they also do this weird thing for

672
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:57,940
me they also do this weird thing for
 

673
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,820
me they also do this weird thing for
some reason where they teleport away

674
00:21:59,820 --> 00:21:59,830
some reason where they teleport away
 

675
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:13,279
some reason where they teleport away
when I look at them say humans got me

676
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:13,289

 

677
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:16,560

yeah so I'm gonna make this to hide get

678
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,570
yeah so I'm gonna make this to hide get
 

679
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,820
yeah so I'm gonna make this to hide get
rid of the Hat slab but we'll see if

680
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:17,830
rid of the Hat slab but we'll see if
 

681
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,649
rid of the Hat slab but we'll see if
it's any different all right let's try

682
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:22,659
it's any different all right let's try
 

683
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:24,840
it's any different all right let's try
this again this is two box high like we

684
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:24,850
this again this is two box high like we
 

685
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,119
this again this is two box high like we
had around that outside there that's a

686
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,129
had around that outside there that's a
 

687
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:31,169
had around that outside there that's a
fence I should be safe and hopefully

688
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:31,179
fence I should be safe and hopefully
 

689
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,409
fence I should be safe and hopefully
they don't do that teleport away thing

690
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:33,419
they don't do that teleport away thing
 

691
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,879
they don't do that teleport away thing
the advantage of being in the center

692
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:35,889
the advantage of being in the center
 

693
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,700
the advantage of being in the center
here is that it should be easier to look

694
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,710
here is that it should be easier to look
 

695
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,239
here is that it should be easier to look
at them I would think it makes a big

696
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:45,249
at them I would think it makes a big
 

697
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:52,950
at them I would think it makes a big
difference if you go slow almost like

698
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
difference if you go slow almost like
 

699
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,629
difference if you go slow almost like
you have to look at them for like a

700
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:54,639
you have to look at them for like a
 

701
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:00,149
you have to look at them for like a
split second before they will get mad at

702
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
split second before they will get mad at
 

703
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,450
split second before they will get mad at
you

704
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,460

 

705
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,080

maybe I don't know if you just do this

706
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,090
maybe I don't know if you just do this
 

707
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,210
maybe I don't know if you just do this
like really quick you might get the odd

708
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:12,220
like really quick you might get the odd
 

709
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,020
like really quick you might get the odd
one but generally they don't get mad at

710
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,030
one but generally they don't get mad at
 

711
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,110
one but generally they don't get mad at
you unless you go slow and pretty much

712
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,120
you unless you go slow and pretty much
 

713
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,210
you unless you go slow and pretty much
any every single one it's managing to

714
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,220
any every single one it's managing to
 

715
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:33,120
any every single one it's managing to
deal with that I seems like doing it on

716
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,130
deal with that I seems like doing it on
 

717
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,950
deal with that I seems like doing it on
the edge it's a little easier to get

718
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
the edge it's a little easier to get
 

719
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:53,930
the edge it's a little easier to get
them together though a little smaller

720
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:53,940

 

721
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,340

yeah I think I like the edge more just

722
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,350
yeah I think I like the edge more just
 

723
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,460
yeah I think I like the edge more just
because of the 180 mu 360 here makes it

724
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,470
because of the 180 mu 360 here makes it
 

725
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:07,290
because of the 180 mu 360 here makes it
more difficult to lick them all let's go

726
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:07,300
more difficult to lick them all let's go
 

727
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,100
more difficult to lick them all let's go
a little bit smaller yet oh just a

728
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,110
a little bit smaller yet oh just a
 

729
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,670
a little bit smaller yet oh just a
little bit see if we're still safe

730
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:14,680
little bit see if we're still safe
 

731
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,850
little bit see if we're still safe
now it's only a two by two protection I

732
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:17,860
now it's only a two by two protection I
 

733
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,230
now it's only a two by two protection I
have here very good something looks like

734
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
have here very good something looks like
 

735
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,130
have here very good something looks like
we're going to be able to do another

736
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,140
we're going to be able to do another
 

737
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,500
we're going to be able to do another
enchantment I'll probably I'm guessing

738
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,510
enchantment I'll probably I'm guessing
 

739
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,940
enchantment I'll probably I'm guessing
I'm gonna be enchanting a lot of stuff

740
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:29,950
I'm gonna be enchanting a lot of stuff
 

741
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm gonna be enchanting a lot of stuff
between this episode in the next one so

742
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:32,770
between this episode in the next one so
 

743
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,780
between this episode in the next one so
I'll probably want to play with this

744
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:33,790
I'll probably want to play with this
 

745
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:41,350
I'll probably want to play with this
quite a bit

746
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360

 

747
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:50,090

slow yeah I like it on the edge all

748
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,100
slow yeah I like it on the edge all
 

749
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,250
slow yeah I like it on the edge all
right well I guess I'm going to head

750
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,260
right well I guess I'm going to head
 

751
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,680
right well I guess I'm going to head
back we'll do an enchantment walks I'm

752
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:54,690
back we'll do an enchantment walks I'm
 

753
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,500
back we'll do an enchantment walks I'm
15 and in second gear there we go and

754
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:00,510
15 and in second gear there we go and
 

755
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,980
15 and in second gear there we go and
that will be the wraps for today so

756
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:03,990
that will be the wraps for today so
 

757
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:11,420
that will be the wraps for today so
let's head back and here we go and do an

758
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,430
let's head back and here we go and do an
 

759
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,480
let's head back and here we go and do an
axe I was thinking of maybe enchanting

760
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,490
axe I was thinking of maybe enchanting
 

761
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,520
axe I was thinking of maybe enchanting
some diamond shoes but like to try get

762
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,530
some diamond shoes but like to try get
 

763
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,880
some diamond shoes but like to try get
feather falling because I heard that

764
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:21,890
feather falling because I heard that
 

765
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,710
feather falling because I heard that
ender pearls don't causes much damage if

766
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
ender pearls don't causes much damage if
 

767
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,650
ender pearls don't causes much damage if
you have feather falling or protection

768
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:27,660
you have feather falling or protection
 

769
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,920
you have feather falling or protection
on your armor so that would be very nice

770
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:30,930
on your armor so that would be very nice
 

771
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,600
on your armor so that would be very nice
but I just you only need to do like a

772
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,610
but I just you only need to do like a
 

773
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,620
but I just you only need to do like a
level 20 or 22 enchantment on the boots

774
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:36,630
level 20 or 22 enchantment on the boots
 

775
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,350
level 20 or 22 enchantment on the boots
to have a high probability of getting it

776
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
to have a high probability of getting it
 

777
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,770
to have a high probability of getting it
so I'm going to use the 50 levels on

778
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:42,780
so I'm going to use the 50 levels on
 

779
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,520
so I'm going to use the 50 levels on
extra place when we lost and here we go

780
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,530
extra place when we lost and here we go
 

781
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:55,340
extra place when we lost and here we go
ah that's so sad so very sad well on a
