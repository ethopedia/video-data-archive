00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:24,749

 

169
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:33,780

something like that and pretend this

170
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:33,790
something like that and pretend this
 

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:44,710
something like that and pretend this
block in the corner is a dispenser too

172
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720

 

173
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,230

so if if the dispensers have a

174
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
so if if the dispensers have a
 

175
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,020
so if if the dispensers have a
cobblestone in I'll have a cobblestone

176
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,030
cobblestone in I'll have a cobblestone
 

177
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,470
cobblestone in I'll have a cobblestone
block in the middle and they'll be eight

178
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
block in the middle and they'll be eight
 

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,770
block in the middle and they'll be eight
dispensers around then I plan on setting

180
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:00,780
dispensers around then I plan on setting
 

181
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:13,210
dispensers around then I plan on setting
up a pressure plate probably a stone one

182
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,220

 

183
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,260

in front of the dispenser is probably

184
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,270
in front of the dispenser is probably
 

185
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:24,980
in front of the dispenser is probably
like here and then I'm going to wire

186
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:24,990
like here and then I'm going to wire
 

187
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:52,280
like here and then I'm going to wire
underneath like so for things that don't

188
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,290
underneath like so for things that don't
 

189
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,920
underneath like so for things that don't
stack like meet Matt I'll just be using

190
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:54,930
stack like meet Matt I'll just be using
 

191
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:13,180
stack like meet Matt I'll just be using
one dispenser instead of a single bait

192
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,190

 

193
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,700

specially J and that is going to connect

194
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:19,710
specially J and that is going to connect
 

195
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:38,200
specially J and that is going to connect
I haven't figured this out exactly yet

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,210

 

197
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:44,740

so over here we need a redstone dust I

198
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,750
so over here we need a redstone dust I
 

199
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,010
so over here we need a redstone dust I
think here a block there another dust on

200
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,020
think here a block there another dust on
 

201
00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:00,230
think here a block there another dust on
top like that and then we're going to

202
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
top like that and then we're going to
 

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,559
top like that and then we're going to
put in and heat

204
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:08,569

 

205
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:28,989

output here and light the dust on top -

206
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:28,999

 

207
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:33,109

okay pressure plate is going to light up

208
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:33,119
okay pressure plate is going to light up
 

209
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:43,429
okay pressure plate is going to light up
one of these and we'll just do this

210
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:43,439
one of these and we'll just do this
 

211
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:49,759
one of these and we'll just do this
rough for right now

212
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:49,769

 

213
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,679

and then the other one is going to be

214
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:51,689
and then the other one is going to be
 

215
00:13:51,689 --> 00:14:15,319
and then the other one is going to be
controlled by a five o'clock this is

216
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:15,329
controlled by a five o'clock this is
 

217
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:17,179
controlled by a five o'clock this is
just an example I'm going to destroy

218
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:17,189
just an example I'm going to destroy
 

219
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:26,979
just an example I'm going to destroy
this once we're done

220
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:26,989

 

221
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:34,639

so five torches make a five o'clock no

222
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:34,649
so five torches make a five o'clock no
 

223
00:14:34,649 --> 00:15:15,590
so five torches make a five o'clock no
that's not going to work like that yeah

224
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600

 

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:26,519

all right and then this goes back okay

226
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:26,529
all right and then this goes back okay
 

227
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,940
all right and then this goes back okay
so we have a stable 5 o'clock here

228
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:28,950
so we have a stable 5 o'clock here
 

229
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,900
so we have a stable 5 o'clock here
that's running through the and eat and

230
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:33,910
that's running through the and eat and
 

231
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,150
that's running through the and eat and
we have the pressure plate hooked up to

232
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
we have the pressure plate hooked up to
 

233
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,050
we have the pressure plate hooked up to
the and heats so an and 8 soaked up

234
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,060
the and heats so an and 8 soaked up
 

235
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,620
the and heats so an and 8 soaked up
through the eight dispensers so what's

236
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:43,630
through the eight dispensers so what's
 

237
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,240
through the eight dispensers so what's
going to happen is we're going to put

238
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,250
going to happen is we're going to put
 

239
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:59,790
going to happen is we're going to put
some cobble in here

240
00:15:59,790 --> 00:15:59,800

 

241
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,870

the reason we're using 8 of them is

242
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:03,880
the reason we're using 8 of them is
 

243
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:14,530
the reason we're using 8 of them is
because it divides into 64 so say we

244
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,540
because it divides into 64 so say we
 

245
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,780
because it divides into 64 so say we
wanted to get cobblestone we just walk

246
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:16,790
wanted to get cobblestone we just walk
 

247
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,830
wanted to get cobblestone we just walk
up to our pressure plate and it would

248
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:20,840
up to our pressure plate and it would
 

249
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:29,470
up to our pressure plate and it would
not work why is it not working wires too

250
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:29,480
not work why is it not working wires too
 

251
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:39,410
not work why is it not working wires too
long

252
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,420

 

253
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:48,530

all right

254
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:48,540

 

255
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,460

yeah we're going to just put up a

256
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,470
yeah we're going to just put up a
 

257
00:16:50,470 --> 00:17:09,180
yeah we're going to just put up a
repeater here that's why we're going to

258
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,190
repeater here that's why we're going to
 

259
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,180
repeater here that's why we're going to
use it stone pressure plate if you want

260
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,190
use it stone pressure plate if you want
 

261
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:27,990
use it stone pressure plate if you want
cobble you just walk up oh it's burning

262
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
cobble you just walk up oh it's burning
 

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,060
cobble you just walk up oh it's burning
out anyway you get the idea I'll I'll

264
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,070
out anyway you get the idea I'll I'll
 

265
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:44,520
out anyway you get the idea I'll I'll
fix it all up and so eight of these

266
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:44,530
fix it all up and so eight of these
 

267
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,770
fix it all up and so eight of these
things holds a roughly a time and a half

268
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:49,780
things holds a roughly a time and a half
 

269
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,620
things holds a roughly a time and a half
I'll put a double chest hold so it's

270
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,630
I'll put a double chest hold so it's
 

271
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,130
I'll put a double chest hold so it's
going to be a bit bigger but it'll be

272
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,140
going to be a bit bigger but it'll be
 

273
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,930
going to be a bit bigger but it'll be
convenient because if you want something

274
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:57,940
convenient because if you want something
 

275
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,540
convenient because if you want something
we'll just walk up and they'll do it to

276
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,550
we'll just walk up and they'll do it to
 

277
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:14,499
we'll just walk up and they'll do it to
you

278
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:14,509

 

279
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:23,750

get crazy the particle accelerator

280
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760

 

281
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:32,650

oh my things like like crazy now okay I

282
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:32,660
oh my things like like crazy now okay I
 

283
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,870
oh my things like like crazy now okay I
figure I'm gonna need about probably 20

284
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:35,880
figure I'm gonna need about probably 20
 

285
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,260
figure I'm gonna need about probably 20
of these dispenser panels and storage

286
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,270
of these dispenser panels and storage
 

287
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:48,500
of these dispenser panels and storage
room and and like I said the storage

288
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,510
room and and like I said the storage
 

289
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,990
room and and like I said the storage
room is going to be round over here and

290
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,000
room is going to be round over here and
 

291
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,570
room is going to be round over here and
it's going to be big so I'll probably

292
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:53,580
it's going to be big so I'll probably
 

293
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,090
it's going to be big so I'll probably
build most of it off camera because it's

294
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,100
build most of it off camera because it's
 

295
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,270
build most of it off camera because it's
going to take a while and I'll probably

296
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
going to take a while and I'll probably
 

297
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,670
going to take a while and I'll probably
hook up a grinder or something to that

298
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:01,680
hook up a grinder or something to that
 

299
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,590
hook up a grinder or something to that
for now so that these guys don't go

300
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:06,600
for now so that these guys don't go
 

301
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,560
for now so that these guys don't go
waste but we're going to end it here now

302
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,570
waste but we're going to end it here now
 

303
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,470
waste but we're going to end it here now
and thanks for watching

304
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,480
and thanks for watching
 

305
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:24,050
and thanks for watching
oh yeah and it's all glass now just to

306
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,060
oh yeah and it's all glass now just to
 

307
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,070
oh yeah and it's all glass now just to
see if it works

308
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080

 

309
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,740

come on

310
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:32,750
come on
 

311
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:39,549
come on
yeah and you know I do not recommend

312
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:39,559
yeah and you know I do not recommend
 

313
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:49,320
yeah and you know I do not recommend
using glass because it lets light in and

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,330
using glass because it lets light in and
 

315
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:57,279
using glass because it lets light in and
it's it doesn't work so unless I'm

316
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:57,289
it's it doesn't work so unless I'm
 

317
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,320
it's it doesn't work so unless I'm
setting this up from somehow Flast is

318
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,330
setting this up from somehow Flast is
 

319
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:07,030
setting this up from somehow Flast is
not okay see you guys next time
