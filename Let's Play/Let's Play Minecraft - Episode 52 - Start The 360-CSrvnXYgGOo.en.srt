00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,020
which is nice to get a nice wide look of

blocks or so and then start building a

98
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:40,449
blocks or so and then start building a
 

99
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,839
blocks or so and then start building a
base fort and an enclosure so that we

100
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:42,849
base fort and an enclosure so that we
 

101
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,110
base fort and an enclosure so that we
can safely inside without getting shot

102
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
can safely inside without getting shot
 

103
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240

anything to go down so I the only way I

118
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:15,019
down without getting shot at and then
 

119
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,129
down without getting shot at and then
somehow start killing like a stone

120
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:20,139

127
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,730
the cannon inside so that's what I'm
going to do I then make a gravel column

128
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:36,740
going to do I then make a gravel column
 

129
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,580

I really glad I'd have to use sand for

144
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:05,750
I really glad I'd have to use sand for
 

145

148
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,390
I think yeah I'm just going to fill this
 

149
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,970
I think yeah I'm just going to fill this
up with gravel to the top I think and

150
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:18,980
up with gravel to the top I think and
 

151
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,500
up with gravel to the top I think and
then I should be able to dig down as far

152
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,510
then I should be able to dig down as far
 

153
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:41,420
then I should be able to dig down as far
as I want to go have ladders with me and

154
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,430
as I want to go have ladders with me and
 

155
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,680
as I want to go have ladders with me and
this is going to be extremely dangerous

156
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,690
this is going to be extremely dangerous
 

157
00:05:44,690 --> 00:06:02,960
this is going to be extremely dangerous
very good chance I'll die and it does

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:02,970
very good chance I'll die and it does
 

159
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,230
very good chance I'll die and it does
like five stacks of gravel at least okay

160
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
like five stacks of gravel at least okay
 

161
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,710
like five stacks of gravel at least okay
so we are at y99 let's go down to let's
