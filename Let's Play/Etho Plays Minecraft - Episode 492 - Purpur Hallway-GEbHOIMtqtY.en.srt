00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,220
doing great I just saw another one like
 

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,130
doing great I just saw another one like
gal over here too let's let's figure out

16
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
gal over here too let's let's figure out
 

17
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,370
gal over here too let's let's figure out
this guy before we do anything

18
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:30,380
this guy before we do anything
 

19
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,139
this guy before we do anything
AHA yeah so check it out guys last

20
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:33,149
AHA yeah so check it out guys last
 

21
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,420
AHA yeah so check it out guys last
episode we messed around with that fade

22
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:35,430
episode we messed around with that fade
 

23
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,610
episode we messed around with that fade
lighting idea and then we got started on

24
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:37,620
lighting idea and then we got started on
 

25
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,590
lighting idea and then we got started on
this project here we're building a

26
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
this project here we're building a
 

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,750
this project here we're building a
dragon egg trophy room so we built the

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
dragon egg trophy room so we built the
 

29
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,979
dragon egg trophy room so we built the
entrance built a very cool dragon statue

30
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:44,989
entrance built a very cool dragon statue
 

31
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,600
entrance built a very cool dragon statue
that everybody loves nobody hates it

32
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,610
that everybody loves nobody hates it
 

33
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,610
that everybody loves nobody hates it
doesn't look like a koala either for

34
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
doesn't look like a koala either for
 

35
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,000
doesn't look like a koala either for
sure yeah there wasn't a lot of love for

36
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,010
sure yeah there wasn't a lot of love for
 

37
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,950
sure yeah there wasn't a lot of love for
the statue but it's a three by three

38
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
the statue but it's a three by three
 

39
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,930
the statue but it's a three by three
like what am I going to do with with

40
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:56,940
like what am I going to do with with
 

41
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,189
like what am I going to do with with
this amount of space or I guess it's

42
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:58,199
this amount of space or I guess it's
 

43
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,529
this amount of space or I guess it's
five wide technically because of the

44
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:00,539
five wide technically because of the
 

45
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,869
five wide technically because of the
quality yours but yeah it kind of

46
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
quality yours but yeah it kind of
 

47
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,880
quality yours but yeah it kind of
reminds me of like a Metroid chozo

48
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:04,890
reminds me of like a Metroid chozo
 

49
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,190
reminds me of like a Metroid chozo
statue thing which i think is cool

50
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
statue thing which i think is cool
 

51
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
statue thing which i think is cool
that's why I built it because I like the

52
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,210
that's why I built it because I like the
 

53
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,050
that's why I built it because I like the
chozo statues sounds like though we're

54
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,060
chozo statues sounds like though we're
 

55
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,820
chozo statues sounds like though we're
going to get rid of these these shoulder

56
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:13,830
going to get rid of these these shoulder
 

57
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,249
going to get rid of these these shoulder
things a lot of you guys agreed they

58
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:16,259
things a lot of you guys agreed they
 

59
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,840
things a lot of you guys agreed they
don't really suit it so let's take those

60
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:17,850
don't really suit it so let's take those
 

61
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,270
don't really suit it so let's take those
outs and I just hooked up the randomizer

62
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,280
outs and I just hooked up the randomizer
 

63
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,200
outs and I just hooked up the randomizer
so it seems to be pretty cool or I think

64
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
so it seems to be pretty cool or I think
 

65
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,530
so it seems to be pretty cool or I think
it looks neat anyways and yeah so this

66
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,540
it looks neat anyways and yeah so this
 

67
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,390
it looks neat anyways and yeah so this
is what it looks like during the daytime

68
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
is what it looks like during the daytime
 

69
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,700
is what it looks like during the daytime
the effect isn't quite as noticeable

70
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:31,710
the effect isn't quite as noticeable
 

71
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,819
the effect isn't quite as noticeable
it's a lot more subtle but you can still

72
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:34,829
it's a lot more subtle but you can still
 

73
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,200
it's a lot more subtle but you can still
see it alright I think it looks pretty

74
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,210
see it alright I think it looks pretty
 

75
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,800
see it alright I think it looks pretty
cool still right now it's stuck on it's

76
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:39,810
cool still right now it's stuck on it's
 

77
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,460
cool still right now it's stuck on it's
fading out nope it does like stay on

78
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,470
fading out nope it does like stay on
 

79
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,719
fading out nope it does like stay on
sometimes for quite a while and

80
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:44,729
sometimes for quite a while and
 

81
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,920
sometimes for quite a while and
sometimes they'll stay off for a while

82
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:45,930
sometimes they'll stay off for a while
 

83
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,010
sometimes they'll stay off for a while
but for the most part it changes quite a

84
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,020
but for the most part it changes quite a
 

85
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,819
but for the most part it changes quite a
bit it's random right it's a pretty good

86
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:52,829
bit it's random right it's a pretty good
 

87
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,999
bit it's random right it's a pretty good
level of randomization I think let's go

88
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:56,009
level of randomization I think let's go
 

89
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,889
level of randomization I think let's go
take a look at the the inside of it how

90
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:57,899
take a look at the the inside of it how
 

91
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,740
take a look at the the inside of it how
it's all working and stuff so I did end

92
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,750
it's all working and stuff so I did end
 

93
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,020
it's all working and stuff so I did end
up using a super fast randomizer like we

94
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
up using a super fast randomizer like we
 

95
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,020
up using a super fast randomizer like we
used when we built the ender ender 3.0

96
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,030
used when we built the ender ender 3.0
 

97
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,330
used when we built the ender ender 3.0
and I threw in a bunch of slabs here so

98
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,340
and I threw in a bunch of slabs here so
 

99
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,880
and I threw in a bunch of slabs here so
that if it gets dark we won't have mob

100
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:10,890
that if it gets dark we won't have mob
 

101
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,830
that if it gets dark we won't have mob
spawning and stuff too

102
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
spawning and stuff too
 

103
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,570
spawning and stuff too
but yeah right now I just have like an

104
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,580
but yeah right now I just have like an
 

105
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,940
but yeah right now I just have like an
on/off with a lever activates a

106
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:16,950
on/off with a lever activates a
 

107
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,350
on/off with a lever activates a
comparator clock that goes to a

108
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,360
comparator clock that goes to a
 

109
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,690
comparator clock that goes to a
randomizer here the superfast randomizer

110
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:22,700
randomizer here the superfast randomizer
 

111
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,490
randomizer here the superfast randomizer
guess we can like break this up so you

112
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,500
guess we can like break this up so you
 

113
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,479
guess we can like break this up so you
can see it again and that triggers this

114
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:29,489
can see it again and that triggers this
 

115
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,280
can see it again and that triggers this
comparator the sword is in here then the

116
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,290
comparator the sword is in here then the
 

117
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,920
comparator the sword is in here then the
signal goes to a distance of two makes

118
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:33,930
signal goes to a distance of two makes
 

119
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,289
signal goes to a distance of two makes
the piston extend here and then that

120
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,299
the piston extend here and then that
 

121
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,900
the piston extend here and then that
alternate switch dropper gets activated

122
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:38,910
alternate switch dropper gets activated
 

123
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,530
alternate switch dropper gets activated
and that changes how many lights turn on

124
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,540
and that changes how many lights turn on
 

125
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,160
and that changes how many lights turn on
and off so it's pretty simple actually

126
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,170
and off so it's pretty simple actually
 

127
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,330
and off so it's pretty simple actually
but it's a pretty cool effect anyways I

128
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,340
but it's a pretty cool effect anyways I
 

129
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,559
but it's a pretty cool effect anyways I
think we're going to work a little bit

130
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:51,569
think we're going to work a little bit
 

131
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,990
think we're going to work a little bit
more on this today again I'll try not to

132
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
more on this today again I'll try not to
 

133
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,420
more on this today again I'll try not to
spend the whole episode on it though but

134
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,430
spend the whole episode on it though but
 

135
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,059
spend the whole episode on it though but
what do we do next what comes next with

136
00:02:59,059 --> 00:02:59,069
what do we do next what comes next with
 

137
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,770
what do we do next what comes next with
this well I want to be able to go down

138
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:00,780
this well I want to be able to go down
 

139
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,809
this well I want to be able to go down
the stairs here then there's going to be

140
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:02,819
the stairs here then there's going to be
 

141
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,900
the stairs here then there's going to be
a hallway with lighting in fade lighting

142
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:05,910
a hallway with lighting in fade lighting
 

143
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,759
a hallway with lighting in fade lighting
and then there's gonna be a room with

144
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:07,769
and then there's gonna be a room with
 

145
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,619
and then there's gonna be a room with
the dragon again that's that's my plan

146
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:09,629
the dragon again that's that's my plan
 

147
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,229
the dragon again that's that's my plan
was this build I feel like we need to

148
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
was this build I feel like we need to
 

149
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,650
was this build I feel like we need to
throw a door in somewhere though because

150
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:14,660
throw a door in somewhere though because
 

151
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,030
throw a door in somewhere though because
like if this is where the dragon egg is

152
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
like if this is where the dragon egg is
 

153
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,849
like if this is where the dragon egg is
it should have some sort of security

154
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:18,859
it should have some sort of security
 

155
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,990
it should have some sort of security
even though I'm the only person in the

156
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,000
even though I'm the only person in the
 

157
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,670
even though I'm the only person in the
in the world here and I'm not going to

158
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
in the world here and I'm not going to
 

159
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,460
in the world here and I'm not going to
steal it just for the feeling I feel

160
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:25,470
steal it just for the feeling I feel
 

161
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,009
steal it just for the feeling I feel
like it needs some sort of a door so

162
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:28,019
like it needs some sort of a door so
 

163
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,569
like it needs some sort of a door so
either we put it here at the very

164
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:29,579
either we put it here at the very
 

165
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,699
either we put it here at the very
entrance or before we enter the room

166
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:31,709
entrance or before we enter the room
 

167
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,660
entrance or before we enter the room
with the dragon egg I did mess around

168
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:35,670
with the dragon egg I did mess around
 

169
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,370
with the dragon egg I did mess around
with like trying to retract the stairs

170
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:39,380
with like trying to retract the stairs
 

171
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,559
with like trying to retract the stairs
up to this level here that's really hard

172
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:42,569
up to this level here that's really hard
 

173
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,180
up to this level here that's really hard
to do though like I can do it with I

174
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,190
to do though like I can do it with I
 

175
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,809
to do though like I can do it with I
think three stairs but not four or five

176
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:47,819
think three stairs but not four or five
 

177
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,449
think three stairs but not four or five
like we have here that's too much it's

178
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:50,459
like we have here that's too much it's
 

179
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,670
like we have here that's too much it's
hard to move them that much using just

180
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
hard to move them that much using just
 

181
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,949
hard to move them that much using just
Pistons so we're going to do a different

182
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
Pistons so we're going to do a different
 

183
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,569
Pistons so we're going to do a different
type of door I was thinking it would be

184
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:56,579
type of door I was thinking it would be
 

185
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,580
type of door I was thinking it would be
a lot of fun if we tried to make a blast

186
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,590
a lot of fun if we tried to make a blast
 

187
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,460
a lot of fun if we tried to make a blast
door like a door you open with TNT

188
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,470
door like a door you open with TNT
 

189
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,129
door like a door you open with TNT
instead of distance so it feels like

190
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:04,139
instead of distance so it feels like
 

191
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,000
instead of distance so it feels like
this dragon egg is sealed away

192
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,010
this dragon egg is sealed away
 

193
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,470
this dragon egg is sealed away
underground here right and we've got to

194
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,480
underground here right and we've got to
 

195
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,170
underground here right and we've got to
blast our way in using TNT and then we

196
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
blast our way in using TNT and then we
 

197
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,059
blast our way in using TNT and then we
have to make the door regenerate somehow

198
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:14,069
have to make the door regenerate somehow
 

199
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,830
have to make the door regenerate somehow
so that's going to be our starter

200
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
so that's going to be our starter
 

201
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
so that's going to be our starter
project here so you can figure that out

202
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:17,849
project here so you can figure that out
 

203
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,399
project here so you can figure that out
okay so I think this is our rough plan

204
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,409
okay so I think this is our rough plan
 

205
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,250
okay so I think this is our rough plan
here something something of this Nate

206
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,260
here something something of this Nate
 

207
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,060
here something something of this Nate
I fall down hole so we have a bunch of

208
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,070
I fall down hole so we have a bunch of
 

209
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,920
I fall down hole so we have a bunch of
Pistons vertically stacked vertically

210
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:31,930
Pistons vertically stacked vertically
 

211
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,080
Pistons vertically stacked vertically
like that we'll have to try generate the

212
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,090
like that we'll have to try generate the
 

213
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,530
like that we'll have to try generate the
cobblestone here in like a column then

214
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:37,540
cobblestone here in like a column then
 

215
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,890
cobblestone here in like a column then
we push it up to 12 blocks away then

216
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:40,900
we push it up to 12 blocks away then
 

217
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,480
we push it up to 12 blocks away then
that will fill in our door frame here

218
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,490
that will fill in our door frame here
 

219
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,870
that will fill in our door frame here
with cobblestone and then like enter a

220
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:45,880
with cobblestone and then like enter a
 

221
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,640
with cobblestone and then like enter a
password or something and then the the

222
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:47,650
password or something and then the the
 

223
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,740
password or something and then the the
cobblestone will get exploded Wien walk

224
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:49,750
cobblestone will get exploded Wien walk
 

225
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,430
cobblestone will get exploded Wien walk
through and then I'll start refilling

226
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
through and then I'll start refilling
 

227
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,660
through and then I'll start refilling
the door frame area here with

228
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,670
the door frame area here with
 

229
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,450
the door frame area here with
cobblestone as it regenerates so how do

230
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,460
cobblestone as it regenerates so how do
 

231
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,480
cobblestone as it regenerates so how do
we make a cobblestone generator that can

232
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,490
we make a cobblestone generator that can
 

233
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,850
we make a cobblestone generator that can
make it in a column like this that's our

234
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:02,860
make it in a column like this that's our
 

235
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,430
make it in a column like this that's our
question okay let's see what happens if

236
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
question okay let's see what happens if
 

237
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,580
question okay let's see what happens if
we put water here

238
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:07,590
we put water here
 

239
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,730
we put water here
will it make oh okay so I didn't make

240
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:11,740
will it make oh okay so I didn't make
 

241
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,350
will it make oh okay so I didn't make
any cobblestone I thought maybe we would

242
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
any cobblestone I thought maybe we would
 

243
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,040
any cobblestone I thought maybe we would
get cobblestone here what about if we

244
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,050
get cobblestone here what about if we
 

245
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,080
get cobblestone here what about if we
update it nope nothing happens then so

246
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,090
update it nope nothing happens then so
 

247
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,230
update it nope nothing happens then so
what happens happens if we put water

248
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
what happens happens if we put water
 

249
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,870
what happens happens if we put water
here okay so it still say it still stays

250
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
here okay so it still say it still stays
 

251
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,100
here okay so it still say it still stays
water there doesn't turn to cobblestone

252
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,110
water there doesn't turn to cobblestone
 

253
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,480
water there doesn't turn to cobblestone
down at the bottom here those where they

254
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,490
down at the bottom here those where they
 

255
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,210
down at the bottom here those where they
mix so I think what we can do I got one

256
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,220
mix so I think what we can do I got one
 

257
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,360
mix so I think what we can do I got one
more fist in there let's grab our

258
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,370
more fist in there let's grab our
 

259
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,040
more fist in there let's grab our
redstone blocks I think if we activate

260
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,050
redstone blocks I think if we activate
 

261
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,620
redstone blocks I think if we activate
the bottom Pistons oh we can't see can't

262
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:52,630
the bottom Pistons oh we can't see can't
 

263
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,640
the bottom Pistons oh we can't see can't
really see here so that made one

264
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:53,650
really see here so that made one
 

265
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,980
really see here so that made one
cobblestone there and we activate the

266
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:55,990
cobblestone there and we activate the
 

267
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,820
cobblestone there and we activate the
next one makes one there I think we just

268
00:05:59,820 --> 00:05:59,830
next one makes one there I think we just
 

269
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,440
next one makes one there I think we just
got to go from the bottom to the top and

270
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,450
got to go from the bottom to the top and
 

271
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,430
got to go from the bottom to the top and
it will make cobblestone and then we

272
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:04,440
it will make cobblestone and then we
 

273
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,910
it will make cobblestone and then we
push the ones over here outward and it

274
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:08,920
push the ones over here outward and it
 

275
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:21,690
push the ones over here outward and it
should be good steep steep so very good

276
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:21,700
should be good steep steep so very good
 

277
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,980
should be good steep steep so very good
guys very good I think we got a rough

278
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,990
guys very good I think we got a rough
 

279
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,600
guys very good I think we got a rough
idea of how to do the door I think we'll

280
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,610
idea of how to do the door I think we'll
 

281
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,590
idea of how to do the door I think we'll
be okay with that

282
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
be okay with that
 

283
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,150
be okay with that
I moved to beacon over here so we're

284
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,160
I moved to beacon over here so we're
 

285
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,890
I moved to beacon over here so we're
gonna have some east mining well while

286
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:28,900
gonna have some east mining well while
 

287
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,560
gonna have some east mining well while
we do this and let's get to holding out

288
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,570
we do this and let's get to holding out
 

289
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,610
we do this and let's get to holding out
a spot here so I tried going straight

290
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,620
a spot here so I tried going straight
 

291
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,310
a spot here so I tried going straight
that was my original plan right and then

292
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:39,320
that was my original plan right and then
 

293
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,930
that was my original plan right and then
we got piston noises we got picking

294
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:41,940
we got piston noises we got picking
 

295
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,040
we got piston noises we got picking
noises you just barely hear it from over

296
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,050
noises you just barely hear it from over
 

297
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,780
noises you just barely hear it from over
here so I think what we'll do instead of

298
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:47,790
here so I think what we'll do instead of
 

299
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,840
here so I think what we'll do instead of
going this way we're actually going to

300
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:50,850
going this way we're actually going to
 

301
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,980
going this way we're actually going to
go this way we'll do like a split

302
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:54,990
go this way we'll do like a split
 

303
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,490
go this way we'll do like a split
staircase then we'll branch off this way

304
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:57,500
staircase then we'll branch off this way
 

305
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,050
staircase then we'll branch off this way
start going straight and I think is oh

306
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,060
start going straight and I think is oh
 

307
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,820
start going straight and I think is oh
yeah there is a cave here look at this

308
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:01,830
yeah there is a cave here look at this
 

309
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,080
yeah there is a cave here look at this
oh boy I didn't like that up really too

310
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,090
oh boy I didn't like that up really too
 

311
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,630
oh boy I didn't like that up really too
much would it make it more interesting

312
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:08,640
much would it make it more interesting
 

313
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,850
much would it make it more interesting
why instead of going straight down here

314
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:10,860
why instead of going straight down here
 

315
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,130
why instead of going straight down here
and then straight down here maybe we

316
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,140
and then straight down here maybe we
 

317
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,720
and then straight down here maybe we
also have some stairs on this side and

318
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:16,730
also have some stairs on this side and
 

319
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,370
also have some stairs on this side and
like leave this area three blocks wide

320
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,380
like leave this area three blocks wide
 

321
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,990
like leave this area three blocks wide
and then stairs on this side three

322
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
and then stairs on this side three
 

323
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
and then stairs on this side three
blocks wide and then try to merge them

324
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:22,890
blocks wide and then try to merge them
 

325
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,090
blocks wide and then try to merge them
together in the middle here

326
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,100
together in the middle here
 

327
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,380
together in the middle here
would that make this more interesting I

328
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,390
would that make this more interesting I
 

329
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,410
would that make this more interesting I
don't know that just like playing

330
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,420
don't know that just like playing
 

331
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,820
don't know that just like playing
staircases seem a little bit boring

332
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:31,830
staircases seem a little bit boring
 

333
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,070
staircases seem a little bit boring
though for this so I think that's what

334
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
though for this so I think that's what
 

335
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,250
though for this so I think that's what
we'll do and I don't know exactly what

336
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,260
we'll do and I don't know exactly what
 

337
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,470
we'll do and I don't know exactly what
style well I know the rough idea of the

338
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,480
style well I know the rough idea of the
 

339
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,840
style well I know the rough idea of the
style for the room I haven't picked out

340
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:41,850
style for the room I haven't picked out
 

341
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,850
style for the room I haven't picked out
the exact blocks yet though I thought we

342
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:43,860
the exact blocks yet though I thought we
 

343
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,480
the exact blocks yet though I thought we
would try to make it end themes but not

344
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,490
would try to make it end themes but not
 

345
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,090
would try to make it end themes but not
necessarily with blocks you find in the

346
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,100
necessarily with blocks you find in the
 

347
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,060
necessarily with blocks you find in the
end so I think in purple right maybe we

348
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,070
end so I think in purple right maybe we
 

349
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,940
end so I think in purple right maybe we
do purple concrete powder for the floor

350
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:55,950
do purple concrete powder for the floor
 

351
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,140
do purple concrete powder for the floor
and then maybe yellows would be good

352
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,150
and then maybe yellows would be good
 

353
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,090
and then maybe yellows would be good

think it merges fairly well although

396
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
think it merges fairly well although
 

397
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,879
think it merges fairly well although
it's a little bit tight over here

398
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:06,889
it's a little bit tight over here
 

399
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,340
it's a little bit tight over here
so maybe we should try to like make it

400
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,350
so maybe we should try to like make it
 

401
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,689
so maybe we should try to like make it
merge more like over here all right and

402
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:14,699
merge more like over here all right and
 

403
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:17,930
merge more like over here all right and
then like bring the wall out here a bit

404
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:17,940
then like bring the wall out here a bit
 

405
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,069
then like bring the wall out here a bit
more would probably be better what else

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:22,939
more would probably be better what else
what else

408
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:22,949
what else
 

409
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,949
what else

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,689
to the concrete color so what we can do
is just put fences down here put carpet

428

what we use aha okay so I tried out a
 

489
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,360
what we use aha okay so I tried out a
little sample here guys give us an idea

490
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,370
little sample here guys give us an idea
 

491
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,790
little sample here guys give us an idea
of what it might look like so these are

492
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
of what it might look like so these are
 

493
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,220
of what it might look like so these are
three colors or our blocks we kind of

494
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,230
three colors or our blocks we kind of
 

495
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,069
three colors or our blocks we kind of
picked out here it's pretty pretty

496
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
picked out here it's pretty pretty
 

497
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,680
picked out here it's pretty pretty
colorful maybe too colorful didn't

colorful maybe too colorful didn't
figure out what I'm doing with the roof

500
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,130
figure out what I'm doing with the roof
 

501
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,150
figure out what I'm doing with the roof
here or the ceiling yet either and the

502
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,160
here or the ceiling yet either and the
 

503
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,019
here or the ceiling yet either and the
walls look maybe a bit plain still so

504
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:38,029
walls look maybe a bit plain still so
 

505
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,129
walls look maybe a bit plain still so
could get around that with hanging up

506
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:40,139
could get around that with hanging up
 

507
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,509
could get around that with hanging up
pictures or something of that nature

508
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
pictures or something of that nature
 

509
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
pictures or something of that nature
just they need a little bit more detail

510
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:43,529
just they need a little bit more detail
 

511
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,250
just they need a little bit more detail

and then I started on the hallway here
 

519
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,210
and then I started on the hallway here
oh we're okay so we're going to use a

little bit of TNT to speed up the mining

522
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,230
little bit of TNT to speed up the mining
 

523
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,290
little bit of TNT to speed up the mining
and for fun

524
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,300
and for fun
 

525
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,410
and for fun

528
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
right that didn't work out so good
 

529
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,100
right that didn't work out so good

532
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:18,690
that actually wasted a lot of time it's
 

533
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,319
that actually wasted a lot of time it's
fine it's all good looks like I

534
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:21,329
fine it's all good looks like I
 

535
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:24,530
fine it's all good looks like I
connected to the water above too so that

536
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:24,540
connected to the water above too so that
 

537
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,460
connected to the water above too so that
probably used a little bit too much

538
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,470

 

539
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:38,620

oh no oh no oh no oh okay that didn't

oh no oh no oh no oh okay that didn't
 

541
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,260
oh no oh no oh no oh okay that didn't
work out either oh we got some blocks

542
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,270
work out either oh we got some blocks
 

543
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,630
work out either oh we got some blocks
here we can pick up all right so I've

544
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:46,640
here we can pick up all right so I've
 

545
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,490
here we can pick up all right so I've
been cleaning up that mess with the TNT

546
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:48,500
been cleaning up that mess with the TNT
 

547
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,070
been cleaning up that mess with the TNT
blocked off all the water so you see

548
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,080
blocked off all the water so you see
 

549
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,540
blocked off all the water so you see
it's nice and flat on the ceiling there

550
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:52,550
it's nice and flat on the ceiling there
 

551
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,880
it's nice and flat on the ceiling there
and after I did that I realized we

552
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:54,890
and after I did that I realized we
 

553
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,530
and after I did that I realized we
didn't really have much vertical space

554
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:56,540
didn't really have much vertical space
 

555
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,780
didn't really have much vertical space
even though we we we've gone down quite

556
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:58,790
even though we we we've gone down quite
 

557
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,160
even though we we we've gone down quite
a few stairs here all right

558
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,170
a few stairs here all right
 

559
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:08,040
a few stairs here all right
oh my aim this three times one feels bad

560
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,050
oh my aim this three times one feels bad
 

561
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,250
oh my aim this three times one feels bad
okay

562
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,260
okay
 

563
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,050
okay
so I added enough another little

564
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,060
so I added enough another little
 

565
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,180
so I added enough another little
staircase here to bring us down like

566
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,190
staircase here to bring us down like
 

567
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,440
staircase here to bring us down like
three more blocks or so no water bite it

568
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:17,450
three more blocks or so no water bite it
 

569
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,780
three more blocks or so no water bite it
and now we're going to start the long

570
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:19,790
and now we're going to start the long
 

571
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,910
and now we're going to start the long
hallway here so at the end of the long

572
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
hallway here so at the end of the long
 

573
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,130
hallway here so at the end of the long
hallway that's where our our special

574
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,140
hallway that's where our our special
 

575
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,150
hallway that's where our our special
door is going to go as we walk down this

576
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
door is going to go as we walk down this
 

577
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,770
door is going to go as we walk down this
hallway what I want to happen is that

578
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:29,780
hallway what I want to happen is that
 

579
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,860
hallway what I want to happen is that
we'll probably step on step through some

580
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:32,870
we'll probably step on step through some
 

581
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,070
we'll probably step on step through some
trip wires there'll be three trip wires

582
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,080
trip wires there'll be three trip wires
 

583
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,390
trip wires there'll be three trip wires
they'll probably one like right around

584
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:37,400
they'll probably one like right around
 

585
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,580
they'll probably one like right around
here when we walk through that it's

586
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:39,590
here when we walk through that it's
 

587
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,050
here when we walk through that it's
going to turn on some fade lighting

588
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,060
going to turn on some fade lighting
 

589
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,520
going to turn on some fade lighting
we're going to have six fade lights in

590
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:42,530
we're going to have six fade lights in
 

591
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,500
we're going to have six fade lights in
total they'll be like one over there and

592
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:44,510
total they'll be like one over there and
 

593
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,590
total they'll be like one over there and
one on that side and as we walk through

594
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
one on that side and as we walk through
 

595
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,110
one on that side and as we walk through
here there's going to be a dark hallway

596
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,120
here there's going to be a dark hallway
 

597
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,300
here there's going to be a dark hallway
that slowly lights up as we walk down I

598
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,310
that slowly lights up as we walk down I
 

599
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,280
that slowly lights up as we walk down I
think that's that's going to be our our

600
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,290
think that's that's going to be our our
 

601
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,560
think that's that's going to be our our
plan here and then that when we leave

602
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,570
plan here and then that when we leave
 

603
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,730
plan here and then that when we leave
we're going to hit those trip wires

604
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:57,740
we're going to hit those trip wires
 

605
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,040
we're going to hit those trip wires
again and the lights are going to turn

606
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,050
again and the lights are going to turn
 

607
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,420
again and the lights are going to turn
off as we leave is what I want to happen

608
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:03,430
off as we leave is what I want to happen
 

609
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:11,220
off as we leave is what I want to happen
so um mm what do we do here maybe I

610
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,230
so um mm what do we do here maybe I
 

611
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,940
so um mm what do we do here maybe I
don't know if I'm going to keep these

612
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:12,950
don't know if I'm going to keep these
 

613
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,160
don't know if I'm going to keep these
purpura blocks here I just wanted to try

614
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,170
purpura blocks here I just wanted to try
 

615
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,080
purpura blocks here I just wanted to try
put some perper blocks next this kind of

616
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,090
put some perper blocks next this kind of
 

617
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,460
put some perper blocks next this kind of
highlights the walkway a little bit more

618
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,470
highlights the walkway a little bit more
 

619
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,950
highlights the walkway a little bit more
yeah because then you got this little 3d

620
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:23,960
yeah because then you got this little 3d
 

621
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,730
yeah because then you got this little 3d
effect with it I think that's good okay

622
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:27,740
effect with it I think that's good okay
 

623
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,220
effect with it I think that's good okay
so I made it really dark in here down

624
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,230
so I made it really dark in here down
 

625
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,570
so I made it really dark in here down
this hallway so we can kind of imagine

626
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:31,580
this hallway so we can kind of imagine
 

627
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,130
this hallway so we can kind of imagine
where we're going to actually put the

628
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,140
where we're going to actually put the
 

629
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,290
where we're going to actually put the
lighting and I've been thinking about a

630
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,300
lighting and I've been thinking about a
 

631
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,020
lighting and I've been thinking about a
few things like for one thing I was

632
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,030
few things like for one thing I was
 

633
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,250
few things like for one thing I was
going to put the lighting like right

634
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,260
going to put the lighting like right
 

635
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,070
going to put the lighting like right
across from each other like this but

636
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,080
across from each other like this but
 

637
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
across from each other like this but
when you do that and you have like a

638
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,370
when you do that and you have like a
 

639
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,320
when you do that and you have like a
long

640
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,330
long
 

641
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,350
long
hallway and then you form a line when

642
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
hallway and then you form a line when
 

643
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,330
hallway and then you form a line when
you put it like that right and there's

644
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:49,340
you put it like that right and there's
 

645
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,620
you put it like that right and there's
going to be another line ahead and

646
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,630
going to be another line ahead and
 

647
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,970
going to be another line ahead and
another line ahead it's not going to

648
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:51,980
another line ahead it's not going to
 

649
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,770
another line ahead it's not going to
look super great actually so we should

650
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:53,780
look super great actually so we should
 

651
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,010
look super great actually so we should
probably alternate the torches so if

652
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,020
probably alternate the torches so if
 

653
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,920
probably alternate the torches so if
that one's there then on the other side

654
00:14:59,920 --> 00:14:59,930
that one's there then on the other side
 

655
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,290
that one's there then on the other side
we go ahead like three blocks or so put

656
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,300
we go ahead like three blocks or so put
 

657
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,990
we go ahead like three blocks or so put
a torch for our fade light I mean then

658
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,000
a torch for our fade light I mean then
 

659
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,490
a torch for our fade light I mean then
on the other side go ahead three more

660
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:06,500
on the other side go ahead three more
 

661
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,350
on the other side go ahead three more
and put another one and that will create

662
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,360
and put another one and that will create
 

663
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,910
and put another one and that will create
a better looking pattern on the floor

664
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
a better looking pattern on the floor
 

665
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
a better looking pattern on the floor
with the lighting yeah so it'll do like

666
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,690
with the lighting yeah so it'll do like
 

667
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,120
with the lighting yeah so it'll do like
those little u shapes instead on the

668
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,130
those little u shapes instead on the
 

669
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,660
those little u shapes instead on the
side I think that looks better in total

670
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:19,670
side I think that looks better in total
 

671
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,190
side I think that looks better in total
we're only going to do six fade lights

672
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,200
we're only going to do six fade lights
 

673
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,070
we're only going to do six fade lights
so I think our trip wire is going to be

674
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,080
so I think our trip wire is going to be
 

675
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,010
so I think our trip wire is going to be
over here and rather than having a trip

676
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,020
over here and rather than having a trip
 

677
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,130
over here and rather than having a trip
wire for each like set of lights we'll

678
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,140
wire for each like set of lights we'll
 

679
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,420
wire for each like set of lights we'll
just have one trip wire and then we'll

680
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,430
just have one trip wire and then we'll
 

681
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,850
just have one trip wire and then we'll
hook them up to repeaters maybe to

682
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:33,860
hook them up to repeaters maybe to
 

683
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,100
hook them up to repeaters maybe to
adjust how much delay we want them

684
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,110
adjust how much delay we want them
 

685
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,550
adjust how much delay we want them
turning on with but yeah I guess we're

686
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:39,560
turning on with but yeah I guess we're
 

687
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,200
turning on with but yeah I guess we're
about 50 minutes into the episode

688
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,210
about 50 minutes into the episode
 

689
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,330
about 50 minutes into the episode
already so maybe we pause this here for

690
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,340
already so maybe we pause this here for
 

691
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,700
already so maybe we pause this here for
this episode continue it again next time

692
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,710
this episode continue it again next time
 

693
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,140
this episode continue it again next time
and let me know what you guys think

694
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,150
and let me know what you guys think
 

695
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,670
and let me know what you guys think
about like the color scheme and stuff

696
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:48,680
about like the color scheme and stuff
 

697
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,040
about like the color scheme and stuff
might change it depending on what you

698
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,050
might change it depending on what you
 

699
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,460
might change it depending on what you
say and if you got any ideas for this

700
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,470
say and if you got any ideas for this
 

701
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,910
say and if you got any ideas for this
too

702
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:54,920
too
 

703
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,970
too
let me know but yeah we'll go try do

704
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:57,980
let me know but yeah we'll go try do
 

705
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,260
let me know but yeah we'll go try do
something else here before we wrap up

706
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,270
something else here before we wrap up
 

707
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,600
something else here before we wrap up
the episode so I was thinking maybe

708
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,610
the episode so I was thinking maybe
 

709
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,850
the episode so I was thinking maybe
we'll work on our mural again today guys

710
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:03,860
we'll work on our mural again today guys
 

711
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,500
we'll work on our mural again today guys
we'll try to get one more side done on

712
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,510
we'll try to get one more side done on
 

713
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,020
we'll try to get one more side done on
this there's three sides total we worked

714
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,030
this there's three sides total we worked
 

715
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,290
this there's three sides total we worked
on one we got our forest biome in place

716
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:11,300
on one we got our forest biome in place
 

717
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,850
on one we got our forest biome in place
and now I think on this side we're going

718
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:12,860
and now I think on this side we're going
 

719
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,590
and now I think on this side we're going
to do deserts we're going to go for a

720
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:14,600
to do deserts we're going to go for a
 

721
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,620
to do deserts we're going to go for a
desert theme as well as probably the

722
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,630
desert theme as well as probably the
 

723
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,450
desert theme as well as probably the
Mesa biome so first thing we're going to

724
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:19,460
Mesa biome so first thing we're going to
 

725
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,940
Mesa biome so first thing we're going to
do put down some sand here and see what

726
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:21,950
do put down some sand here and see what
 

727
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,400
do put down some sand here and see what
that looks like so our goal is to like

728
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,410
that looks like so our goal is to like
 

729
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,180
that looks like so our goal is to like
make a little miniature desert and Mesa

730
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,190
make a little miniature desert and Mesa
 

731
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,830
make a little miniature desert and Mesa
so for the desert I think we're going to

732
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:29,840
so for the desert I think we're going to
 

733
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,530
so for the desert I think we're going to
put in one of those desert temples in

734
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:32,540
put in one of those desert temples in
 

735
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,630
put in one of those desert temples in
the Mesa we'll probably do some like

736
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:34,640
the Mesa we'll probably do some like
 

737
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,450
the Mesa we'll probably do some like
Mesa hills and stuff probably look

738
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:37,460
Mesa hills and stuff probably look
 

739
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,070
Mesa hills and stuff probably look
pretty good and we'll switch over to

740
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,080
pretty good and we'll switch over to
 

741
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,460
pretty good and we'll switch over to
like orange orange sand for that alright

742
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:42,470
like orange orange sand for that alright
 

743
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,750
like orange orange sand for that alright
so how's this looking right now do too

744
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:46,760
so how's this looking right now do too
 

745
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
so how's this looking right now do too
oh it kind of goes with this sandstone

746
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:48,770
oh it kind of goes with this sandstone
 

747
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,200
oh it kind of goes with this sandstone
hmm is that a problem I think it'll be

748
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,210
hmm is that a problem I think it'll be
 

749
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,240
hmm is that a problem I think it'll be
fine right I also just went and I got

750
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,250
fine right I also just went and I got
 

751
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,710
fine right I also just went and I got
like some some dead bushes and some

752
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:57,720
like some some dead bushes and some
 

753
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,179
like some some dead bushes and some
Gatos and that kind of stuff do I think

754
00:16:59,179 --> 00:16:59,189
Gatos and that kind of stuff do I think
 

755
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:02,960
Gatos and that kind of stuff do I think
we'll make this look a lot better okay

756
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:02,970
we'll make this look a lot better okay
 

757
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,460
we'll make this look a lot better okay
you might facepalm a little bit on this

758
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,470
you might facepalm a little bit on this
 

759
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,169
you might facepalm a little bit on this
so I'm trying to build the the desert

760
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:06,179
so I'm trying to build the the desert
 

761
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,779
so I'm trying to build the the desert
temple and it's really hard to get like

762
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:08,789
temple and it's really hard to get like
 

763
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,289
temple and it's really hard to get like
any any level of detail like with the

764
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:12,299
any any level of detail like with the
 

765
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,760
any any level of detail like with the
size I'm trying to do but that's kind of

766
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:13,770
size I'm trying to do but that's kind of
 

767
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,870
size I'm trying to do but that's kind of
what I got right now we got our two

768
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
what I got right now we got our two
 

769
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,240
what I got right now we got our two
towers and then there's like a pyramid

770
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,250
towers and then there's like a pyramid
 

771
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,390
towers and then there's like a pyramid
in the middle right so that's what I did

772
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
in the middle right so that's what I did
 

773
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,779
in the middle right so that's what I did
here um we'll give it a bit more detail

774
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:23,789
here um we'll give it a bit more detail
 

775
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,789
here um we'll give it a bit more detail
and see if that helps it helps it out

776
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:25,799
and see if that helps it helps it out
 

777
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,460
and see if that helps it helps it out
these towers they kind of need to be two

778
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,470
these towers they kind of need to be two
 

779
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,950
these towers they kind of need to be two
blocks wide though I feel but if we do

780
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
blocks wide though I feel but if we do
 

781
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,060
blocks wide though I feel but if we do
that then we can't have the orange roll

782
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,070
that then we can't have the orange roll
 

783
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,250
that then we can't have the orange roll
right unless like what happens if we

784
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:40,260
right unless like what happens if we
 

785
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,460
right unless like what happens if we
just shave off this the edges here

786
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,470
just shave off this the edges here
 

787
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,950
just shave off this the edges here
maybe it'll still work but it won't be

788
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:45,960
maybe it'll still work but it won't be
 

789
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,850
maybe it'll still work but it won't be
centered mmm

790
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:48,860
centered mmm
 

791
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,500
centered mmm
gonna be tricky I think it's gonna work

792
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,510
gonna be tricky I think it's gonna work
 

793
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,399
gonna be tricky I think it's gonna work
okay let's take a look yeah it looks

794
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:55,409
okay let's take a look yeah it looks
 

795
00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:00,649
okay let's take a look yeah it looks
goofy hmm we might actually be able to

796
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:00,659
goofy hmm we might actually be able to
 

797
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,909
goofy hmm we might actually be able to
get this to work you just got to believe

798
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
get this to work you just got to believe
 

799
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,210
get this to work you just got to believe
in me a little bit here what we'll do

800
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,220
in me a little bit here what we'll do
 

801
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,960
in me a little bit here what we'll do
you ready for this

802
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:05,970
you ready for this
 

803
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,140
you ready for this
first thing is I think the pyramid part

804
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,150
first thing is I think the pyramid part
 

805
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,080
first thing is I think the pyramid part
is too steep like it's a no I don't

806
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,090
is too steep like it's a no I don't
 

807
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,580
is too steep like it's a no I don't
think it's actually that steep I think

808
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,590
think it's actually that steep I think
 

809
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,760
think it's actually that steep I think
what we'll do is raise this up all right

810
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:16,770
what we'll do is raise this up all right
 

811
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,470
what we'll do is raise this up all right
then we will slab there instead that

812
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,480
then we will slab there instead that
 

813
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,380
then we will slab there instead that
might be more more the shape and that

814
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:24,390
might be more more the shape and that
 

815
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,940
might be more more the shape and that
way it doesn't look as tall either

816
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:25,950
way it doesn't look as tall either
 

817
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,230
way it doesn't look as tall either
because it was kind of close to the same

818
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,240
because it was kind of close to the same
 

819
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,610
because it was kind of close to the same
height as the towers which isn't right

820
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:28,620
height as the towers which isn't right
 

821
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
height as the towers which isn't right
either now I think it'll be a little bit

822
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:30,630
either now I think it'll be a little bit
 

823
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,340
either now I think it'll be a little bit
more proportional all right and then

824
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,350
more proportional all right and then
 

825
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,510
more proportional all right and then
with the towers they have like a little

826
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
with the towers they have like a little
 

827
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,220
with the towers they have like a little
thing at the top here too it's not flat

828
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,230
thing at the top here too it's not flat
 

829
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,409
thing at the top here too it's not flat
at the top it's a little bit that sticks

830
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:42,419
at the top it's a little bit that sticks
 

831
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,330
at the top it's a little bit that sticks
out so what we'll do is change this to

832
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,340
out so what we'll do is change this to
 

833
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,180
out so what we'll do is change this to
stairs and connect them together if we

834
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,190
stairs and connect them together if we
 

835
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,039
stairs and connect them together if we
can so do something like that go over

836
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,049
can so do something like that go over
 

837
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:55,220
can so do something like that go over
here and then all they'll connect

838
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,230
here and then all they'll connect
 

839
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,330
here and then all they'll connect
together like that possibly we could

840
00:18:59,330 --> 00:18:59,340
together like that possibly we could
 

841
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,669
together like that possibly we could
possibly still keep the orange wall and

842
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
possibly still keep the orange wall and
 

843
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,860
possibly still keep the orange wall and
have it centered if we do something with

844
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:03,870
have it centered if we do something with
 

845
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,850
have it centered if we do something with
stairs here and then recess it a little

846
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:07,860
stairs here and then recess it a little
 

847
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,900
stairs here and then recess it a little
bit

848
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:09,910
bit
 

849
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,450
bit
but then on the sides it probably won't

850
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:12,460
but then on the sides it probably won't
 

851
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,740
but then on the sides it probably won't
work right let's see we'll try it we'll

852
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:16,750
work right let's see we'll try it we'll
 

853
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,320
work right let's see we'll try it we'll
see what it looks like so you do that

854
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,330
see what it looks like so you do that
 

855
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,460
see what it looks like so you do that
and then you can put the orange wool

856
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,470
and then you can put the orange wool
 

857
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,980
and then you can put the orange wool
back here somehow cover that up maybe

858
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:27,990

 

859
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,540

all right well this was like the best I

860
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,550
all right well this was like the best I
 

861
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,000
all right well this was like the best I
could do guys this is a 9 wide at desert

862
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,010
could do guys this is a 9 wide at desert
 

863
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,640
could do guys this is a 9 wide at desert
temples 9 by 5 all right

864
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:35,650
temples 9 by 5 all right
 

865
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,130
temples 9 by 5 all right
I think the proportions are pretty close

866
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,140
I think the proportions are pretty close
 

867
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,440
I think the proportions are pretty close
we got the orange roll in including in

868
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,450
we got the orange roll in including in
 

869
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,490
we got the orange roll in including in
the middle there because there is a

870
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:41,500
the middle there because there is a
 

871
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,890
the middle there because there is a
little bit in the middle and we have our

872
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:43,900
little bit in the middle and we have our
 

873
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,440
little bit in the middle and we have our
entrance I put a chest in there I don't

874
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,450
entrance I put a chest in there I don't
 

875
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,880
entrance I put a chest in there I don't
know if it's better with the chest or

876
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:47,890
know if it's better with the chest or
 

877
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,960
know if it's better with the chest or
without it right I put like some dark

878
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:50,970
without it right I put like some dark
 

879
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,760
without it right I put like some dark
dark clay here to sort of make it look

880
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,770
dark clay here to sort of make it look
 

881
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,560
dark clay here to sort of make it look
like it opens up inside and it's better

882
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:58,570
like it opens up inside and it's better
 

883
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,040
like it opens up inside and it's better
without the chest right probably and

884
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,050
without the chest right probably and
 

885
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,690
without the chest right probably and
then to cover up the orange on the side

886
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:03,700
then to cover up the orange on the side
 

887
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,210
then to cover up the orange on the side
there I just piled up sand kind of like

888
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,220
there I just piled up sand kind of like
 

889
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,740
there I just piled up sand kind of like
like desert temples are usually

890
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:07,750
like desert temples are usually
 

891
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,090
like desert temples are usually
underground a little bit right so I

892
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,100
underground a little bit right so I
 

893
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,340
underground a little bit right so I
think that kind of works put in some

894
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,350
think that kind of works put in some
 

895
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,490
think that kind of works put in some
cactus and I think that's our desert

896
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:14,500
cactus and I think that's our desert
 

897
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,780
cactus and I think that's our desert
roughly done so we're going to move on

898
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:15,790
roughly done so we're going to move on
 

899
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,990
roughly done so we're going to move on
to the Mesa now now are you ready for

900
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,000
to the Mesa now now are you ready for
 

901
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,730
to the Mesa now now are you ready for
the Mesa plan guys this is where things

902
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:20,740
the Mesa plan guys this is where things
 

903
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,090
the Mesa plan guys this is where things
get crazy what I want to do is have two

904
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,100
get crazy what I want to do is have two
 

905
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
get crazy what I want to do is have two
cliffs right so I want to cliff like

906
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,110
cliffs right so I want to cliff like
 

907
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,200
cliffs right so I want to cliff like
there will probably go five or six

908
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,210
there will probably go five or six
 

909
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,540
there will probably go five or six
blocks tall and another one on this side

910
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,550
blocks tall and another one on this side
 

911
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,640
blocks tall and another one on this side
and then there's going to be like a

912
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,650
and then there's going to be like a
 

913
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,040
and then there's going to be like a
bridge between them and maybe a river in

914
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,050
bridge between them and maybe a river in
 

915
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,810
bridge between them and maybe a river in
the middle kind of like we did over

916
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:36,820
the middle kind of like we did over
 

917
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,390
the middle kind of like we did over
there the way we did the water there

918
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
there the way we did the water there
 

919
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,720
there the way we did the water there
might be cool so to do the Mesa we're

920
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,730
might be cool so to do the Mesa we're
 

921
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,270
might be cool so to do the Mesa we're
going to do layers we'll do some like

922
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
going to do layers we'll do some like
 

923
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,490
going to do layers we'll do some like
hardened clay to begin with and we'll

924
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:47,500
hardened clay to begin with and we'll
 

925
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,740
hardened clay to begin with and we'll
try stack it up and make some sort of

926
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:49,750
try stack it up and make some sort of
 

927
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,310
try stack it up and make some sort of
cliff formation maybe we'll do that for

928
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,320
cliff formation maybe we'll do that for
 

929
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,990
cliff formation maybe we'll do that for
right now then we'll go up with and the

930
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,000
right now then we'll go up with and the
 

931
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,150
right now then we'll go up with and the
next color and I don't know what shape

932
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,160
next color and I don't know what shape
 

933
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,040
next color and I don't know what shape
to do it I'm just going to do it random

934
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,050
to do it I'm just going to do it random
 

935
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,820
to do it I'm just going to do it random
and change it if it doesn't look good

936
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:04,830
and change it if it doesn't look good
 

937
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,160
and change it if it doesn't look good
we're going to be harder than I thought

938
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,170
we're going to be harder than I thought
 

939
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,220
we're going to be harder than I thought
hmm okay we can improvise let's just

940
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,230
hmm okay we can improvise let's just
 

941
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,470
hmm okay we can improvise let's just
change it around a little bit maybe

942
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,480
change it around a little bit maybe
 

943
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,630
change it around a little bit maybe
it'll work it would almost look better

944
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:15,640
it'll work it would almost look better
 

945
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,220
it'll work it would almost look better
if it was all one color this is almost

946
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,230
if it was all one color this is almost
 

947
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,280
if it was all one color this is almost
too crazy looking right maybe we'll do

948
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,290
too crazy looking right maybe we'll do
 

949
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,549
too crazy looking right maybe we'll do
it all out of hardened clay

950
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:23,559

 

951
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,409

all right so check it out guys I fiddled

952
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:25,419
all right so check it out guys I fiddled
 

953
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:26,789
all right so check it out guys I fiddled
around with this thing for quite a bit

954
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
around with this thing for quite a bit
 

955
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,460
around with this thing for quite a bit
actually I made it all out of hardened

956
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,470
actually I made it all out of hardened
 

957
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,289
actually I made it all out of hardened
clay and it looked okay but then I

958
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:31,299
clay and it looked okay but then I
 

959
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:34,049
clay and it looked okay but then I
decided to try like mixing the stripes

960
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:34,059
decided to try like mixing the stripes
 

961
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,840
decided to try like mixing the stripes
again and I just did the the colors

962
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:36,850
again and I just did the the colors
 

963
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,549
again and I just did the the colors
closest to the hardened clay so it

964
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
closest to the hardened clay so it
 

965
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,139
closest to the hardened clay so it
wouldn't stand out quite as much like

966
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:40,149
wouldn't stand out quite as much like
 

967
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:42,090
wouldn't stand out quite as much like
instead of using yellow and that that

968
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,100
instead of using yellow and that that
 

969
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,430
instead of using yellow and that that
kind of thing then I mixed in some dirts

970
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:44,440
kind of thing then I mixed in some dirts
 

971
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,580
kind of thing then I mixed in some dirts
and that really really helps the salads

972
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,590
and that really really helps the salads
 

973
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,039
and that really really helps the salads
and a little bit of plants and some dead

974
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,049
and a little bit of plants and some dead
 

975
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,279
and a little bit of plants and some dead
bushes we got our drawbridge a little

976
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:53,289
bushes we got our drawbridge a little
 

977
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,950
bushes we got our drawbridge a little
bit on the low details and now I want to

978
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:55,960
bit on the low details and now I want to
 

979
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,220
bit on the low details and now I want to
try puttin the whatchamacallit the river

980
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,230
try puttin the whatchamacallit the river
 

981
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,399
try puttin the whatchamacallit the river
here so without the river it looks like

982
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:02,409
here so without the river it looks like
 

983
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,549
here so without the river it looks like
this all right that's where the flat

984
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:05,559
this all right that's where the flat
 

985
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,340
this all right that's where the flat
ground would be with the river what

986
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,350
ground would be with the river what
 

987
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,379
ground would be with the river what
we're going to do is put water here I've

988
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:10,389
we're going to do is put water here I've
 

989
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:15,810
we're going to do is put water here I've
got some lighting here as well like this

990
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:15,820
got some lighting here as well like this
 

991
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,850
got some lighting here as well like this
and there's our river so yeah I like

992
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:20,860
and there's our river so yeah I like
 

993
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,080
and there's our river so yeah I like
that I think it's better with the river

994
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,090
that I think it's better with the river
 

995
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,019
that I think it's better with the river
right I've got some lighting hidden at

996
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:25,029
right I've got some lighting hidden at
 

997
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,669
right I've got some lighting hidden at
the top there and throughout the whole

998
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:26,679
the top there and throughout the whole
 

999
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,249
the top there and throughout the whole
thing too so it would it won't spawn

1000
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:29,259
thing too so it would it won't spawn
 

1001
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,859
thing too so it would it won't spawn
mobs hopefully we should probably check

1002
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:31,869
mobs hopefully we should probably check
 

1003
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,489
mobs hopefully we should probably check
that actually so this is ten nine eight

1004
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:34,499
that actually so this is ten nine eight
 

1005
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,820
that actually so this is ten nine eight
ten twelve yeah that all looks good

1006
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:37,830
ten twelve yeah that all looks good
 

1007
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,960
ten twelve yeah that all looks good
there's a torch at the top of that and

1008
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:39,970
there's a torch at the top of that and
 

1009
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,580
there's a torch at the top of that and
the top of that so I'm not worried about

1010
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,590
the top of that so I'm not worried about
 

1011
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,259
the top of that so I'm not worried about
that over here looks a little dark oh

1012
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:43,269
that over here looks a little dark oh
 

1013
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:48,779
that over here looks a little dark oh
it's a six hmmm where to hide more

1014
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:48,789
it's a six hmmm where to hide more
 

1015
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:52,470
it's a six hmmm where to hide more
lighting is the question it's kind of

1016
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
lighting is the question it's kind of
 

1017
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,190
lighting is the question it's kind of
hoping that glowstone would be enough

1018
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
hoping that glowstone would be enough
 

1019
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,570
hoping that glowstone would be enough
anyway I'll worry about that a little

1020
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:57,580
anyway I'll worry about that a little
 

1021
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,269
anyway I'll worry about that a little
bit later I guess yeah I think besides

1022
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:00,279
bit later I guess yeah I think besides
 

1023
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,639
bit later I guess yeah I think besides
