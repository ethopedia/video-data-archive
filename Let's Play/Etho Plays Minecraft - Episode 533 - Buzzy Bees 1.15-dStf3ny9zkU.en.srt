00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,580
bees in the game we have honey blocks
and all kinds of cool stuff like that

22
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,590
and all kinds of cool stuff like that
 

23
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,770
and all kinds of cool stuff like that
it's mostly a bug fix update though but

24
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:36,780
it's mostly a bug fix update though but
 

25
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,950
it's mostly a bug fix update though but
pretty excited about the bee things so

26
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:39,960
pretty excited about the bee things so
 

27
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,720
pretty excited about the bee things so
I've been out and about exploring our

28
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:41,730
I've been out and about exploring our
 

29
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,100
I've been out and about exploring our
world here looking in new terrain

30
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,110
world here looking in new terrain
 

31
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,750
world here looking in new terrain
because these do not generate in

32
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:44,760
because these do not generate in
 

33
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,330
because these do not generate in
all-terrain no no no no you can't just

34
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,340
all-terrain no no no no you can't just
 

35
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,130
all-terrain no no no no you can't just
grow a tree to make them generates or

36
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,140
grow a tree to make them generates or
 

37
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,319
grow a tree to make them generates or
anything like that you have to generate

38
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:51,329
anything like that you have to generate
 

39
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,180
anything like that you have to generate
new chunks and when a tree spawns in

40
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,190
new chunks and when a tree spawns in
 

41
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,569
new chunks and when a tree spawns in
those chunks you have a 5% chance it'll

42
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:56,579
those chunks you have a 5% chance it'll
 

43
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,959
those chunks you have a 5% chance it'll
spawn a beehive wild beehive like this

44
00:00:59,959 --> 00:00:59,969
spawn a beehive wild beehive like this
 

45
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,900
spawn a beehive wild beehive like this
now they also only spawn in plain

46
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:02,910
now they also only spawn in plain
 

47
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,870
now they also only spawn in plain
sunflower Plains or flower forest so

48
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:05,880
sunflower Plains or flower forest so
 

49
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,429
sunflower Plains or flower forest so
flower forest is probably the best place

50
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
flower forest is probably the best place
 

51
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,649
flower forest is probably the best place
to get them but I don't have like any

52
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:09,659
to get them but I don't have like any
 

53
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,090
to get them but I don't have like any
flower forest in my world or I have

54
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,100
flower forest in my world or I have
 

55
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,670
flower forest in my world or I have
trouble finding it so it's been hunting

56
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
trouble finding it so it's been hunting
 

57
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,249
trouble finding it so it's been hunting
around the the Plains here I've been

58
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:16,259
around the the Plains here I've been
 

59
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,539
around the the Plains here I've been
watching it for a little bit looks like

60
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:17,549
watching it for a little bit looks like
 

61
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,550
watching it for a little bit looks like
the bees have have made some honey so

62
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
the bees have have made some honey so
 

63
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,929
the bees have have made some honey so
they come out of the hive every so often

64
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:20,939
they come out of the hive every so often
 

65
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,450
they come out of the hive every so often
and then they go look for the flowers

66
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,460
and then they go look for the flowers
 

67
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,200
and then they go look for the flowers
there they're big chunky little dudes

68
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,210
there they're big chunky little dudes
 

69
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,640
there they're big chunky little dudes
they pollinate the flowers and then they

70
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,650
they pollinate the flowers and then they
 

71
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,380
they pollinate the flowers and then they
bring it back to the earth they're their

72
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,390
bring it back to the earth they're their
 

73
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,899
bring it back to the earth they're their
hive and like every five times they do

74
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:32,909
hive and like every five times they do
 

75
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,940
hive and like every five times they do
that they produce honey or honeycomb

76
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:34,950
that they produce honey or honeycomb
 

77
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,499
that they produce honey or honeycomb
that we can harvest so if we want to

78
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:39,509
that we can harvest so if we want to
 

79
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,770
that we can harvest so if we want to
collect the hive here there's a couple

80
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
collect the hive here there's a couple
 

81
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,960
collect the hive here there's a couple
ways to do it if we don't have like silk

82
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:47,970
ways to do it if we don't have like silk
 

83
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,850
ways to do it if we don't have like silk
touch on us and we want it as break it's

84
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860
touch on us and we want it as break it's
 

85
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,920
touch on us and we want it as break it's
we have to put a campfire underneath it

86
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:51,930
we have to put a campfire underneath it
 

87
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,450
we have to put a campfire underneath it
I believe so that they don't get hostile

88
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,460
I believe so that they don't get hostile
 

89
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,090
I believe so that they don't get hostile
otherwise when you break it they they

90
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,100
otherwise when you break it they they
 

91
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,030
otherwise when you break it they they
just all come flying out of the hive and

92
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
just all come flying out of the hive and
 

93
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,270
just all come flying out of the hive and
attack you okay that didn't work

94
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,280
attack you okay that didn't work
 

95
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:14,030
attack you okay that didn't work
nevermind by the fire

96
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
nevermind by the fire
 

97
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,410
nevermind by the fire
okay so that doesn't work I thought it

98
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:16,420
okay so that doesn't work I thought it
 

99
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,399
okay so that doesn't work I thought it
did no and they stung me and I'm poisons

100
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:20,409
did no and they stung me and I'm poisons
 

101
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,860
did no and they stung me and I'm poisons
and after they sting you they lose their

102
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:22,870
and after they sting you they lose their
 

103
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,600
and after they sting you they lose their
stinger and they die in like a minute

104
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:24,610
stinger and they die in like a minute
 

105
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,690
stinger and they die in like a minute
afterwards if you look at him on the

106
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:27,700
afterwards if you look at him on the
 

107
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,119
afterwards if you look at him on the
back here he's got like got no stinger

108
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:30,129
back here he's got like got no stinger
 

109
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:37,940
back here he's got like got no stinger
now okay I gotta go find a new one now

110
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:37,950

 

111
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,170

all right I got pretty lucky here I

112
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,180
all right I got pretty lucky here I
 

113
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,880
all right I got pretty lucky here I
think this is the same Plains biome and

114
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,890
think this is the same Plains biome and
 

115
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,339
think this is the same Plains biome and
I found another hive so that's cool the

116
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:44,349
I found another hive so that's cool the
 

117
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,259
I found another hive so that's cool the
Sun is setting right now we got a couple

118
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:46,269
Sun is setting right now we got a couple
 

119
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,210
Sun is setting right now we got a couple
bees out and about I found three of them

120
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,220
bees out and about I found three of them
 

121
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,099
bees out and about I found three of them
flying around there's one right over

122
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:50,109
flying around there's one right over
 

123
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,020
flying around there's one right over
there I'm kind of watching them cuz I

124
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,030
there I'm kind of watching them cuz I
 

125
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,250
there I'm kind of watching them cuz I
think they're supposed to return to

126
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,260
think they're supposed to return to
 

127
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,890
think they're supposed to return to
their bee hive at nighttime right now it

128
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:55,900
their bee hive at nighttime right now it
 

129
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,880
their bee hive at nighttime right now it
looks like he's still looking for

130
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:56,890
looks like he's still looking for
 

131
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,430
looks like he's still looking for
flowers because it you found one over

132
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
flowers because it you found one over
 

133
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,880
flowers because it you found one over
there oh there's another hive here oh

134
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:04,890

 

135
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,990

alright well that's great news that

136
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
alright well that's great news that
 

137
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,849
alright well that's great news that
means we have two chances here to get a

138
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:08,859
means we have two chances here to get a
 

139
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,449
means we have two chances here to get a
bee hive without messing up hopefully so

140
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:12,459
bee hive without messing up hopefully so
 

141
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,440
bee hive without messing up hopefully so
I looked around I don't see any more

142
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,450
I looked around I don't see any more
 

143
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,670
I looked around I don't see any more
bees flying around so I think they

144
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
bees flying around so I think they
 

145
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,619
bees flying around so I think they
returned to their base I'm gonna use a

146
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:16,629
returned to their base I'm gonna use a
 

147
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,289
returned to their base I'm gonna use a
silk touch ax this time I think the ax

148
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:19,299
silk touch ax this time I think the ax
 

149
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,030
silk touch ax this time I think the ax
is the proper tool for harvesting these

150
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
is the proper tool for harvesting these
 

151
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,640
is the proper tool for harvesting these
and this time we'll have silk touch and

152
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650
and this time we'll have silk touch and
 

153
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,420
and this time we'll have silk touch and
yes it drops as a block now so it says

154
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,430
yes it drops as a block now so it says
 

155
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,280
yes it drops as a block now so it says
it's got two tags I think that means it

156
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,290
it's got two tags I think that means it
 

157
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,869
it's got two tags I think that means it
has two peas inside I could be wrong

158
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
has two peas inside I could be wrong
 

159
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,330
has two peas inside I could be wrong
about that I think it for sure has at

160
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,340
about that I think it for sure has at
 

161
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,970
about that I think it for sure has at
least one though okay and then let's go

162
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:35,980
least one though okay and then let's go
 

163
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,849
least one though okay and then let's go
get this other nest here

164
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:37,859
get this other nest here
 

165
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,990
get this other nest here
let's fly around a little bit see if

166
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
let's fly around a little bit see if
 

167
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,119
let's fly around a little bit see if
there's any more bees flying around

168
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,129

 

169
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,559

because if we grab it before they return

170
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:46,569
because if we grab it before they return
 

171
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,990
because if we grab it before they return
home then we're not gonna get those bees

172
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,000
home then we're not gonna get those bees
 

173
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,009
home then we're not gonna get those bees
I don't see any around so I guess we'll

174
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:53,019
I don't see any around so I guess we'll
 

175
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,770
I don't see any around so I guess we'll
just grab it see what it says Oh little

176
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:55,780
just grab it see what it says Oh little
 

177

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,100
do a couple repairs on it
all right so we might have a couple

200
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,110
all right so we might have a couple
 

201
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,320
all right so we might have a couple
problems to look into a little later

202
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,330
problems to look into a little later
 

203
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,090
problems to look into a little later
today but we're gonna focus on the B

204
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,100
today but we're gonna focus on the B
 

205
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,029
today but we're gonna focus on the B
stuff to begin with here I want to I

206
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
stuff to begin with here I want to I
 

207
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,500
stuff to begin with here I want to I
want to try set up a honey farm as soon

208
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,510
want to try set up a honey farm as soon
 

209
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,360
want to try set up a honey farm as soon
as possible so these are the hives we

210
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,370
as possible so these are the hives we
 

211
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,790
as possible so these are the hives we
got the two hives let's put them down

212
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
got the two hives let's put them down
 

213
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,540
got the two hives let's put them down
and yeah the bees came along with it I I

214
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,550
and yeah the bees came along with it I I
 

215
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,909
and yeah the bees came along with it I I
wanted to name these guys just to see if

216
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:24,919
wanted to name these guys just to see if
 

217
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,909
wanted to name these guys just to see if
there's more than one because apparently

218
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
there's more than one because apparently
 

219
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,029
there's more than one because apparently
like when they go back into the hive

220
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,039
like when they go back into the hive
 

221
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,339
like when they go back into the hive
they keep the name taken and everything

222
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:32,349
they keep the name taken and everything
 

223
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,060
they keep the name taken and everything
so that's kind of cool

224
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,070
so that's kind of cool
 

225
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,230
so that's kind of cool
we'll see if another guy comes out of

226
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,240
we'll see if another guy comes out of
 

227
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,200
we'll see if another guy comes out of
here because it says there's two tags

228
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,210
here because it says there's two tags
 

229
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,610
here because it says there's two tags
but one of those tags might just be

230
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:39,620
but one of those tags might just be
 

231
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,050
but one of those tags might just be
keeping track of like how much honey is

232
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,060
keeping track of like how much honey is
 

233
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,490
keeping track of like how much honey is
in the hive I'm not sure how that works

234
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:44,500

 

235
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,350

let's get this guy down to it yes oh

236
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360

 

237
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,490

another guy he came out like right away

238
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,500
another guy he came out like right away
 

239
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,969
another guy he came out like right away
this one not so much right oh he went

240
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:57,979
this one not so much right oh he went
 

241
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,510
this one not so much right oh he went
into the different hives I I didn't

242
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
into the different hives I I didn't
 

243
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,040
into the different hives I I didn't
expect that I thought they only used one

244
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,050
expect that I thought they only used one
 

245
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,430
expect that I thought they only used one
hive I guess they can unless he's

246
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,440
hive I guess they can unless he's
 

247
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,210
hive I guess they can unless he's
attacking the other be in there hope not

248
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,220
attacking the other be in there hope not
 

249
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,350
attacking the other be in there hope not
yeah so I actually haven't played around

250
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
yeah so I actually haven't played around
 

251
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
yeah so I actually haven't played around
much with the bees so I'm trying to

252
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:12,770
much with the bees so I'm trying to
 

253
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,210
much with the bees so I'm trying to
figure out their behavior today as well

254
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,220
figure out their behavior today as well
 

255
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,230
figure out their behavior today as well
so it's night time I don't think they're

256
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,240
so it's night time I don't think they're
 

257
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,670
so it's night time I don't think they're
gonna come out of the hive during night

258
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
gonna come out of the hive during night
 

259
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,320
gonna come out of the hive during night
so I'm gonna sleep here see if they

260
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,330
so I'm gonna sleep here see if they
 

261
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,040
so I'm gonna sleep here see if they
emerge in the morning

262
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,050

 

263
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,869

I think there's like a cool-down after

264
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:25,879
I think there's like a cool-down after
 

265
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,610
I think there's like a cool-down after
they enter the hive before they can come

266
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:27,620
they enter the hive before they can come
 

267
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:36,550
they enter the hive before they can come
out again okay I might have messed up a

268
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
out again okay I might have messed up a
 

269
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,480
out again okay I might have messed up a
little bit um accidentally picked up the

270
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,490
little bit um accidentally picked up the
 

271
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,860
little bit um accidentally picked up the
hive when happy was out of it and he

272
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:41,870
hive when happy was out of it and he
 

273
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,059
hive when happy was out of it and he
attacked me and lost his stinger um yeah

274
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:46,069
attacked me and lost his stinger um yeah
 

275
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,969
attacked me and lost his stinger um yeah
so and the other hive I grabbed was

276
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:48,979
so and the other hive I grabbed was
 

277
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,589
so and the other hive I grabbed was
empty apparently so we only had the one

278
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:50,599
empty apparently so we only had the one
 

279
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,950
empty apparently so we only had the one
bee yep so that means I am back out

280
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:53,960
bee yep so that means I am back out
 

281
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,230
bee yep so that means I am back out
exploring looking for some more beehives

282
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
exploring looking for some more beehives
 

283
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,110
exploring looking for some more beehives
and I actually found a brand new flower

284
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
and I actually found a brand new flower
 

285
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,909
and I actually found a brand new flower
for us like when I arrived the water was

286
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:00,919
for us like when I arrived the water was
 

287
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,399
for us like when I arrived the water was
flowing down and everything so I thought

288
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,409
flowing down and everything so I thought
 

289
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:06,219
flowing down and everything so I thought
okay this is it this is the gold mine

290
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:06,229
okay this is it this is the gold mine
 

291
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,529
okay this is it this is the gold mine
the B gold mine right because there's so

292
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:08,539
the B gold mine right because there's so
 

293
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,860
the B gold mine right because there's so
many trees here if everyone has a 5%

294
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:11,870
many trees here if everyone has a 5%
 

295
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,499
many trees here if everyone has a 5%
chance there should be a lot of beehives

296
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:13,509
chance there should be a lot of beehives
 

297
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,379
chance there should be a lot of beehives
but I haven't found a single one which

298
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:17,389
but I haven't found a single one which
 

299
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,230
but I haven't found a single one which
has me a little bit shocked honestly

300
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
has me a little bit shocked honestly
 

301
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,230
has me a little bit shocked honestly
because I thought they generated here

302
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,240

 

303
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,330

yeah I'm gonna have to keep looking I

304
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,340
yeah I'm gonna have to keep looking I
 

305
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,800
yeah I'm gonna have to keep looking I
guess I I don't know I'm gonna look

306
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:29,810
guess I I don't know I'm gonna look
 

307
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,570
guess I I don't know I'm gonna look
around a little bit closer just to make

308
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,580
around a little bit closer just to make
 

309
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,980
around a little bit closer just to make
sure

310
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:31,990
sure
 

311
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,480
sure
whoo-hoo all right we found another

312
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,490
whoo-hoo all right we found another
 

313
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,760
whoo-hoo all right we found another
flower forest guys this is actually a

314
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:36,770
flower forest guys this is actually a
 

315
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,360
flower forest guys this is actually a
huge one by the looks of it and I found

316
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,370
huge one by the looks of it and I found
 

317
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,399
huge one by the looks of it and I found
for sure one beehive here I saw a bee go

318
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:42,409
for sure one beehive here I saw a bee go
 

319
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,909
for sure one beehive here I saw a bee go
inside it so we got at least one bee

320
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
inside it so we got at least one bee
 

321
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,879
inside it so we got at least one bee
what's this firm move a bee nest with

322
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:48,889
what's this firm move a bee nest with
 

323
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,649
what's this firm move a bee nest with
three bees inside oh it tells you if you

324
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:50,659
three bees inside oh it tells you if you
 

325
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,439
three bees inside oh it tells you if you
get a triple okay so that's all we

326
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:53,449
get a triple okay so that's all we
 

327
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,379
get a triple okay so that's all we
really need then we just need three well

328
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:56,389
really need then we just need three well
 

329
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,540
really need then we just need three well
we only need two so we can we can breed

330
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,550
we only need two so we can we can breed
 

331
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,519
we only need two so we can we can breed
them right but I'm gonna look around for

332
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:00,529
them right but I'm gonna look around for
 

333
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,620
them right but I'm gonna look around for
more hives since I've come all this way

334
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:02,630
more hives since I've come all this way
 

335
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,219
more hives since I've come all this way
we are about 8,000 blocks out away from

336
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:06,229
we are about 8,000 blocks out away from
 

337
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,269
we are about 8,000 blocks out away from
our our home base yes got another one

338
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:09,279
our our home base yes got another one
 

339
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,110
our our home base yes got another one
found another one I decided just to

340
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,120
found another one I decided just to
 

341
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,610
found another one I decided just to
sleep here I think I went through the

342
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:15,620
sleep here I think I went through the
 

343
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,670
sleep here I think I went through the
whole biome and I only found three but

344
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:18,680
whole biome and I only found three but
 

345
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,439
whole biome and I only found three but
if it's daytime they might be easier to

346
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,449
if it's daytime they might be easier to
 

347
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,990
if it's daytime they might be easier to
spot as they fly around out of the hive

348
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,000
spot as they fly around out of the hive
 

349
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,129
spot as they fly around out of the hive
oh yeah they're rare they're definitely

350
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:27,139
oh yeah they're rare they're definitely
 

351
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,800
oh yeah they're rare they're definitely
pretty rare Oh check it out it is a

352
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:29,810
pretty rare Oh check it out it is a
 

353
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,050
pretty rare Oh check it out it is a
birch tree one so they can spawn in

354
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,060
birch tree one so they can spawn in
 

355
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,069
birch tree one so they can spawn in
birch trees not just oak trees awesome

356
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:36,079
birch trees not just oak trees awesome
 

357
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,079
birch trees not just oak trees awesome
alright so we're back

358
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:37,089
alright so we're back
 

359
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,360
alright so we're back
home again but we brought with us check

360
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,370
home again but we brought with us check
 

361
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,759
home again but we brought with us check
this out six beehives from that one

362
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:41,769
this out six beehives from that one
 

363
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,069
this out six beehives from that one
biome the first flower forest we found

364
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:44,079
biome the first flower forest we found
 

365
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,860
biome the first flower forest we found
had none but that other one was huge and

366
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:46,870
had none but that other one was huge and
 

367
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,350
had none but that other one was huge and
we did pretty good there so our first

368
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
we did pretty good there so our first
 

369
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,670
we did pretty good there so our first
goal here I just want to get our

370
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:50,680
goal here I just want to get our
 

371
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,220
goal here I just want to get our
population of bees up that's like the

372
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,230
population of bees up that's like the
 

373
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,710
population of bees up that's like the
main thing to do so you can apparently

374
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,720
main thing to do so you can apparently
 

375
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,980
main thing to do so you can apparently
breed them if you hold the flower yeah

376
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:58,990
breed them if you hold the flower yeah
 

377
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,720
breed them if you hold the flower yeah
they come and kind of and follow you

378
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:00,730
they come and kind of and follow you
 

379
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,069
they come and kind of and follow you
around which is cool they eat flowers

380
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:04,079
around which is cool they eat flowers
 

381
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:10,290
around which is cool they eat flowers
and yeah we got a baby bee and you can

382
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,300
and yeah we got a baby bee and you can
 

383
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,699
and yeah we got a baby bee and you can
feed them flowers to make them grow up

384
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:11,709
feed them flowers to make them grow up
 

385
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,269
feed them flowers to make them grow up
faster too which is cool

386
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
faster too which is cool
 

387
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,610
faster too which is cool
so I think it's very important as we're

388
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:17,620
so I think it's very important as we're
 

389
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,710
so I think it's very important as we're
doing this not to put all our bees in

390
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:19,720
doing this not to put all our bees in
 

391
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,480
doing this not to put all our bees in
one basket because I think if I pick up

392
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,490
one basket because I think if I pick up
 

393
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,670
one basket because I think if I pick up
a hive and they're all gonna attack me

394
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
a hive and they're all gonna attack me
 

395
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,019
a hive and they're all gonna attack me
they'll all lose their stingers and

396
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:25,029
they'll all lose their stingers and
 

397
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,030
they'll all lose their stingers and
they'll all die so we want to have like

398
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
they'll all die so we want to have like
 

399
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,619
they'll all die so we want to have like
a couple different colonies around our

400
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:28,629
a couple different colonies around our
 

401
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,549
a couple different colonies around our
our place just in case I mess up again

402
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:31,559
our place just in case I mess up again
 

403
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:39,980
our place just in case I mess up again
will you eat more bigger though

404
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:39,990

 

405
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,010

I don't think he is very good very good

406
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,020
I don't think he is very good very good
 

407
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,570
I don't think he is very good very good
so we're making some good progress here

408
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:44,580
so we're making some good progress here
 

409
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,280
so we're making some good progress here
I put down a couple more of the hives

410
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,290
I put down a couple more of the hives
 

411
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,140
I put down a couple more of the hives
but I'm gonna save these three just in

412
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,150
but I'm gonna save these three just in
 

413
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,690
but I'm gonna save these three just in
case I make a mistake I don't want to

414
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:50,700
case I make a mistake I don't want to
 

415
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,860
case I make a mistake I don't want to
lose everything and have to go look for

416
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:51,870
lose everything and have to go look for
 

417
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,650
lose everything and have to go look for
more so I put down two more and they had

418
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:54,660
more so I put down two more and they had
 

419
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,200
more so I put down two more and they had
two in each so that's six starter bees

420
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,210
two in each so that's six starter bees
 

421
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,690
two in each so that's six starter bees
and I've read them I think four times or

422
00:09:59,690 --> 00:09:59,700
and I've read them I think four times or
 

423
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,660
and I've read them I think four times or
so some of the bees they went over

424
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:02,670
so some of the bees they went over
 

425
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,400
so some of the bees they went over
towards this forest here and they never

426
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,410
towards this forest here and they never
 

427
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,160
towards this forest here and they never
came back even at night time like they

428
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,170
came back even at night time like they
 

429
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,240
came back even at night time like they
just stayed out there

430
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,250
just stayed out there
 

431
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,340
just stayed out there
I think they died a few of them I

432
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,350
I think they died a few of them I
 

433
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,990
I think they died a few of them I
noticed like when some of them flew over

434
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
noticed like when some of them flew over
 

435
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,780
noticed like when some of them flew over
the water they took damage so I don't

436
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:14,790
the water they took damage so I don't
 

437
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,100
the water they took damage so I don't
think they do too well out from the wild

438
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,110
think they do too well out from the wild
 

439
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,450
think they do too well out from the wild
yeah we have a few bees in our hive here

440
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,460
yeah we have a few bees in our hive here
 

441
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,590
yeah we have a few bees in our hive here
and you can see they're starting to fill

442
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
and you can see they're starting to fill
 

443
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,330
and you can see they're starting to fill
up with honey when it turns yellow like

444
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,340
up with honey when it turns yellow like
 

445
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,210
up with honey when it turns yellow like
this that means it's full they pollinate

446
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,220
this that means it's full they pollinate
 

447
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,340
this that means it's full they pollinate
it at least five times and you can see

448
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,350
it at least five times and you can see
 

449
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,810
it at least five times and you can see
it starts dripping honey like that too

450
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:32,820
it starts dripping honey like that too
 

451
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,120
it starts dripping honey like that too
underneath so that's cool now I think

452
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,130
underneath so that's cool now I think
 

453
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,250
underneath so that's cool now I think
there is some redstone stuff we can do

454
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,260
there is some redstone stuff we can do
 

455
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,080
there is some redstone stuff we can do
with this too so let's just check that

456
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,090
with this too so let's just check that
 

457
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,500
with this too so let's just check that
out

458
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,510
out
 

459
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,390
out
I think we can hook comparators up to

460
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,400
I think we can hook comparators up to
 

461
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,630
I think we can hook comparators up to
this I think we can use observers

462
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
this I think we can use observers
 

463
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,350
this I think we can use observers
oh yeah and dispensers we can use

464
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,360
oh yeah and dispensers we can use
 

465
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,870
oh yeah and dispensers we can use
dispensers which is also pretty pretty

466
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
dispensers which is also pretty pretty
 

467
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,480
dispensers which is also pretty pretty
awesome spencer's let's grab some

468
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,490
awesome spencer's let's grab some
 

469
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,570
awesome spencer's let's grab some
bottles and shears and just play around

470
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:56,580
bottles and shears and just play around
 

471
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,210
bottles and shears and just play around
with this a little bit so we can see how

472
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,220
with this a little bit so we can see how
 

473
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,720
with this a little bit so we can see how
much honey is in here by how far the

474
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,730
much honey is in here by how far the
 

475
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,280
much honey is in here by how far the
signal goes so I think if it's at five

476
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,290
signal goes so I think if it's at five
 

477
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,150
signal goes so I think if it's at five
its full while like this one we can see

478
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
its full while like this one we can see
 

479
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,220
its full while like this one we can see
isn't full just by looking at it let's

480
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,230
isn't full just by looking at it let's
 

481
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,450
isn't full just by looking at it let's
see what it the Redstone says u3 so that

482
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,460
see what it the Redstone says u3 so that
 

483
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,710
see what it the Redstone says u3 so that
only goes up to three right now uh-huh I

484
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:17,720
only goes up to three right now uh-huh I
 

485
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,610
only goes up to three right now uh-huh I
don't know I don't think you can check

486
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:19,620
don't know I don't think you can check
 

487
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,710
don't know I don't think you can check
how many bees are inside though I don't

488
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
how many bees are inside though I don't
 

489
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,700
how many bees are inside though I don't
think that's possible so we can we and

490
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,710
think that's possible so we can we and
 

491
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,060
think that's possible so we can we and
harvest these hives if we cook them with

492
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,070
harvest these hives if we cook them with
 

493
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,410
harvest these hives if we cook them with
a bottle we'll get honey if we cook

494
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:30,420
a bottle we'll get honey if we cook
 

495
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,970
a bottle we'll get honey if we cook
click on my shears we get honeycomb but

496
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:33,980
click on my shears we get honeycomb but
 

497
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,380
click on my shears we get honeycomb but
we need a campfire underneath if we

498
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,390
we need a campfire underneath if we
 

499
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,270
we need a campfire underneath if we
harvest them ourselves otherwise the

500
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,280
harvest them ourselves otherwise the
 

501
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,510
harvest them ourselves otherwise the
bees will attack us I think so one way

502
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:41,520
bees will attack us I think so one way
 

503
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,770
bees will attack us I think so one way
around that though is just to use

504
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:42,780
around that though is just to use
 

505
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,490
around that though is just to use
dispensers if the dispenser does the job

506
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,500
dispensers if the dispenser does the job
 

507
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,380
dispensers if the dispenser does the job
for us they'll leave us alone I think so

508
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,390
for us they'll leave us alone I think so
 

509
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,670
for us they'll leave us alone I think so
I'm gonna try to get some honeycomb if

510
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm gonna try to get some honeycomb if
 

511
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm gonna try to get some honeycomb if
we put some shears in there and this is

512
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:51,810
we put some shears in there and this is
 

513
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,010
we put some shears in there and this is
full

514
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,020
full
 

515
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,930
full
we should get it I hope they don't

516
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:54,940
we should get it I hope they don't
 

517
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,020
we should get it I hope they don't
attack me they didn't okay cool so then

518
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,030
attack me they didn't okay cool so then
 

519
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,050
attack me they didn't okay cool so then
you see we got honeycomb ona gives us

520
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,060
you see we got honeycomb ona gives us
 

521
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,790
you see we got honeycomb ona gives us
gives us three each that's pretty good

522
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
gives us three each that's pretty good
 

523
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,240
gives us three each that's pretty good
that's what we need to make our own hive

524
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,250
that's what we need to make our own hive
 

525
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,710
that's what we need to make our own hive
so yeah there's wild hives and then

526
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:07,720
so yeah there's wild hives and then
 

527
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,800
so yeah there's wild hives and then
there's custom homemade ones right

528
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:11,810
there's custom homemade ones right
 

529
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,629
there's custom homemade ones right
would she make like that so that's

530
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:13,639
would she make like that so that's
 

531
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,850
would she make like that so that's
that's our own beehives and I think they

532
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:15,860
that's our own beehives and I think they
 

533
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,519
that's our own beehives and I think they
function pretty much exactly the same it

534
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:18,529
function pretty much exactly the same it
 

535
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,900
function pretty much exactly the same it
would be kind of cool T to give the bees

536
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:19,910
would be kind of cool T to give the bees
 

537
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,369
would be kind of cool T to give the bees
paper or something so that they could

538
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:21,379
paper or something so that they could
 

539
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,710
paper or something so that they could
make their own hives like if they can't

540
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:23,720
make their own hives like if they can't
 

541
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,119
make their own hives like if they can't
find one and it's turning nighttime

542
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,129
find one and it's turning nighttime
 

543
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,920
find one and it's turning nighttime
maybe they they could make their own and

544
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:26,930
maybe they they could make their own and
 

545
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,679
maybe they they could make their own and
then this block would be farmable but as

546
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:29,689
then this block would be farmable but as
 

547
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:30,970
then this block would be farmable but as
is right now I think you can only get

548
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:30,980
is right now I think you can only get
 

549
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,340
is right now I think you can only get
these out in the wild but these you may

550
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,350
these out in the wild but these you may
 

551
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,720
these out in the wild but these you may
get as many as you want and these also I

552
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:37,730
get as many as you want and these also I
 

553
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,309
get as many as you want and these also I
think get comparator signals and stuff

554
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:39,319
think get comparator signals and stuff
 

555
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,980
think get comparator signals and stuff
so that's cool look that up to test it

556
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:41,990
so that's cool look that up to test it
 

557
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,340
so that's cool look that up to test it
out

558
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,350
out
 

559
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,230
out
let's try put some bottles in this one

560
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
let's try put some bottles in this one
 

561
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
let's try put some bottles in this one
just to make sure that works oh that was

562
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:48,649
just to make sure that works oh that was
 

563
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,639
just to make sure that works oh that was
weird the B popped out for a sec oh yeah

564
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:51,649
weird the B popped out for a sec oh yeah
 

565
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,199
weird the B popped out for a sec oh yeah
and it puts the honey bottle in the

566
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:53,209
and it puts the honey bottle in the
 

567
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,739
and it puts the honey bottle in the
dispenser cool cool what happens if it

568
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:56,749
dispenser cool cool what happens if it
 

569
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,319
dispenser cool cool what happens if it
is full as my question does it shoot the

570
00:12:59,319 --> 00:12:59,329
is full as my question does it shoot the
 

571
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,650
is full as my question does it shoot the
honey bottle out then and if it does

572
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:02,660
honey bottle out then and if it does
 

573
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,650
honey bottle out then and if it does
that'll make farming this a lot easier

574
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:07,660
that'll make farming this a lot easier
 

575
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,579
that'll make farming this a lot easier
because then you don't have to filter

576
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:09,589
because then you don't have to filter
 

577
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,249
because then you don't have to filter
out the honey bottles right it'll shoot

578
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:12,259
out the honey bottles right it'll shoot
 

579
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,150
out the honey bottles right it'll shoot
out oh it did shoot out okay yeah that's

580
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
out oh it did shoot out okay yeah that's
 

581
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,040
out oh it did shoot out okay yeah that's
that's gonna be handy very cool and you

582
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,050
that's gonna be handy very cool and you
 

583
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,509
that's gonna be handy very cool and you
see the signal strength goes back to

584
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:22,519
see the signal strength goes back to
 

585
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,179
see the signal strength goes back to
zero so another pretty cool thing about

586
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,189
zero so another pretty cool thing about
 

587
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,249
zero so another pretty cool thing about
the bees is after they pollinate some

588
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:27,259
the bees is after they pollinate some
 

589
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,110
the bees is after they pollinate some
flowers they will actually drop the

590
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
flowers they will actually drop the
 

591
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,290
flowers they will actually drop the
pollen as they fly around so you can see

592
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:32,300
pollen as they fly around so you can see
 

593
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,759
pollen as they fly around so you can see
this guy he's full of pollen and he's

594
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:33,769
this guy he's full of pollen and he's
 

595
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,710
this guy he's full of pollen and he's
he's dropping these particles every so

596
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:35,720
he's dropping these particles every so
 

597
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,600
he's dropping these particles every so
often and look at that whenever they fly

598
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,610
often and look at that whenever they fly
 

599
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,749
often and look at that whenever they fly
over your crops they will advance them

600
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:40,759
over your crops they will advance them
 

601
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,019
over your crops they will advance them
at growth stage which is pretty cool you

602
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:44,029
at growth stage which is pretty cool you
 

603
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,610
at growth stage which is pretty cool you
might be able to do some neat stuff with

604
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:45,620
might be able to do some neat stuff with
 

605
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,720
might be able to do some neat stuff with
that I'm wondering if you can put them

606
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:46,730
that I'm wondering if you can put them
 

607
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,110
that I'm wondering if you can put them
in like minecarts and force them over

608
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,120
in like minecarts and force them over
 

609
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,299
in like minecarts and force them over
your crops or something I don't know I

610
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:52,309
your crops or something I don't know I
 

611
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,309
your crops or something I don't know I
kind of suspect it doesn't do it very

612
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:54,319
kind of suspect it doesn't do it very
 

613
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:58,449
kind of suspect it doesn't do it very
much is the problem cuz I'm like hold on

614
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:58,459
much is the problem cuz I'm like hold on
 

615
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,610
much is the problem cuz I'm like hold on
this guy here and he's he's not really

616
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:00,620
this guy here and he's he's not really
 

617
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,419
this guy here and he's he's not really
growing the crops too much it's probably

618
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:04,429
growing the crops too much it's probably
 

619
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,369
growing the crops too much it's probably
just like every once in a while right oh

620
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:06,379
just like every once in a while right oh
 

621
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,710
just like every once in a while right oh
there we go again

622
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:07,720
there we go again
 

623
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,960
there we go again
like maybe every 20 seconds or something

624
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:10,970
like maybe every 20 seconds or something
 

625
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,590
like maybe every 20 seconds or something
I was the guest maybe fifteen seconds oh

626
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
I was the guest maybe fifteen seconds oh
 

627
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,549
I was the guest maybe fifteen seconds oh
I think that might have been from the

628
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:15,559
I think that might have been from the
 

629
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,930
I think that might have been from the
other guy

630
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:16,940
other guy
 

631
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,590
other guy
oh I messed up again I placed down one

632
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:20,600
oh I messed up again I placed down one
 

633
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,450
oh I messed up again I placed down one
of my own homemade hives and picked it

634
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:22,460
of my own homemade hives and picked it
 

635
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,270
of my own homemade hives and picked it
up not thinking and a bunch of them came

636
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,280
up not thinking and a bunch of them came
 

637
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,620
up not thinking and a bunch of them came
after me and stung me and now they're

638
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:26,630
after me and stung me and now they're
 

639
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,210
after me and stung me and now they're
gonna die oh there goes one ah that

640
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,220
gonna die oh there goes one ah that
 

641
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,540
gonna die oh there goes one ah that
sucks

642
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:32,550
sucks
 

643
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,510
sucks
looks like they calm down so if they get

644
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:35,520
looks like they calm down so if they get
 

645
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,060
looks like they calm down so if they get
mad just run away from them if they

646
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,070
mad just run away from them if they
 

647
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,380
mad just run away from them if they
don't sting you they won't they won't

648
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,390
don't sting you they won't they won't
 

649
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,510
don't sting you they won't they won't
kill themselves like this guy he was mad

650
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:41,520
kill themselves like this guy he was mad
 

651
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,670
kill themselves like this guy he was mad
at me but he never stung me so he's he's

652
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
at me but he never stung me so he's he's
 

653
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,490
at me but he never stung me so he's he's
gonna be fine he still has a stinger

654
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:45,500
gonna be fine he still has a stinger
 

655
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,480
gonna be fine he still has a stinger
alright everybody so I've been goofing

656
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,490
alright everybody so I've been goofing
 

657
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,770
alright everybody so I've been goofing
around a little bit here just starting

658
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:48,780
around a little bit here just starting
 

659
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,300
around a little bit here just starting
to figure a few things out with the bees

660
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,310
to figure a few things out with the bees
 

661
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,600
to figure a few things out with the bees
let me show you a couple things so I

662
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:53,610
let me show you a couple things so I
 

663
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,190
let me show you a couple things so I
tried building one of these I got two

664
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,200
tried building one of these I got two
 

665
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,990
tried building one of these I got two
bees inside a little holding area here I

666
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,000
bees inside a little holding area here I
 

667
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,730
bees inside a little holding area here I
just want to see like the baby bee can

668
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,740
just want to see like the baby bee can
 

669
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,650
just want to see like the baby bee can
escape like these guys are too big and

670
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:00,660
escape like these guys are too big and
 

671
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,400
escape like these guys are too big and
chunky to get out of there we'll bring

672
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,410
chunky to get out of there we'll bring
 

673
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,850
chunky to get out of there we'll bring
them together see if that works it'll be

674
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:07,860
them together see if that works it'll be
 

675
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,350
them together see if that works it'll be
small enough to get out yeah so if we

676
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
small enough to get out yeah so if we
 

677
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,680
small enough to get out yeah so if we
want to make like a breeding area that

678
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:12,690
want to make like a breeding area that
 

679
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,480
want to make like a breeding area that
works pretty good that's pretty simple

680
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,490
works pretty good that's pretty simple
 

681
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,100
works pretty good that's pretty simple
let's see I think I think if you're

682
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,110
let's see I think I think if you're
 

683
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,260
let's see I think I think if you're
trying to do a bee farm like this is

684
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,270
trying to do a bee farm like this is
 

685
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,270
trying to do a bee farm like this is
probably the simplest and best method of

686
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,280
probably the simplest and best method of
 

687
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,250
probably the simplest and best method of
doing it just hook up a comparator to

688
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,260
doing it just hook up a comparator to
 

689
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,560
doing it just hook up a comparator to
the bee hive when it gets totally full

690
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:27,570
the bee hive when it gets totally full
 

691
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,330
the bee hive when it gets totally full
the signal will go five blocks into a

692
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,340
the signal will go five blocks into a
 

693
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,590
the signal will go five blocks into a
dispenser aimed at the hive and then you

694
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
dispenser aimed at the hive and then you
 

695
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
dispenser aimed at the hive and then you
can put foot either shears or your or

696
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,050
can put foot either shears or your or
 

697
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,420
can put foot either shears or your or
your glass bottles in there let's use

698
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,430
your glass bottles in there let's use
 

699
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,120
your glass bottles in there let's use
glass bottles as our example here so I

700
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,130
glass bottles as our example here so I
 

701
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,310
glass bottles as our example here so I
think what I would do is just fill that

702
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,320
think what I would do is just fill that
 

703
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,520
think what I would do is just fill that
up with the filter that way our glass

704
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,530
up with the filter that way our glass
 

705
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,310
up with the filter that way our glass
bottles will stay in the dispenser and

706
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
bottles will stay in the dispenser and
 

707
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,200
bottles will stay in the dispenser and
then whenever this goes five blocks the

708
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,210
then whenever this goes five blocks the
 

709
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,690
then whenever this goes five blocks the
honey bottle will go in here and down

710
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:56,700
honey bottle will go in here and down
 

711
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
honey bottle will go in here and down
into here alright so you just gotta put

712
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:58,710
into here alright so you just gotta put
 

713
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,280
into here alright so you just gotta put
like five empty or five stacks of the

714
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,290
like five empty or five stacks of the
 

715
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,290
like five empty or five stacks of the
glass bottles in here and eventually

716
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:03,300
glass bottles in here and eventually
 

717
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,180
glass bottles in here and eventually
I'll end up with five full ones down

718
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,190
I'll end up with five full ones down
 

719
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,440
I'll end up with five full ones down
here so that's pretty simple on a larger

720
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,450
here so that's pretty simple on a larger
 

721
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,210
here so that's pretty simple on a larger
scale I wouldn't use this method I don't

722
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,220
scale I wouldn't use this method I don't
 

723
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,060
scale I wouldn't use this method I don't
think the problem is if we go for

724
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,070
think the problem is if we go for
 

725
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,650
think the problem is if we go for
redstone it takes up quite a bit of

726
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:15,660
redstone it takes up quite a bit of
 

727
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,010
redstone it takes up quite a bit of
space like to do this also red stones a

728
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,020
space like to do this also red stones a
 

729
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,450
space like to do this also red stones a
little bit lady in the game it's better

730
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:20,460
little bit lady in the game it's better
 

731
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,240
little bit lady in the game it's better
to avoid using it and this is not all

732
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,250
to avoid using it and this is not all
 

733
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,020
to avoid using it and this is not all
that easy to tile as well I think if we

734
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,030
that easy to tile as well I think if we
 

735
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,580
that easy to tile as well I think if we
want to go for a larger scale firm

736
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:28,590
want to go for a larger scale firm
 

737
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,830
want to go for a larger scale firm
observers are gonna be the way to do it

738
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:30,840
observers are gonna be the way to do it
 

739
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,050
observers are gonna be the way to do it
like look at this this is something we

740
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,060
like look at this this is something we
 

741
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,560
like look at this this is something we
could do this method would allow us to

742
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,570
could do this method would allow us to
 

743
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,840
could do this method would allow us to
put the beehives side-by-side it's

744
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:38,850
put the beehives side-by-side it's
 

745
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,580
put the beehives side-by-side it's
easily tileable right

746
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,590
easily tileable right
 

747
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,820
easily tileable right
no redstone dust but there's definitely

748
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:43,830
no redstone dust but there's definitely
 

749
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,620
no redstone dust but there's definitely
a couple problems with this method as

750
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:45,630
a couple problems with this method as
 

751
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,190
a couple problems with this method as
well

752
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,200
well
 

753
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,680
well
the idea is this chain here is where we

754
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:48,690
the idea is this chain here is where we
 

755
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,620
the idea is this chain here is where we
feed our glass bottles and we keep that

756
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:51,630
feed our glass bottles and we keep that
 

757
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,720
feed our glass bottles and we keep that
full and they'll they'll get distributed

758
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:53,730
full and they'll they'll get distributed
 

759
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,940
full and they'll they'll get distributed
to all these dispensers right so that's

760
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:55,950
to all these dispensers right so that's
 

761
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,460
to all these dispensers right so that's
good that's simple and then we want

762
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,470
good that's simple and then we want
 

763
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,320
good that's simple and then we want
these totally filled up these dispensers

764
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,330
these totally filled up these dispensers
 

765
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,910
these totally filled up these dispensers
that way the honey bottle gets shot out

766
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:04,920
that way the honey bottle gets shot out
 

767
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,440
that way the honey bottle gets shot out
and they may all get picked up by the

768
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,450
and they may all get picked up by the
 

769
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,620
and they may all get picked up by the
hoppers below that works apparently I've

770
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,630
hoppers below that works apparently I've
 

771
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,300
hoppers below that works apparently I've
been testing it out seems to be pretty

772
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,310
been testing it out seems to be pretty
 

773
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,030
been testing it out seems to be pretty
good there there's a couple issues

774
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,040
good there there's a couple issues
 

775
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,360
good there there's a couple issues
though yeah that's actually let's take

776
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:17,370
though yeah that's actually let's take
 

777
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,640
though yeah that's actually let's take
these back out just make sure these are

778
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:19,650
these back out just make sure these are
 

779
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,699
these back out just make sure these are
kind of full all right so if we trigger

780
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:22,709
kind of full all right so if we trigger
 

781
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,449
kind of full all right so if we trigger
that like whenever honey goes into the

782
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,459
that like whenever honey goes into the
 

783
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,980
that like whenever honey goes into the
hive here it's gonna trigger the

784
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:27,990
hive here it's gonna trigger the
 

785
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,560
hive here it's gonna trigger the
observer flip the trapdoor go down into

786
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:30,570
observer flip the trapdoor go down into
 

787
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,660
observer flip the trapdoor go down into
the dispenser it'll shoot out a glass

788
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:32,670
the dispenser it'll shoot out a glass
 

789
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,840
the dispenser it'll shoot out a glass
bottle which will end up in here now

790
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:35,850
bottle which will end up in here now
 

791
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,020
bottle which will end up in here now
four out of the five times this hive is

792
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,030
four out of the five times this hive is
 

793
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,460
four out of the five times this hive is
not gonna have honey in it is the

794
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,470
not gonna have honey in it is the
 

795
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,410
not gonna have honey in it is the
problem that means it's gonna shoot

796
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,420
problem that means it's gonna shoot
 

797
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,170
problem that means it's gonna shoot
glass bottles into the hopper here and

798
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:45,180
glass bottles into the hopper here and
 

799
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,090
glass bottles into the hopper here and
we don't really want that to happen but

800
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,100
we don't really want that to happen but
 

801
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,770
we don't really want that to happen but
we can't really avoid that unless we use

802
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:48,780
we can't really avoid that unless we use
 

803
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,240
we can't really avoid that unless we use
the redstone method which will be

804
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,250
the redstone method which will be
 

805
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,790
the redstone method which will be
bulkier so we're gonna have to send

806
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:52,800
bulkier so we're gonna have to send
 

807
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,410
bulkier so we're gonna have to send
those we're gonna have to filter those

808
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,420
those we're gonna have to filter those
 

809
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,810
those we're gonna have to filter those
bottles from the full ones and then send

810
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:56,820
bottles from the full ones and then send
 

811
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,600
bottles from the full ones and then send
the empty ones back into this chain

812
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:58,610
the empty ones back into this chain
 

813
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,940
the empty ones back into this chain
which isn't a big deal I don't think the

814
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:01,950
which isn't a big deal I don't think the
 

815
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,310
which isn't a big deal I don't think the
other thing is though the way we got

816
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
other thing is though the way we got
 

817
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,410
other thing is though the way we got
this laid out

818
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:05,420
this laid out
 

819
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,130
this laid out
you see we two bottles went in here

820
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,140
you see we two bottles went in here
 

821
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,160
you see we two bottles went in here
trigger again two more go in two more so

822
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,170
trigger again two more go in two more so
 

823
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,680
trigger again two more go in two more so
what's happening is the observer is over

824
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:15,690
what's happening is the observer is over
 

825
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,570
what's happening is the observer is over
here going down to the dispenser it also

826
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:17,580
here going down to the dispenser it also
 

827
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,150
here going down to the dispenser it also
triggers the one next to it so if that's

828
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
triggers the one next to it so if that's
 

829
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,800
triggers the one next to it so if that's
in the middle it's gonna trigger the

830
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:21,810
in the middle it's gonna trigger the
 

831
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,660
in the middle it's gonna trigger the
middle one the one to the right and the

832
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:23,670
middle one the one to the right and the
 

833
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,430
middle one the one to the right and the
one to the left so that's three bottles

834
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
one to the left so that's three bottles
 

835
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,330
one to the left so that's three bottles
per trigger so times four four out of

836
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,340
per trigger so times four four out of
 

837
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,730
per trigger so times four four out of
the five times are gonna be empty glass

838
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:31,740
the five times are gonna be empty glass
 

839
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,370
the five times are gonna be empty glass
bottles we don't want that's twelve

840
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,380
bottles we don't want that's twelve
 

841
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,700
bottles we don't want that's twelve
glass bottles which we'll have to send

842
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:37,710
glass bottles which we'll have to send
 

843
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,040
glass bottles which we'll have to send
back into here that's not great so what

844
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,050
back into here that's not great so what
 

845
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,600
back into here that's not great so what
we can do is that I just changed the

846
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,610
we can do is that I just changed the
 

847
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,520
we can do is that I just changed the
pattern a little bit so that this

848
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,530
pattern a little bit so that this
 

849
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,590
pattern a little bit so that this
observer goes into a block before the

850
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
observer goes into a block before the
 

851
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,430
observer goes into a block before the
Descent this dispenser here that way it

852
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
Descent this dispenser here that way it
 

853
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,500
Descent this dispenser here that way it
only triggers this dispenser and not the

854
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,510
only triggers this dispenser and not the
 

855
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,620
only triggers this dispenser and not the
one next to it here so that's a little

856
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,630
one next to it here so that's a little
 

857
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,299
one next to it here so that's a little
bit better but a little bit bulkier

858
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:58,309

 

859
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,960

you see it's still at 30 there all right

860
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:01,970
you see it's still at 30 there all right
 

861
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,700
you see it's still at 30 there all right
but this one this one's gonna get

862
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:03,710
but this one this one's gonna get
 

863
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:10,149
but this one this one's gonna get
activated only one time I think that's a

864
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,159
activated only one time I think that's a
 

865
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,860
activated only one time I think that's a
little bit better I like this more than

866
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:11,870
little bit better I like this more than
 

867
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,659
little bit better I like this more than
then this style even though this one's

868
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:13,669
then this style even though this one's
 

869
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:19,180
then this style even though this one's
more compact let's see there's another

870
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,190
more compact let's see there's another
 

871
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,520
more compact let's see there's another
problem I noticed as well though

872
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,530
problem I noticed as well though
 

873
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,460
problem I noticed as well though
let's just play around with that so if

874
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,470
let's just play around with that so if
 

875
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,890
let's just play around with that so if
we we have a bunch of stuff in here

876
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:28,900
we we have a bunch of stuff in here
 

877
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,230
we we have a bunch of stuff in here
and we trigger it quickly like if we do

878
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
and we trigger it quickly like if we do
 

879
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,690
and we trigger it quickly like if we do
it slowly it's fine it'll always go into

880
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:34,700
it slowly it's fine it'll always go into
 

881
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,810
it slowly it's fine it'll always go into
the hopper but I noticed if I trigger it

882
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:37,820
the hopper but I noticed if I trigger it
 

883
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,549
the hopper but I noticed if I trigger it
quicker it's like the hopper can't keep

884
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:39,559
quicker it's like the hopper can't keep
 

885
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,399
quicker it's like the hopper can't keep
up and then they start shooting out past

886
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:42,409
up and then they start shooting out past
 

887
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,779
up and then they start shooting out past
it alright like this is fine if we go

888
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:46,789
it alright like this is fine if we go
 

889
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,590
it alright like this is fine if we go
slow if we start you start going a

890
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,600
slow if we start you start going a
 

891
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,730
slow if we start you start going a
little bit quicker they start shooting

892
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:51,740
little bit quicker they start shooting
 

893
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,430
little bit quicker they start shooting
out so that's one thing to keep in mind

894
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,440
out so that's one thing to keep in mind
 

895
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,590
out so that's one thing to keep in mind
with this design as well okay so I'd

896
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:56,600
with this design as well okay so I'd
 

897
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,180
with this design as well okay so I'd
like to be in this little area here I

898
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,190
like to be in this little area here I
 

899
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,850
like to be in this little area here I
wanted to start testing this thing out

900
00:19:59,850 --> 00:19:59,860
wanted to start testing this thing out
 

901
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,830
wanted to start testing this thing out
but he's not doing anything like I don't

902
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:02,840
but he's not doing anything like I don't
 

903
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,600
but he's not doing anything like I don't
I don't even think he has pollen and he

904
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:04,610
I don't even think he has pollen and he
 

905
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,710
I don't even think he has pollen and he
won't grab from the flower here so I'm

906
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
won't grab from the flower here so I'm
 

907
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,090
won't grab from the flower here so I'm
not sure what's up with that he might

908
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,100
not sure what's up with that he might
 

909
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,710
not sure what's up with that he might
belong to a different hive that he's

910
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
belong to a different hive that he's
 

911
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,710
belong to a different hive that he's
trying to get bad to or something

912
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:13,720
trying to get bad to or something
 

913
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,510
trying to get bad to or something
he might need more space I'm just gonna

914
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:16,520
he might need more space I'm just gonna
 

915
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,279
he might need more space I'm just gonna
watch him now that's nighttime I'll see

916
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:18,289
watch him now that's nighttime I'll see
 

917
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,720
watch him now that's nighttime I'll see
if he goes into this high because he's

918
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:19,730
if he goes into this high because he's
 

919
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,510
if he goes into this high because he's
just been flying here all day yeah even

920
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,520
just been flying here all day yeah even
 

921
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,070
just been flying here all day yeah even
at nighttime he won't go into the hive

922
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
at nighttime he won't go into the hive
 

923
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,899
at nighttime he won't go into the hive
here there's a few other bees still

924
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:25,909
here there's a few other bees still
 

925
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:29,289
here there's a few other bees still
flying around too so I'm not sure what

926
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:29,299
flying around too so I'm not sure what
 

927
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:30,039
flying around too so I'm not sure what
that's about

928
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,049
that's about
 

929
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,810
that's about
yeah what do we do about this I tried

930
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:31,820
yeah what do we do about this I tried
 

931
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,220
yeah what do we do about this I tried
leaving the chunks and coming back and

932
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,230
leaving the chunks and coming back and
 

933
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,169
leaving the chunks and coming back and
he's still not working this this bee is

934
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:35,179
he's still not working this this bee is
 

935
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,149
he's still not working this this bee is
on strike he's not doing a lick of work

936
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:39,159
on strike he's not doing a lick of work
 

937
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,440
on strike he's not doing a lick of work
maybe let's try to give him a little

938
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,450
maybe let's try to give him a little
 

939
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,190
maybe let's try to give him a little
more space if that'll fix it I'll bust

940
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
more space if that'll fix it I'll bust
 

941
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,330
more space if that'll fix it I'll bust
this out so he can fly up

942
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,340

 

943
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,320

he's still just trying to get out of

944
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,330
he's still just trying to get out of
 

945
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,490
he's still just trying to get out of
there you guys I want to be in there

946
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:54,500
there you guys I want to be in there
 

947
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,080
there you guys I want to be in there
it's a flower right below you and a hive

948
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,090
it's a flower right below you and a hive
 

949
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,850
it's a flower right below you and a hive
you got everything you want

950
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:58,860
you got everything you want
 

951
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,150
you got everything you want
look what more could you want in life

952
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,160
look what more could you want in life
 

953
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,770
look what more could you want in life
okay maybe let's try a little test with

954
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:03,780
okay maybe let's try a little test with
 

955
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,890
okay maybe let's try a little test with
these two again let's put a beehive over

956
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:06,900
these two again let's put a beehive over
 

957
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,890
these two again let's put a beehive over
here all right so they'll be able to

958
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:09,900
here all right so they'll be able to
 

959
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,710
here all right so they'll be able to
enter from here I'm gonna close this off

960
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
enter from here I'm gonna close this off
 

961
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,290
enter from here I'm gonna close this off
we'll breed a new baby bee so they'll

962
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,300
we'll breed a new baby bee so they'll
 

963
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,760
we'll breed a new baby bee so they'll
have a flower in here and they'll have a

964
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:19,770
have a flower in here and they'll have a
 

965
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,830
have a flower in here and they'll have a
hive axis let's see if that works it

966
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
hive axis let's see if that works it
 

967
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,690
hive axis let's see if that works it
they'll go in the hive and pollinate the

968
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:23,700
they'll go in the hive and pollinate the
 

969
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,200
they'll go in the hive and pollinate the
flower and stuff okay that worked so

970
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,210
flower and stuff okay that worked so
 

971
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,210
flower and stuff okay that worked so
that baby bee he went right to the

972
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,220
that baby bee he went right to the
 

973
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,780
that baby bee he went right to the
flower and then right to the hive so we

974
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:35,790
flower and then right to the hive so we
 

975
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,130
flower and then right to the hive so we
gotta be careful where we get our bees

976
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,140
gotta be careful where we get our bees
 

977
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,420
gotta be careful where we get our bees
from we can't take them from another

978
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,430
from we can't take them from another
 

979
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,970
from we can't take them from another
hive I think and then add them to our

980
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:40,980
hive I think and then add them to our
 

981
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
hive I think and then add them to our
system when we make it otherwise we'll

982
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:42,990
system when we make it otherwise we'll
 

983
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,390
system when we make it otherwise we'll
get a zombie be like this that does

984
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
get a zombie be like this that does
 

985
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,390
get a zombie be like this that does
nothing it was this fly there forever

986
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,400
nothing it was this fly there forever
 

987
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,190
nothing it was this fly there forever
I'm a little curious about something

988
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm a little curious about something
 

989
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm a little curious about something
let's try this do these guys triggered

990
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:51,510
let's try this do these guys triggered
 

991
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,740
let's try this do these guys triggered
pressure plates or do they float above

992
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:54,750
pressure plates or do they float above
 

993
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,750
pressure plates or do they float above
them looks like they float above them oh

994
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:58,760
them looks like they float above them oh
 

995
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,190
them looks like they float above them oh
he did hit he did hit it though and he

996
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
he did hit he did hit it though and he
 

997
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,430
he did hit he did hit it though and he
went down like that every now and then

998
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,440
went down like that every now and then
 

999
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,960
went down like that every now and then
he'll swoop down I wonder why okay look

1000
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:08,970
he'll swoop down I wonder why okay look
 

1001
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,400
he'll swoop down I wonder why okay look
at that only that guy's doing it not

1002
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,410
at that only that guy's doing it not
 

1003
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,000
at that only that guy's doing it not
that one

1004
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,010
that one
 

1005
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:18,470
that one
oh it triggered one bottle came out okay

1006
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
oh it triggered one bottle came out okay
 

1007
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,150
oh it triggered one bottle came out okay
that's good

1008
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,160
that's good
 

1009
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,340
that's good
that is very good so four out of five

1010
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,350
that is very good so four out of five
 

1011
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,830
that is very good so four out of five
will be glass bottles looks like another

1012
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
will be glass bottles looks like another
 

1013
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,660
will be glass bottles looks like another
bee went in there I think they can enter

1014
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:26,670
bee went in there I think they can enter
 

1015
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,280
bee went in there I think they can enter
from the side of the hives actually they

1016
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,290
from the side of the hives actually they
 

1017
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,440
from the side of the hives actually they
don't have to enter from the front so we

1018
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,450
don't have to enter from the front so we
 

1019
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,810
don't have to enter from the front so we
actually got a worker in there now he's

1020
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:32,820
actually got a worker in there now he's
 

1021
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,890
actually got a worker in there now he's
trying to figure it out

1022
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:33,900
trying to figure it out
 

1023
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,710
trying to figure it out
he can't I'm surprised that you can see

1024
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
he can't I'm surprised that you can see
 

1025
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,500
he can't I'm surprised that you can see
it like through the blocks that's

1026
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:39,510
it like through the blocks that's
 

1027
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,580
it like through the blocks that's
interesting all right well he might find

1028
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,590
interesting all right well he might find
 

1029
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,860
interesting all right well he might find
the hive - I'm not sure I don't think I

1030
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:45,870
the hive - I'm not sure I don't think I
 

1031
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,810
the hive - I'm not sure I don't think I
mentioned this but I believe the limits

1032
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:47,820
mentioned this but I believe the limits
 

1033
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,000
mentioned this but I believe the limits
be leave yet it

1034
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,010
be leave yet it
 

1035
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,430
be leave yet it
I believe the limit for the hives is

1036
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,440
I believe the limit for the hives is
 

1037
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,340
I believe the limit for the hives is
three bees maximum I think there's three

1038
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,350
three bees maximum I think there's three
 

1039
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,930
three bees maximum I think there's three
in there fourth one can't go inside yeah

1040
00:22:59,930 --> 00:22:59,940
in there fourth one can't go inside yeah
 

1041
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,249
in there fourth one can't go inside yeah
the plan is next episode

1042
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:02,259
the plan is next episode
 

1043
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,109
the plan is next episode
we're gonna make our big beef those lab

1044
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:04,119
we're gonna make our big beef those lab
 

1045
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,239
we're gonna make our big beef those lab
get all the honey and honeycomb in the

1046
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:06,249
get all the honey and honeycomb in the
 

1047
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,570
get all the honey and honeycomb in the
world but why do we want this stuff why

1048
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:09,580
world but why do we want this stuff why
 

1049
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,310
world but why do we want this stuff why
do we want it because we're kind of

1050
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,320
do we want it because we're kind of
 

1051
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,190
do we want it because we're kind of
running out of time this episode I guess

1052
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
running out of time this episode I guess
 

1053
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
running out of time this episode I guess
so these two things are pretty good with

1054
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,210
so these two things are pretty good with
 

1055
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,659
so these two things are pretty good with
the honeycombs we can make more beehives

1056
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:18,669
the honeycombs we can make more beehives
 

1057
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:21,629
the honeycombs we can make more beehives
but we can also make a decorative block

1058
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:21,639
but we can also make a decorative block
 

1059
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:22,080
but we can also make a decorative block
called

1060
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,090
called
 

1061
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,389
called
honeycomb that sounds pretty cool when

1062
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:27,399
honeycomb that sounds pretty cool when
 

1063
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,820
honeycomb that sounds pretty cool when
you walk on it actually so that's pretty

1064
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:29,830
you walk on it actually so that's pretty
 

1065
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,729
you walk on it actually so that's pretty
neat that's a nice block I could see

1066
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:32,739
neat that's a nice block I could see
 

1067
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,200
neat that's a nice block I could see
myself using that oh you don't use the

1068
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,210
myself using that oh you don't use the
 

1069
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,099
myself using that oh you don't use the
pick on it don't use that either okay

1070
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:38,109
pick on it don't use that either okay
 

1071
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:39,950
pick on it don't use that either okay
you don't use anything on it

1072
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:39,960
you don't use anything on it
 

1073
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,479
you don't use anything on it
yeah it's none of these four and it's it

1074
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:42,489
yeah it's none of these four and it's it
 

1075
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,009
yeah it's none of these four and it's it
doesn't look like as sheers either huh I

1076
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:46,019
doesn't look like as sheers either huh I
 

1077
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,749
doesn't look like as sheers either huh I
guess I guess it just takes a while to

1078
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:48,759
guess I guess it just takes a while to
 

1079
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,089
guess I guess it just takes a while to
harvest be careful if you're if you're

1080
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:51,099
harvest be careful if you're if you're
 

1081
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:54,899
harvest be careful if you're if you're
placing a lot of it down I guess yeah

1082
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:54,909
placing a lot of it down I guess yeah
 

1083
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,879
placing a lot of it down I guess yeah
there's a honeycomb box and then this is

1084
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:56,889
there's a honeycomb box and then this is
 

1085
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:00,589
there's a honeycomb box and then this is
the big one here the honey blocks oh

1086
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:00,599
the big one here the honey blocks oh
 

1087
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,839
the big one here the honey blocks oh
yeah look at these things they also

1088
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:06,849
yeah look at these things they also
 

1089
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,279
yeah look at these things they also
sound pretty cool so they're kind of

1090
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:08,289
sound pretty cool so they're kind of
 

1091
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,479
sound pretty cool so they're kind of
transparent they're very similar to

1092
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:09,489
transparent they're very similar to
 

1093
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:14,279
transparent they're very similar to
slime blocks they slow you down when you

1094
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:14,289
slime blocks they slow you down when you
 

1095
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,930
slime blocks they slow you down when you
walk on them I believe that feels slower

1096
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
walk on them I believe that feels slower
 

1097
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,180
walk on them I believe that feels slower
and you also can't really jump when

1098
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,190
and you also can't really jump when
 

1099
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,009
and you also can't really jump when
you're on them so that's a very unique

1100
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:23,019
you're on them so that's a very unique
 

1101
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,469
you're on them so that's a very unique
block I think that's pretty cool oh I

1102
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:25,479
block I think that's pretty cool oh I
 

1103
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,959
block I think that's pretty cool oh I
just got a cheap in sticky situation

1104
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:27,969
just got a cheap in sticky situation
 

1105
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,789
just got a cheap in sticky situation
jump into the honey block to break your

1106
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:29,799
jump into the honey block to break your
 

1107
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,149
jump into the honey block to break your
fall so I didn't know this they're

1108
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:33,159
fall so I didn't know this they're
 

1109
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,950
fall so I didn't know this they're
actually smaller than a full block you

1110
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
actually smaller than a full block you
 

1111
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,659
actually smaller than a full block you
can actually like I'm standing on the

1112
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:36,669
can actually like I'm standing on the
 

1113
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:40,259
can actually like I'm standing on the
piston here so you go in like 1/8 then

1114
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:40,269
piston here so you go in like 1/8 then
 

1115
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,579
piston here so you go in like 1/8 then
an eighth or a sixteenth of a block and

1116
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:44,589
an eighth or a sixteenth of a block and
 

1117
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,190
an eighth or a sixteenth of a block and
yeah if you if you like push yourself

1118
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
yeah if you if you like push yourself
 

1119
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,749
yeah if you if you like push yourself
against them as you're falling you do a

1120
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:48,759
against them as you're falling you do a
 

1121
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,570
against them as you're falling you do a
slow fall which is pretty cool pretty

1122
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:51,580
slow fall which is pretty cool pretty
 

1123
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,940
slow fall which is pretty cool pretty
cool also if you throw items at them

1124
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:53,950
cool also if you throw items at them
 

1125
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,709
cool also if you throw items at them
they kind of slow slow down the side

1126
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:57,719
they kind of slow slow down the side
 

1127
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:02,759
they kind of slow slow down the side
which is weird very weird this is gonna

1128
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:02,769
which is weird very weird this is gonna
 

1129
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,709
which is weird very weird this is gonna
have big applications in redstone as

1130
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:04,719
have big applications in redstone as
 

1131
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,869
have big applications in redstone as
well because they work much like slime

1132
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:06,879
well because they work much like slime
 

1133
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:10,049
well because they work much like slime
blocks in the in the sense that they

1134
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:10,059
blocks in the in the sense that they
 

1135
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,350
blocks in the in the sense that they
move blocks connected to them

1136
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,360
move blocks connected to them
 

1137
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,840
move blocks connected to them
all right but the big thing is they

1138
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:14,850
all right but the big thing is they
 

1139
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,240
all right but the big thing is they
don't actually move the slime blocks so

1140
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,250
don't actually move the slime blocks so
 

1141
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,930
don't actually move the slime blocks so
that means we can do stuff like this now

1142
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:19,940
that means we can do stuff like this now
 

1143
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,159
that means we can do stuff like this now
that wood couldn't before because

1144
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,169
that wood couldn't before because
 

1145
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,100
that wood couldn't before because
eventually you hit the limit on how made

1146
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,110
eventually you hit the limit on how made
 

1147
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,549
eventually you hit the limit on how made
you move uh-huh yes I'm pretty happy

1148
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
you move uh-huh yes I'm pretty happy
 

1149
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,049
you move uh-huh yes I'm pretty happy
about that as well probably try make

1150
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
about that as well probably try make
 

1151
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,730
about that as well probably try make
some redstone contraptions with the

1152
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:31,740
some redstone contraptions with the
 

1153
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,509
some redstone contraptions with the
honey block soon as well so maybe let's

1154
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:35,519
honey block soon as well so maybe let's
 

1155
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,370
honey block soon as well so maybe let's
do a couple other things here so this is

1156
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,380
do a couple other things here so this is
 

1157
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,779
do a couple other things here so this is
neat as well you make sugar from the

1158
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:38,789
neat as well you make sugar from the
 

1159
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,200
neat as well you make sugar from the
honey it's a good food source as well

1160
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,210
honey it's a good food source as well
 

1161
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,169
honey it's a good food source as well
it's look at this our food is full right

1162
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:45,179
it's look at this our food is full right
 

1163
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:45,560
it's look at this our food is full right
now

1164
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,570
now
 

1165
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,649
now
like all ten haunches but this is like

1166
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:48,659
like all ten haunches but this is like
 

1167
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,110
like all ten haunches but this is like
one of the few food items that you can

1168
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
one of the few food items that you can
 

1169
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,940
one of the few food items that you can
eat while you're full and it'll still

1170
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:55,950
eat while you're full and it'll still
 

1171
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,909
eat while you're full and it'll still
give you saturation you might need to

1172
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
give you saturation you might need to
 

1173
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,240
give you saturation you might need to
eat though to max it out so that's the

1174
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,250
eat though to max it out so that's the
 

1175
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,519
eat though to max it out so that's the
only problem I might be using that as my

1176
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:07,529
only problem I might be using that as my
 

1177
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,230
only problem I might be using that as my
main food source I haven't I haven't

1178
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,240
main food source I haven't I haven't
 

1179
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,539
main food source I haven't I haven't
figured it out yet I'll know once I try

1180
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:11,549
figured it out yet I'll know once I try
 

1181
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:14,480
figured it out yet I'll know once I try
it for a while but yeah that that gives

1182
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,490
it for a while but yeah that that gives
 

1183
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,159
it for a while but yeah that that gives
you saturation even after you're full

1184
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:16,169
you saturation even after you're full
 

1185
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,740
you saturation even after you're full
which is cool there's a few other things

1186
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:18,750
which is cool there's a few other things
 

1187
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,539
which is cool there's a few other things
that change like again we had a lot of

1188
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:20,549
that change like again we had a lot of
 

1189
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,720
that change like again we had a lot of
bug updates as this updates and a couple

1190
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:23,730
bug updates as this updates and a couple
 

1191
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,370
bug updates as this updates and a couple
new features like if we try to sleep

1192
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:25,380
new features like if we try to sleep
 

1193
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,860
new features like if we try to sleep
during the day we can now set our spawn

1194
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:27,870
during the day we can now set our spawn
 

1195
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,110
during the day we can now set our spawn
points even though it won't let us sleep

1196
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,120
points even though it won't let us sleep
 

1197
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,379
points even though it won't let us sleep
so that's neat I went over I used the

1198
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:33,389
so that's neat I went over I used the
 

1199
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,000
so that's neat I went over I used the
mushroom farm today and I noticed this

1200
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,010
mushroom farm today and I noticed this
 

1201
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,000
mushroom farm today and I noticed this
right away is like this is the level the

1202
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,010
right away is like this is the level the
 

1203
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,379
right away is like this is the level the
mushrooms are supposed to grow it and

1204
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:39,389
mushrooms are supposed to grow it and
 

1205
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,250
mushrooms are supposed to grow it and
some of them grew taller now which is

1206
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:43,260
some of them grew taller now which is
 

1207
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,320
some of them grew taller now which is
different so they I guess the check on

1208
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,330
different so they I guess the check on
 

1209
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,690
different so they I guess the check on
them changed which means I'll probably

1210
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:47,700
them changed which means I'll probably
 

1211
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,220
them changed which means I'll probably
just have to put a layer trapdoors at

1212
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,230
just have to put a layer trapdoors at
 

1213
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,740
just have to put a layer trapdoors at
the top here so that they always grow at

1214
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:51,750
the top here so that they always grow at
 

1215
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,330
the top here so that they always grow at
that height instead but that's worth

1216
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:53,340
that height instead but that's worth
 

1217
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,060
that height instead but that's worth
noting I think look in the inventory

1218
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,070
noting I think look in the inventory
 

1219
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,759
noting I think look in the inventory
here or our our GUI it looks like we got

1220
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:58,769
here or our our GUI it looks like we got
 

1221
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,799
here or our our GUI it looks like we got
highlights around the buttons now which

1222
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:00,809
highlights around the buttons now which
 

1223
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,200
highlights around the buttons now which
is a nice little feature and check this

1224
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,210
is a nice little feature and check this
 

1225
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,210
is a nice little feature and check this
out - this is pretty cool it's a simple

1226
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,220
out - this is pretty cool it's a simple
 

1227
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,370
out - this is pretty cool it's a simple
feature but it's nice iron golems now

1228
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:07,380
feature but it's nice iron golems now
 

1229
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,830
feature but it's nice iron golems now
show how much damage they have I think

1230
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
show how much damage they have I think
 

1231
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,480
show how much damage they have I think
there's like three different stages of

1232
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,490
there's like three different stages of
 

1233
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,850
there's like three different stages of
damage they display depending on how

1234
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:13,860
damage they display depending on how
 

1235
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,200
damage they display depending on how
many cracks they have so this guy's

1236
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,210
many cracks they have so this guy's
 

1237
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,659
many cracks they have so this guy's
looking pretty worn out right I think we

1238
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:17,669
looking pretty worn out right I think we
 

1239
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,269
looking pretty worn out right I think we
can heal them if we give them my iron

1240
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:20,279
can heal them if we give them my iron
 

1241
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,700
can heal them if we give them my iron
ingots that might have been

1242
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:24,710
ingots that might have been
 

1243
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,590
ingots that might have been
the second stage of damage this isn't

1244
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
the second stage of damage this isn't
 

1245
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,680
the second stage of damage this isn't
the guy that escaped from our tape by

1246
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:32,690
the guy that escaped from our tape by
 

1247
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,019
the guy that escaped from our tape by
the way he died this is a new one I just

1248
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:35,029
the way he died this is a new one I just
 

1249
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,230
the way he died this is a new one I just
put down you should on the Left home I'm

1250
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
put down you should on the Left home I'm
 

1251
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,730
put down you should on the Left home I'm
telling you the cruel world out there

1252
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:41,740
telling you the cruel world out there
 

1253
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,659
telling you the cruel world out there
can you take one more hit

1254
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:43,669
can you take one more hit
 

1255
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,580
can you take one more hit
can't tell oh yeah you hear that crack I

1256
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:48,590
can't tell oh yeah you hear that crack I
 

1257
