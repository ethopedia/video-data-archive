out a way to do the cookhouse and as
 

113
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,050
out a way to do the cookhouse and as
little space as possible so I got water

114
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,060
little space as possible so I got water
 

115
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,780
little space as possible so I got water
running up this pipe here they go over

116
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:56,790
running up this pipe here they go over
 

117
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,140
running up this pipe here they go over
then they fall and I'm going to be

118
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,150
then they fall and I'm going to be
 

119
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,539
then they fall and I'm going to be
testing I'm going to make them fall

120
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:02,549
testing I'm going to make them fall
 

121
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,520

123
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,770

and see how little space I can make it

124
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:10,780
and see how little space I can make it
 

125
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,250
and see how little space I can make it
work

126
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,260

here um so the goal with our cook house
is to damage the mobs to the point that

146
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:04,419
is to damage the mobs to the point that
 

147
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,950
is to damage the mobs to the point that
if they take one hit from sunlight or

148
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:07,960
if they take one hit from sunlight or
 

149
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,640
if they take one hit from sunlight or
one shot from a skeleton arrow they will

150
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:11,650
one shot from a skeleton arrow they will
 

151
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:19,710
one shot from a skeleton arrow they will
die so there's a no sunlight in this

152
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
die so there's a no sunlight in this
 

153
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,659
die so there's a no sunlight in this
area here I would just use gravity and

154
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:24,669
area here I would just use gravity and
 

155
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,600
area here I would just use gravity and
fall damage so you get them to the point

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,610
fall damage so you get them to the point
 

157
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,080
fall damage so you get them to the point
I want them but it would take a lot more

158
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,090
I want them but it would take a lot more
 

159
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,980
I want them but it would take a lot more
space so I thought I could just use a

160
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:33,990
space so I thought I could just use a
 

161
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,670
space so I thought I could just use a
lab a blade and drop them through it

162
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
lab a blade and drop them through it
 

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,090
lab a blade and drop them through it
they would take fire damage and then

164
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,100
they would take fire damage and then
 

165
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,860
they would take fire damage and then
they should be close to the point to die

166
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:43,870
they should be close to the point to die
 

167
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,680
they should be close to the point to die
but I guess the fire damage completely

168
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:46,690
but I guess the fire damage completely
 

169
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,680
but I guess the fire damage completely
kills them so that's not going to work

170
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,690
kills them so that's not going to work
 

171
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,740
kills them so that's not going to work
also sometimes they get too stuck in the

172
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:55,750
also sometimes they get too stuck in the
 

173
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,620
also sometimes they get too stuck in the
lab of the blade they try to swim up so

174
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:58,630
lab of the blade they try to swim up so
 

175
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,370
lab of the blade they try to swim up so
it's not reliable either but while I was

176
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:05,380
it's not reliable either but while I was
 

177
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,909
it's not reliable either but while I was
making this I got an even better idea so

178
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
making this I got an even better idea so
 

179
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,320
making this I got an even better idea so
that's what our second test is going to

that's what our second test is going to
 

181
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,640
that's what our second test is going to
be and I will show you that to you

182
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:14,650
be and I will show you that to you

00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:52,279
second idea this works very similar to
 

191
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,059
second idea this works very similar to
the way I did the spider killing thing

192
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:58,069

 

193
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,709

yeah I don't think it's very reliable is

210
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:07,870
yeah I don't think it's very reliable is
 

211
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,100
yeah I don't think it's very reliable is
the problem but sometimes it seems like

212
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,110
the problem but sometimes it seems like
 

213
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,180
the problem but sometimes it seems like
they take five it's sometimes six

they take five it's sometimes six

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,200

sometimes for this is just a little

sometimes for this is just a little

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,180
sometimes for this is just a little
stretch - I think I would need to make

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,190
stretch - I think I would need to make
 

219
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,650
stretch - I think I would need to make
it quite a bit longer like four times

220
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:25,660
it quite a bit longer like four times
 

221
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,980
it quite a bit longer like four times
longer at least to get them down to the

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:28,990
longer at least to get them down to the
 

223
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,699

225
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,509

so I'm probably just going to use

00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
so I'm probably just going to use
 

227
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,219
so I'm probably just going to use
gravity after all hey check out what

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:40,229
gravity after all hey check out what
 

229
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:50,809
gravity after all hey check out what
happens with spiders this is cool I'm

happens with spiders this is cool I'm

happens with spiders this is cool I'm
not evil I promise it's just funny

233
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:04,059

actually let's check this to make sure

234
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:04,069

 

235

not going to work although zombies can

not going to work although zombies can
actually attack the skeleton I don't

240
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:52,379
actually attack the skeleton I don't
 

241
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:57,789
actually attack the skeleton I don't
know it I thought they just chased them

00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,069

okay enough time wasting I'm going to

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,220
try gravity now okay so what I've done
 

247
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:15,549
try gravity now okay so what I've done
now is I've set up a tall pillar and

248
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:15,559
now is I've set up a tall pillar and
 

249
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,460
now is I've set up a tall pillar and
I've found out that pulling up 22 blocks

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,470
I've found out that pulling up 22 blocks
 

251
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,230
I've found out that pulling up 22 blocks
is about as high as you want using

252
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
is about as high as you want using
 

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,840
is about as high as you want using
myself as um whatchamacallit a dummy I

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,539
myself as um whatchamacallit a dummy I
found out that you don't want to go any

256
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:32,549
found out that you don't want to go any
 

257
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,840
found out that you don't want to go any
higher

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:35,850

 

259
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,110

this gets my hearts down to either half

260
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,120
this gets my hearts down to either half
 

261
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,680
this gets my hearts down to either half
a heart or one heart so gravity is a

262
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:43,690
a heart or one heart so gravity is a
 

263
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,220
a heart or one heart so gravity is a
little bit unreliable but it's pretty

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,230
little bit unreliable but it's pretty
 

265
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:56,579

good half a heart and switching to heart

266
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:56,589
good half a heart and switching to heart
 

267
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:04,769
good half a heart and switching to heart
or anything else makes no difference so

268
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:04,779
or anything else makes no difference so
 

269
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,950
or anything else makes no difference so
I think mobs are affected the same way I

270
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:07,960
I think mobs are affected the same way I
 

271
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,510
I think mobs are affected the same way I
think they have the same amount of

think they have the same amount of
 

273
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,000
think they have the same amount of
health so making them fall 22 blocks

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,010
health so making them fall 22 blocks
 

275
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:22,829
health so making them fall 22 blocks
should work pretty good I think okay

276
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
should work pretty good I think okay
 

277
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,769
