00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,150
obviously i want to use the simplest and
most effective but i don't know what

678
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
most effective but i don't know what
 

679
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,080
most effective but i don't know what
that is

680
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,090
that is
 

681
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,389
that is
[Music]

682
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
[Music]
 

683
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,470
[Music]
uh what i have added since last time is

684
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
uh what i have added since last time is
 

685
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,710
uh what i have added since last time is
the memory

686
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
the memory
 

687
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,350
the memory
array so this thing will hold

688
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
array so this thing will hold
 

689
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,910
array so this thing will hold
what questions or what answers are

690
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
what questions or what answers are
 

691
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,790
what questions or what answers are
correct so

692
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
correct so
 

693
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,590
correct so
three of these blocks will be glass and

694
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
three of these blocks will be glass and
 

695
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,069
three of these blocks will be glass and
one will be a solid one

696
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
one will be a solid one
 

697
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,110
one will be a solid one
which will represent the a b c d

698
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
which will represent the a b c d
 

699
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,629
which will represent the a b c d
the solid block will be the correct

700
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
the solid block will be the correct
 

701
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,430
the solid block will be the correct
answer one and if it's correct the power

702
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
answer one and if it's correct the power
 

703
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,389
answer one and if it's correct the power
can transfer

704
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
can transfer
 

705
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,790
can transfer
through the solid block to this wire on

706
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
through the solid block to this wire on
 

707
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,710
through the solid block to this wire on
the other side

708
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
the other side
 

709
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,990
the other side
and that is the wind detection

710
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
and that is the wind detection
 

711
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,310
and that is the wind detection
correct answer detection

712
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320

 

713
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,590

but when i was building this i was

714
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
but when i was building this i was
 

715
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,670
but when i was building this i was
having a lot of trouble getting

716
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680

 

717
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,949

these blocks to cycle properly i did do

718
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
these blocks to cycle properly i did do
 

719
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,350
these blocks to cycle properly i did do
the

720
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
the
 

721
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,910
the
five by three instead of the five by

722
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
five by three instead of the five by
 

723
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,749
five by three instead of the five by
four like i was going to

724
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
four like i was going to
 

725
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,069
four like i was going to

his video was very helpful i actually

730
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
his video was very helpful i actually
 

731
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,110
his video was very helpful i actually
watched it again

732
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
watched it again
 

733
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,550
watched it again
because i'm in trouble and it seems i

734
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
because i'm in trouble and it seems i
 

735
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,509
because i'm in trouble and it seems i
was just

736
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
was just
 

737
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,670
was just
activating the blocks in the wrong order

738
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
activating the blocks in the wrong order
 

739
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,910
activating the blocks in the wrong order
so thank you for your help buddy

740
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920

 

741
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,949

and let's see i have

742
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959

 

743
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,030

yeah so if i send a pulse to this wire

744
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
yeah so if i send a pulse to this wire
 

745
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,949
yeah so if i send a pulse to this wire
here it causes three things to happen

746
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
here it causes three things to happen
 

747
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,269
here it causes three things to happen
now

748
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
now
 

749
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,389
now
this wire here one it will send

750
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
this wire here one it will send
 

751
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,509
this wire here one it will send
power to

752
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519

 

753
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,110

this cycle here which causes the

754
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
this cycle here which causes the
 

755
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,509
this cycle here which causes the
glowstone to go around a loop

756
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
glowstone to go around a loop
 

757
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,949
glowstone to go around a loop
and that just indicates what question we

758
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
and that just indicates what question we
 

759
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,429
and that just indicates what question we
are on

760
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
are on
 

761
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,590
are on
that's the only purpose so right now

762
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
that's the only purpose so right now
 

763
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,949
that's the only purpose so right now
it's showing we're on question number 10

764
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959

 

765
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,710

and it also that wire also cycles this

766
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
and it also that wire also cycles this
 

767
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,270
and it also that wire also cycles this
thing which again keeps track of what

768
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
thing which again keeps track of what
 

769
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,429
thing which again keeps track of what
question we are on but for the sake of

770
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
question we are on but for the sake of
 

771
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,669
question we are on but for the sake of
the scoreboard memory

772
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679

 

773
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,590

okay so let's see how does this work

774
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
okay so let's see how does this work
 

775
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,310
okay so let's see how does this work
again i think if i just hit this button

776
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
again i think if i just hit this button
 

777
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,350
again i think if i just hit this button
yeah so since we're on question 10

778
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
yeah so since we're on question 10
 

779
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,590
yeah so since we're on question 10
if we get the right answer we send power

780
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
if we get the right answer we send power
 

781
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,029
if we get the right answer we send power
to that and then

782
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
to that and then
 

783
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,830
to that and then
the light comes on for the one directly

784
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
the light comes on for the one directly
 

785
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,430
the light comes on for the one directly
below

786
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
below
 

787
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,990
below
and then the third thing this wire is

788
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
and then the third thing this wire is
 

789
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,870
and then the third thing this wire is
connected to

790
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
connected to
 

791
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,750
connected to
is the memory unit

792
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
is the memory unit
 

793
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,710
is the memory unit
so it cycles to through the questions so

794
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
so it cycles to through the questions so
 

795
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,630
so it cycles to through the questions so
that the answers keep changing like we

796
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
that the answers keep changing like we
 

797
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,230
that the answers keep changing like we
need them to

798
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
need them to
 

799
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,230
need them to
so you can see the sandstone is at the

800
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
so you can see the sandstone is at the
 

801
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,270
so you can see the sandstone is at the
top too here if we hit the button

802
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
top too here if we hit the button
 

803
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,710
top too here if we hit the button
it'll cycle around if i can figure out

804
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
it'll cycle around if i can figure out
 

805
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,350
it'll cycle around if i can figure out
how to get out of here

806
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
how to get out of here
 

807
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,630
how to get out of here
that's the thing i don't really like

808
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
that's the thing i don't really like
 

809
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,270
that's the thing i don't really like
about doing one hour thing one-hour

810
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
about doing one hour thing one-hour
 

811
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,150
about doing one hour thing one-hour
videos i kind of get half-assed at doing

812
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
videos i kind of get half-assed at doing
 

813
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,150
videos i kind of get half-assed at doing
stuff i hope you don't mind

814
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
stuff i hope you don't mind
 

815
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,070
stuff i hope you don't mind
today i'm a little bit more natural i

816
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
today i'm a little bit more natural i
 

817
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,669
today i'm a little bit more natural i
guess

818
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
guess
 

819
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,590
guess
not so worried about making mistakes in

820
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
not so worried about making mistakes in
 

821
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,830
not so worried about making mistakes in
this video

822
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
this video
 

823
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,110
this video
or for saying stupid things i guess okay

824
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
or for saying stupid things i guess okay
 

825
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,990
or for saying stupid things i guess okay
let's hit the button

826
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000

 

827
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,350

you see those things cycled

828
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
you see those things cycled
 

829
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,710
you see those things cycled
oh can't go down that way

830
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720

 

831
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,870

just a mess working with this redstone

832
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880

 

833
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,830

uh yeah okay over here so you see they

834
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
uh yeah okay over here so you see they
 

835
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,549
uh yeah okay over here so you see they
moved

836
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
moved
 

837
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,669
moved
they're going down right up left down

838
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
they're going down right up left down
 

839
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,070
they're going down right up left down
right

840
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
right
 

841
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,750
right
up left and these pistons

842
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
up left and these pistons
 

843
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,430
up left and these pistons
all have a wire running across to

844
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
all have a wire running across to
 

845
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,549
all have a wire running across to
activate them

846
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559

 

847
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,150

can't move

848
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

 

849
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,510

the wire comes down from there goes here

850
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
the wire comes down from there goes here
 

851
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,430
the wire comes down from there goes here
first one it goes to is this set of

852
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
first one it goes to is this set of
 

853
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,350
first one it goes to is this set of
pistons then it goes

854
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
pistons then it goes
 

855
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,870
pistons then it goes
over here one torch delay to

856
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880

 

857
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,150

this lower set

858
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160

 

859
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,750

continues going this way another one

860
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
continues going this way another one
 

861
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,230
continues going this way another one
torch delay to

862
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
torch delay to
 

863
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,789
torch delay to
the lower right set there and then

864
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
the lower right set there and then
 

865
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,150
the lower right set there and then
another one torch delay

866
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
another one torch delay
 

867
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,909
another one torch delay
to this upper right set here and that's

868
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
to this upper right set here and that's
 

869
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,590
to this upper right set here and that's
that's the order they're they're firing

870
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
that's the order they're they're firing
 

871
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,789
that's the order they're they're firing
at the pistons

872
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799

 

873
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,549

right cool

874
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
right cool
 

875
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,669
right cool
all right awesome and that's all i've

876
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
all right awesome and that's all i've
 

877
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,029
all right awesome and that's all i've
done on the trivia game not much

878
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
done on the trivia game not much
 

879
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,870
done on the trivia game not much
i don't know if i had this all done here

880
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
i don't know if i had this all done here
 

881
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,230
i don't know if i had this all done here
this is this is the final

882
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
this is this is the final
 

883
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,710
this is this is the final
way i'm doing the the panel i'm pretty

884
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
way i'm doing the the panel i'm pretty
 

885
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,070
way i'm doing the the panel i'm pretty
sure i think it looks good

886
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080

 

887
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,549

cool

888
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559

 

889
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,070

so i did not fully figure out how i'm

890
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
so i did not fully figure out how i'm
 

891
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,470
so i did not fully figure out how i'm
doing the cheat prevention somebody sent

892
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
doing the cheat prevention somebody sent
 

893
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,070
doing the cheat prevention somebody sent
me a video a while ago i'll have to look

894
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
me a video a while ago i'll have to look
 

895
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,710
me a video a while ago i'll have to look
for it again where they were

896
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
for it again where they were
 

897
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,390
for it again where they were
they somehow had i don't remember

898
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
they somehow had i don't remember
 

899
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,990
they somehow had i don't remember
exactly how it worked because it was so

900
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
exactly how it worked because it was so
 

901
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,270
exactly how it worked because it was so
long ago i saw it but

902
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
long ago i saw it but
 

903
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,350
long ago i saw it but
he somehow a repeater and a sand block

904
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
he somehow a repeater and a sand block
 

905
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,830
he somehow a repeater and a sand block
with a

906
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
with a
 

907
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:45,029
with a
piston underneath

908
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039

 

909
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,070

i'm not sure

910
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080

 

911
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,950

yeah i don't know somehow he had it so

912
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
yeah i don't know somehow he had it so
 

913
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,669
yeah i don't know somehow he had it so
if the person kept hammering the buttons

914
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
if the person kept hammering the buttons
 

915
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,590
if the person kept hammering the buttons
the sand would stay up and the power

916
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
the sand would stay up and the power
 

917
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,750
the sand would stay up and the power
wouldn't transfer through i think he was

918
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
wouldn't transfer through i think he was
 

919
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,630
wouldn't transfer through i think he was
using a delay

920
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
using a delay
 

921
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,020
using a delay
probably

922
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,030

i know that wasn't very informative so i

926
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
i know that wasn't very informative so i
 

927
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,750
i know that wasn't very informative so i
was playing around with something

928
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
was playing around with something
 

929
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,549
was playing around with something
similar to what he did

930
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
similar to what he did
 

931
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,830
similar to what he did
and i figured out an interesting

932
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
and i figured out an interesting
 

933
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,990
and i figured out an interesting
monostable

934
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
monostable
 

935
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,549
monostable
circuit i believe they're called or

936
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
circuit i believe they're called or
 

937
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,230
circuit i believe they're called or
pulse limiter i don't know

938
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
pulse limiter i don't know
 

939
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,750
pulse limiter i don't know
something that converts a long pulse

940
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
something that converts a long pulse
 

941
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,230
something that converts a long pulse
into a short pulse

942
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
into a short pulse
 

943
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,230
into a short pulse
which i found a little interesting so i

944
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
which i found a little interesting so i
 

945
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,029
which i found a little interesting so i
have repeater

946
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
have repeater
 

947
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,830
have repeater
with a sticky piston below the sandstone

948
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
with a sticky piston below the sandstone
 

949
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,390
with a sticky piston below the sandstone
block

950
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
block
 

951
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,990
block
and on the other side is another

952
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
and on the other side is another
 

953
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,830
and on the other side is another
repeater

954
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
repeater
 

955
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,789
repeater
so if you send a button press which is

956
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
so if you send a button press which is
 

957
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,950
so if you send a button press which is
usually a one second

958
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
usually a one second
 

959
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,870
usually a one second
power time

960
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
power time
 

961
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,549
power time
you can see this wire here is lighting

962
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
you can see this wire here is lighting
 

963
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,270
you can see this wire here is lighting
up

964
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280

 

965
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,950

so if you had tnt next to it or

966
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
so if you had tnt next to it or
 

967
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,909
so if you had tnt next to it or
something it would probably get

968
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
something it would probably get
 

969
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,590
something it would probably get
activated

970
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600

 

971
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,549

but you can see it's not enough time for

972
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
but you can see it's not enough time for
 

973
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,630
but you can see it's not enough time for
this torch to switch states

974
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
this torch to switch states
 

975
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,909
this torch to switch states
the pulse is too quick

976
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
the pulse is too quick
 

977
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,789
the pulse is too quick
and so this piston doesn't move if we

978
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
and so this piston doesn't move if we
 

979
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,430
and so this piston doesn't move if we
lengthen

980
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
lengthen
 

981
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,870
lengthen
the pulse time another torch delay

982
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
the pulse time another torch delay
 

983
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,029
the pulse time another torch delay
then you can see it's enough time for

984
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
then you can see it's enough time for
 

985
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,990
then you can see it's enough time for
the torch to switch states

986
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000

 

987
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,590

which is cool um

988
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
which is cool um
 

989
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,270
which is cool um
and you can lengthen it even more if you

990
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
and you can lengthen it even more if you
 

991
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,390
and you can lengthen it even more if you
want

992
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400

 

993
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,070

oh i don't know i thought that was kind

994
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
oh i don't know i thought that was kind
 

995
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,270
oh i don't know i thought that was kind
of interesting

996
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280

 

997
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,870

i was trying to use it for cheat

998
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
i was trying to use it for cheat
 

999
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,310
i was trying to use it for cheat
prevention so if the person

1000
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
prevention so if the person
 

1001
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,430
prevention so if the person
keeps hammering a button

1002
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440

 

1003
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,029

you can see the sticky piston above

1004
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
you can see the sticky piston above
 

1005
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,029
you can see the sticky piston above
there only activated once even though

1006
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
there only activated once even though
 

1007
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,310
there only activated once even though
i've been

1008
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
i've been
 

1009
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:54,070
i've been
pressing this button lots of times

1010
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
pressing this button lots of times
 

1011
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,430
pressing this button lots of times
let's see it stays

1012
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440

 

1013
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,870

i don't know something i was playing

1014
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
i don't know something i was playing
 

1015
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,470
i don't know something i was playing
with i don't know if it's useful

1016
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
with i don't know if it's useful
 

1017
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,990
with i don't know if it's useful
for anything actually

1018
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000

 

1019
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,549

actually since i'm trying to kill time a

1020
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
actually since i'm trying to kill time a
 

1021
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,350

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,669

yeah all that leaf stuff was done before

1360
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
yeah all that leaf stuff was done before
 

1361
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,630
yeah all that leaf stuff was done before
you were able to

1362
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
you were able to
 

1363
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,070
you were able to
collect leaves with shears oh okay

1364
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
collect leaves with shears oh okay
 

1365
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,710
collect leaves with shears oh okay
these boats are still in place i don't

1366
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
these boats are still in place i don't
 

1367

know
 

1369
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,029
know
it seems weird there's a lot of boats

1370
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
it seems weird there's a lot of boats
 

1371
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,430
it seems weird there's a lot of boats
there actually

1372
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
there actually
 

1373
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,789
there actually
there's like 10 votes there

1374
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799

 

1375
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:57,830

maybe they're getting released

1376
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840

 

1377
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,269

hmm oh i should have saved one

1378
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:01,279
hmm oh i should have saved one
 

1379
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,190
hmm oh i should have saved one
oh well this thing is

1380
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
oh well this thing is
 

1381
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,710
oh well this thing is
a boat elevator to the surface

1382
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
a boat elevator to the surface
 

1383
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,950
a boat elevator to the surface
people said i should call it the etho

1384
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
people said i should call it the etho
 

1385
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,430
people said i should call it the etho
vader i never did release a tutorial for

1386
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
vader i never did release a tutorial for
 

1387
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,350
vader i never did release a tutorial for
it because

1388
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
it because
 

1389
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,230
it because
it also has a serious flaw

1390
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240

 

1391
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,830

maybe i'll load a boat into it to show

1392
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:26,840

 

1393
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,990

you

1394
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
you
 

1395
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,909
you
all right that's how you load it boot

1396
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
all right that's how you load it boot
 

1397
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,029
all right that's how you load it boot
comes up here

1398
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
comes up here
 

1399
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,149
comes up here
goes to the left you hop in and the

1400
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
goes to the left you hop in and the
 

1401
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:34,789
goes to the left you hop in and the
pressure plate

1402
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
pressure plate
 

1403
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,149
pressure plate
gets activated and you float to the

1404
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
gets activated and you float to the
 

1405
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,430
gets activated and you float to the
surface

1406
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440

 

1407
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,630

there's probably going to be a boat up

1408
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640
there's probably going to be a boat up
 

1409
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,549
there's probably going to be a boat up
here

1410
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
here
 

1411
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,950
here
yep

1412
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960

 

1413
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,549

and then if you step on this pressure

1414
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
and then if you step on this pressure
 

1415
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,230
and then if you step on this pressure
plate it drops down

1416
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
plate it drops down
 

1417
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,470
plate it drops down
and you are free to jump down as well

1418
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
and you are free to jump down as well
 

1419
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,230
and you are free to jump down as well
safely

1420
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240

 

1421
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,190

yeah this is a problem with this see the

1422
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
yeah this is a problem with this see the
 

1423
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,110
yeah this is a problem with this see the
boats there it's being held in place by

1424
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
boats there it's being held in place by
 

1425
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,470
boats there it's being held in place by
the trap door

1426
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
the trap door
 

1427
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,830
the trap door
by exit and then

1428
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
by exit and then
 

1429
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,990
by exit and then
enter there goes

1430
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
enter there goes
 

1431
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,590
enter there goes
so that's why i never released a

1432
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
so that's why i never released a
 

1433
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,350
so that's why i never released a
tutorial for this you're better to use

1434
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
tutorial for this you're better to use
 

1435
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,870
tutorial for this you're better to use
pistons

1436
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
pistons
 

1437
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,549
pistons
to hold the boat down instead of

1438
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
to hold the boat down instead of
 

1439
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,190
to hold the boat down instead of
trapdoors

1440
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200

 

1441
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,909

and here is further plan for the eats

1442
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
and here is further plan for the eats
 

1443
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,710
and here is further plan for the eats
road which

1444
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
road which
 

1445
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,830
road which
goes

1446
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,840

 

1447
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,909

down

1448
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919

 

1449
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,950

but i haven't done much with that

1450
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960

 

1451
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,350

okay

1452
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360

 

1453
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,789

what else what else maybe we'll go up

1454
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799

 

1455
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,110

1457
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,110

is another mob system this was done for

1458
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
is another mob system this was done for
 

1459
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,310
is another mob system this was done for
a tutorial the original mob system

1460
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
a tutorial the original mob system
 

1461
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,550

flowers in that flowers and seeds
 

1499
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,750
flowers in that flowers and seeds
this was before people showed me

1500
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
this was before people showed me
 

1501
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,270
this was before people showed me
the dark room exploit the smurf

1502
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
the dark room exploit the smurf
 

1503
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,310
the dark room exploit the smurf
as static calls it

1504
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
as static calls it
 

1505
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,230
as static calls it
so basically i showed the tutorial for

1506
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
so basically i showed the tutorial for
 

1507
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,910
so basically i showed the tutorial for
this and then

1508
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
this and then
 

1509
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,990
this and then
smurf caught on as the popular one

1510
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000

 

1511
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,430

know more about it basically it's used
for

1520
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
for
 

1521
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,230
for
harvesting flowers and seeds from tall

1522
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
harvesting flowers and seeds from tall
 

1523
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,910
harvesting flowers and seeds from tall
grass

1524
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
grass
 

1525
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,750
grass
using bone meal

1526
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760

 

1527
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,950

and you place water here and any tall

1531
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,390
grass
on the grass gets harvested above and

1532
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
on the grass gets harvested above and
 

1533
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,310
on the grass gets harvested above and
below

1535
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,829

but shortly after i released the

1536
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
but shortly after i released the
 

1537
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,190
but shortly after i released the
tutorial for this people figured out the

1538
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,200
tutorial for this people figured out the

1541
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:46,790

so this became obsolete basically

1542
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800

 

1543
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,829

okay back to the storage room here this

00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
okay back to the storage room here this
 

1545
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,109

hit the dispenser you get an axe and

1612
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
hit the dispenser you get an axe and
 

1613
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,430
hit the dispenser you get an axe and
then you

1614
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440

 

1615
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,349

go all around this loop

1616
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359

 

1617
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,270

harvest all the wood then get stuff

1618
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
harvest all the wood then get stuff
 

1619
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,109
harvest all the wood then get stuff
above you

1620
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,119
above you

leaves will die the saplings fall in the

1622
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
leaves will die the saplings fall in the
 

1623
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,790
leaves will die the saplings fall in the
water below

1624
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
water below
 

1625
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,550
water below
and then they end up

1626
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:14,560
and then they end up
 

1627
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,310
and then they end up
over here and then you can put them in a

1628
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
over here and then you can put them in a
 

1629
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,870
over here and then you can put them in a
chest

1630
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:18,880

 

1631
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,349

it's also a water staircase

1632
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359

 

1633
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,829

so we have a chest for fertilizer which

1634
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
so we have a chest for fertilizer which
 

1635
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,710
so we have a chest for fertilizer which
is empty

1636
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
is empty
 

1637
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,230
is empty

00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599

 

2055
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,829

also near the trivia game are these

2056
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
also near the trivia game are these
 

2057
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,910
also near the trivia game are these
other canons here i made one for each

2058
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
other canons here i made one for each
 

2059
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,390
other canons here i made one for each
donor at the time

2060
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
donor at the time
 

2061
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,230
donor at the time
and uh when you launched them they made

2062
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:16,240
and uh when you launched them they made
 

2063
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,910
and uh when you launched them they made
like a little firework show it's pretty

2064
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
like a little firework show it's pretty
 

2065
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,190
like a little firework show it's pretty
cool

2066
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
cool
 

2067
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,549
cool
but the 1.6 patch killed them all so

2068
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
but the 1.6 patch killed them all so
 

2069
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,870
but the 1.6 patch killed them all so
they don't work anymore unfortunately

2070
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880

 

2071
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,910

and finally our world tour takes us to

2072
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
and finally our world tour takes us to
 

2073
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,670
and finally our world tour takes us to
the ice base

2074
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
the ice base
 

2075
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,510
the ice base
this is where a lot of the future

2076
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
this is where a lot of the future
 

2077
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,069
this is where a lot of the future
projects are going to be

2078
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
projects are going to be
 

2079
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,589
projects are going to be
i got lots of plans for here

2080
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:43,599

 

2081
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,390

we have emp units this is definitely the

2082
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
we have emp units this is definitely the
 

2083
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,390
we have emp units this is definitely the
most complicated part of my world

2084
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
most complicated part of my world
 

2085
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,430
most complicated part of my world
there's so much wiring and pistons and

2086
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
there's so much wiring and pistons and
 

2087
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,870
there's so much wiring and pistons and
stuff like that

2088
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880
stuff like that
 

2089
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,950
stuff like that
in such a small area

2090
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:56,960

 

2091
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,549

but it's getting to the point now where

2092
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
but it's getting to the point now where
 

2093
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,710
but it's getting to the point now where
i can work on finishing up

2094
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
i can work on finishing up
 

2095
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,829
i can work on finishing up
and actually building onto this

2096
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:02,839
and actually building onto this
 

2097
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,230
and actually building onto this
structure

2098
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
structure
 

2099
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,470
structure
which i'm looking forward to i'm i

2100
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
which i'm looking forward to i'm i
 

2101
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,589
which i'm looking forward to i'm i
really want to start

2102
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
really want to start
 

2103
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,710
really want to start
building farms and stuff and

2104
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
building farms and stuff and
 

2105
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,589
building farms and stuff and
stuff that looks nice instead of working

2106
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:13,599
stuff that looks nice instead of working
 

2107
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,790
stuff that looks nice instead of working
on mob stuff all the time

2108
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
on mob stuff all the time
 

2109
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,109
on mob stuff all the time
not that mob stuff isn't fun

2110
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119

 

2111
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,910

and yeah you can see i've actually added

2112
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
and yeah you can see i've actually added
 

2113
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,750
and yeah you can see i've actually added
a second tower now

2114
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760

 

2115
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,670

still hasn't been made pretty yet though

2116
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680

 

2117
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,349

these towers are for the hostile mob

2118
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:33,359
these towers are for the hostile mob
 

2119
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,270
these towers are for the hostile mob
system the ones i'm climbing right now

2120
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
system the ones i'm climbing right now
 

2121
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,270
system the ones i'm climbing right now
but then we also have the passive mob

2122
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
but then we also have the passive mob
 

2123
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,030
but then we also have the passive mob
system over here

2124
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,040

 

2125
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,670

which needs to be adjusted yet

2126
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:47,680
which needs to be adjusted yet
 

2127
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,080
which needs to be adjusted yet
but currently functions

2128
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,090

 

2129
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,309

pretty cool pretty cool

2132
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:00,400
pretty cool pretty cool
 

2133
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,470
pretty cool pretty cool
so much work has gone into this little

2134
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
so much work has gone into this little
 

2135
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,510
so much work has gone into this little
area already

2136
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:07,520

 

2137
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,069

one thing we need to do soon is the item

2138
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
one thing we need to do soon is the item
 

2139
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:10,950
one thing we need to do soon is the item
collection

2140
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:10,960
collection
 

2141
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,710
collection
system here needs to be finished

2142
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720

 

2143
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,630

and we need to do the tubing for the

2144
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
and we need to do the tubing for the
 

2145
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,309
and we need to do the tubing for the
hostile stuff but i might do that off

2146
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
hostile stuff but i might do that off
 

2147
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,430
hostile stuff but i might do that off
camera

2148
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:23,440
camera
 

2149
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,230
camera
since we've seen it a million times but

2150
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
since we've seen it a million times but
 

2151
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,990
since we've seen it a million times but
yeah let's check it out

2152
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
yeah let's check it out
 

2153
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,270
yeah let's check it out
here we go i

2154
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
here we go i
 

2155
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:39,750
here we go i
am quite happy with it

2156
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760

 

2157
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:47,990

hopefully it gets going here

2158
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000

 

2159
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,349

actually i should check to make sure i

2160
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359
actually i should check to make sure i
 

2161
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,910
actually i should check to make sure i
don't have any lights on in it

2162
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:51,920
don't have any lights on in it
 

2163
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,270
don't have any lights on in it
now they're probably off

2164
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280

 

2165
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,190

i think i have spiders off at the moment

2166
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
i think i have spiders off at the moment
 

2167
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,630
i think i have spiders off at the moment
though so it's a little bit slower

2168
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640

 

2169
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,910

but yeah it works really well

2170
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
but yeah it works really well
 

2171
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,309
but yeah it works really well
with two towers i can make a stack of

2172
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:08,319
with two towers i can make a stack of
 

2173
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,109
with two towers i can make a stack of
tnt

2174
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
tnt
 

2175
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:16,549
tnt
in every every 10 or 15 minutes now

2176
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:16,559

 

2177
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,950

like i just get so many drops

2178
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960

 

2179
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:32,390

yeah i got some tnt here

2180
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400

 

2181
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,670

it's so cool so i will need to adjust it

2182
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,680
it's so cool so i will need to adjust it
 

2183
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,270
it's so cool so i will need to adjust it
though when endermen come out

2184
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
though when endermen come out
 

2185
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,870
though when endermen come out
because apparently they can move

2186
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
because apparently they can move
 

2187
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,549
because apparently they can move
cobblestone

2188
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
cobblestone
 

2189
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,069
cobblestone
we'll have to figure out what to do with

2190
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:42,079
we'll have to figure out what to do with
 

2191
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,430
we'll have to figure out what to do with
that

2192
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,440

 

2193
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:54,630

but overall it's working very well

2194
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,640

 

2195
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,710

yeah so after about five minutes this is

2196
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
yeah so after about five minutes this is
 

2197
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,109
yeah so after about five minutes this is
how many items are on the ground

2198
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
how many items are on the ground
 

2199
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,910
how many items are on the ground
it's actually enough to lag my game

2200
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920

 

2201
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:13,740

quite a bit while recording

2202
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:13,750

 

2203
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:20,630

[Applause]

2204
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640

 

2205
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:36,710

that's one sided

2206
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720

 

2207
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,190

well that's the other side what do we

2208
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
well that's the other side what do we
 

2209
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,230
well that's the other side what do we
get

2210
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,240

 

2211
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,150

just about two stacks of gunpowder every

2212
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
just about two stacks of gunpowder every
 

2213
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,549
just about two stacks of gunpowder every
five minutes two stacks

2214
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
five minutes two stacks
 

2215
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,430
five minutes two stacks
two and a half stacks of feathers one

2216
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:51,440

 

2217
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,349

got a stack of oh two stacks of arrows

2218
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:55,359
got a stack of oh two stacks of arrows
 

2219
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,990
got a stack of oh two stacks of arrows
and about two stacks of bones that's

2220
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
and about two stacks of bones that's
 

2221
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,789
and about two stacks of bones that's
like every five minutes at this rate

2222
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
like every five minutes at this rate
 

2223
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,710
like every five minutes at this rate
but we have not reached max potential

2224
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
but we have not reached max potential
 

2225
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,549
but we have not reached max potential
yet it can still be sped up
