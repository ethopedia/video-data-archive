later guys i've been working on
the pumpkin farm we started last episode

116
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
the pumpkin farm we started last episode
 

117
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,430
the pumpkin farm we started last episode
and

118
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
and
 

119
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,750
and
during the time i've been doing this no

120
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
during the time i've been doing this no
 

121
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,910
during the time i've been doing this no
lag so i think those guys were

122
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
lag so i think those guys were
 

123
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,190
lag so i think those guys were
definitely the cause i first noticed the

124
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
definitely the cause i first noticed the
 

125
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,790
definitely the cause i first noticed the
problem when i upgraded to

126
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
problem when i upgraded to
 

127
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,790
problem when i upgraded to
like the newest version of minecraft and

128
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
like the newest version of minecraft and
 

129
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,949
like the newest version of minecraft and
i thought it was the culprit

130
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
i thought it was the culprit
 

131
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,030
i thought it was the culprit
so i downgraded but even after i

132
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
so i downgraded but even after i
 

133
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,309
so i downgraded but even after i
downgraded i still had

134
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
downgraded i still had
 

135
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,110
downgraded i still had
lag and i thought maybe it had something

136
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
lag and i thought maybe it had something
 

137
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,270
lag and i thought maybe it had something
to do with the new sounds

138
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
to do with the new sounds
 

139
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,630
to do with the new sounds
that they introduced in the game because

140
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
that they introduced in the game because
 

141
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,149
that they introduced in the game because
there's so many new sound files i

142
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
there's so many new sound files i
 

143
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,789
there's so many new sound files i
thought

144
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
thought
 

145
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,470
thought
maybe that messed it up um

146
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
maybe that messed it up um
 

147
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,190
maybe that messed it up um

but it was it was those iron golems just
 

149
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,630

like that
and just watching it here every time the

232
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
and just watching it here every time the

growing and getting harvested seems to
 

237
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,870
growing and getting harvested seems to
be pretty good

238
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880

 

239
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,749

i say that and then nothing grows it's

240
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
i say that and then nothing grows it's
 

241
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,390
i say that and then nothing grows it's
like one every

242
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
like one every
 

243
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,909
like one every
i don't know three or four seconds maybe

244
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
i don't know three or four seconds maybe
 

245
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,710
i don't know three or four seconds maybe
seems to be about the right uh i did not

246
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
seems to be about the right uh i did not
 

247
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,189
seems to be about the right uh i did not
put in a nighttime operation mode yet i

248
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
put in a nighttime operation mode yet i
 

249
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,790
put in a nighttime operation mode yet i
might do that

250
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
might do that
 

251
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,469
might do that
but even as it is right now i think it's

252
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
but even as it is right now i think it's
 

253
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,629
but even as it is right now i think it's
pretty good

254
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
pretty good
 

255
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,430
pretty good
all right uh there is the odd pumpkin

256
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
all right uh there is the odd pumpkin
 

257
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,590
all right uh there is the odd pumpkin
landing on the dirt here

258
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
landing on the dirt here
 

259
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,749
landing on the dirt here
i put in these like last things above

260
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
i put in these like last things above
 

261
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,510
i put in these like last things above
these dead zones

262
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
these dead zones
 

263
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,790
these dead zones
um because if any pumpkins land in those

264
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
um because if any pumpkins land in those
 

265
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,510
um because if any pumpkins land in those
dead zones

266
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
dead zones
 

267
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,870
dead zones
then if another one comes by it

268
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
then if another one comes by it
 

269
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,870
then if another one comes by it
automatically stacks with it

270
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
automatically stacks with it
 

271
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,150
automatically stacks with it
and totally jams up the farm so that

272
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
and totally jams up the farm so that
 

273
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,430
and totally jams up the farm so that
is a big no-no actually i'm not seeing

274
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
is a big no-no actually i'm not seeing
 

275
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,309
is a big no-no actually i'm not seeing
any pumpkins

276
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
any pumpkins
 

277
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,390
any pumpkins
on the ground here it happens every so

278
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
on the ground here it happens every so
 

279
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,309
on the ground here it happens every so
often but it's not too common

280
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
often but it's not too common
 

281
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,150
often but it's not too common
i could make this more efficient if i

282
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
i could make this more efficient if i
 

283
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,029
i could make this more efficient if i
just like did something like this

284
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
just like did something like this
 

285
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,909
just like did something like this
um but i don't know if i'd like to look

286
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
um but i don't know if i'd like to look
 

287
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,510
um but i don't know if i'd like to look
at that too much so

288
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
at that too much so
 

289
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,590
at that too much so
it doesn't matter that much all right

290
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
it doesn't matter that much all right
 

291
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,550
it doesn't matter that much all right
so the next thing we got to do is get a

292
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
so the next thing we got to do is get a
 

293
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
so the next thing we got to do is get a
farmer villager over here so that we can

294
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240

like every everything every row here is
 

309
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,990
like every everything every row here is
going to be about like a stack of

310
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
going to be about like a stack of
 

311
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,430
going to be about like a stack of
emeralds basically

312

nice and convenient
 

327
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,270
nice and convenient
um probably the best way of getting them

328
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
um probably the best way of getting them
 

329
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,790
um probably the best way of getting them
over here is to

330
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
over here is to
 

331
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,629
over here is to

right and then
 

335
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,350
right and then
see if that works i'm gonna try that

336
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360

850
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
bit
 

851
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,870
bit
because i'm very worried that creeper's

852
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880

855
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,430
gonna land on my head here
and every time i do that it makes me eat

856
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
and every time i do that it makes me eat
 

857
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,870
and every time i do that it makes me eat
one i don't know why

858
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
one i don't know why
 

859
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,990
one i don't know why
you cannot like you cannot give them

860
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
you cannot like you cannot give them
 

861
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,150
you cannot like you cannot give them
the apple without eating one yourself

862
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160

 

863
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,390

well bad news he's a fletcher he's not a

864
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
well bad news he's a fletcher he's not a
 

865
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,270
well bad news he's a fletcher he's not a
farmer

866
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
farmer
 

867
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,190
farmer
so we're gonna have to keep trying here

868
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
so we're gonna have to keep trying here
 

869
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,950
so we're gonna have to keep trying here
i think if i try to convert him again

870
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
i think if i try to convert him again
 

871
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,630
i think if i try to convert him again
he's just going to die like the last one

872
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
he's just going to die like the last one
 

873
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,070
he's just going to die like the last one
so we're going to go ahead with this

874
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
so we're going to go ahead with this
 

875
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,070
so we're going to go ahead with this
infinite breeder idea

876
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
infinite breeder idea
 

877
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,909
infinite breeder idea
uh basically the way these works is

878
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
uh basically the way these works is
 

879
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,270
uh basically the way these works is
pretty simple you need a bunch of

880
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
pretty simple you need a bunch of
 

881
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,710
pretty simple you need a bunch of
farmland

882
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
farmland
 

883
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,789
farmland
in order to make the villagers breed

884
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
in order to make the villagers breed
 

885
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,470
in order to make the villagers breed
they you either have to trade with them

886
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
they you either have to trade with them
 

887
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,310
they you either have to trade with them
or you have to feed them

888
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
or you have to feed them
 

889
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,310
or you have to feed them
and if you put a farmer villager like

890
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
and if you put a farmer villager like
 

891
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,909
and if you put a farmer villager like
that fletcher guy in here he's going to

892
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
that fletcher guy in here he's going to
 

893
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,430
that fletcher guy in here he's going to
harvest the crops

894
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
harvest the crops
 

895
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,590
harvest the crops
feed the other villagers and make the

896
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
feed the other villagers and make the
 

897
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,470
feed the other villagers and make the
babies basically

898
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
babies basically
 

899
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,350
babies basically
alright so we'll put a fence around here

900
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360

 

901
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,909

uh people usually like do solid blocks i

902
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
uh people usually like do solid blocks i
 

903
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,750
uh people usually like do solid blocks i
think that's probably the best but i'm

904
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
think that's probably the best but i'm
 

905
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,750
think that's probably the best but i'm
just gonna try a spruce fence i think

906
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
just gonna try a spruce fence i think
 

907
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,669
just gonna try a spruce fence i think
maybe zombies can attack them through

908
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
maybe zombies can attack them through
 

909
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,510
maybe zombies can attack them through
this i'm not sure though

910
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
this i'm not sure though
 

911
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,630
this i'm not sure though
we'll try it out this this is probably

912
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
we'll try it out this this is probably
 

913
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,230
we'll try it out this this is probably
just going to be a temporary setup we

914
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
just going to be a temporary setup we
 

915
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,230
just going to be a temporary setup we
might set up one permanently though at

916
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
might set up one permanently though at
 

917
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,150
might set up one permanently though at
the library

918
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
the library
 

919
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,789
the library
so we can get some good librarian trades

920
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799

 

921
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,590

all right do all this and then like

922
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
all right do all this and then like
 

923
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,990
all right do all this and then like
i think you need a six block gap if i

924
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
i think you need a six block gap if i
 

925
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,630
i think you need a six block gap if i
remember right

926
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640

 

927
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,350

so one two three four five

928
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360

 

929
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,909

six and then you build a platform or you

930
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
six and then you build a platform or you
 

931
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,710
six and then you build a platform or you
can go below

932
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
can go below
 

933
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,630
can go below
like six blocks below or something uh

934
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
like six blocks below or something uh
 

935
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,390
like six blocks below or something uh
but at this level then you need to put

936
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
but at this level then you need to put
 

937
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,270
but at this level then you need to put
down your doors

938
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
down your doors
 

939
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,669
down your doors
and since these are outside the reach of

940
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
and since these are outside the reach of
 

941
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,270
and since these are outside the reach of
the

942
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
the
 

943
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,150
the
villagers down there they just breed

944
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
villagers down there they just breed
 

945
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,590
villagers down there they just breed
infinitely you got to put a villager up

946
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
infinitely you got to put a villager up
 

947
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,830
infinitely you got to put a villager up
here though as well

948
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
here though as well
 

949
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,190
here though as well
okay and you need i think

950
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
okay and you need i think
 

951
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,789
okay and you need i think
six doors minimum one two

952
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
six doors minimum one two
 

953
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,470
six doors minimum one two
three one two three cover them up so

954
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
three one two three cover them up so
 

955
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,669
three one two three cover them up so
that it counts as

956
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
that it counts as
 

957
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,830
that it counts as
a actual building

958
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
a actual building
 

959
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,510
a actual building
like so and put some walls around here

960
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
like so and put some walls around here
 

961
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,350
like so and put some walls around here
so we got it oh

962
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
so we got it oh
 

963
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,950
so we got it oh
we got to get a villager up here as well

964
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
we got to get a villager up here as well
 

965
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,029
we got to get a villager up here as well
it can be any type though

966
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
it can be any type though
 

967
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,789
it can be any type though
and then we need a farmer one down there

968
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
and then we need a farmer one down there
 

969
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,789
and then we need a farmer one down there
and then whatever other random one we

970
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
and then whatever other random one we
 

971
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,070
and then whatever other random one we
want

972
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
want
 

973
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,230
want
and that should do the trick but it's

974
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
and that should do the trick but it's
 

975
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,590
and that should do the trick but it's
going to take a while for them to really

976
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
going to take a while for them to really
 

977
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,630
going to take a while for them to really
get breeding too

978
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
get breeding too
 

979
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,029
get breeding too
this is not a quick method either

980
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039

 

981
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,070

well this is pretty brutal i've spent a

982
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
well this is pretty brutal i've spent a
 

983
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,909
well this is pretty brutal i've spent a
whole night looking and not a

984
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
whole night looking and not a
 

985
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,750
whole night looking and not a
single zombie villager to be found

986
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760

 

987
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,350

unreal maybe it's not one in ten

988
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
unreal maybe it's not one in ten
 

989
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,669
unreal maybe it's not one in ten
or else maybe i'm just very unlucky but

990
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
or else maybe i'm just very unlucky but
 

991
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,830
or else maybe i'm just very unlucky but
i've had a hard time finding him

992
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840

 

993
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,510

uh i'm trying to get one close to the

994
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
uh i'm trying to get one close to the
 

995
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,350
uh i'm trying to get one close to the
pumpkin farm that way we don't have to

996
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
pumpkin farm that way we don't have to
 

997
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,149
pumpkin farm that way we don't have to
walk them so far but it's not really

998
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
walk them so far but it's not really
 

999
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,310
walk them so far but it's not really
working out too well

1000
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320

 

1001
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,190

is that no those are normal

1002
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
is that no those are normal
