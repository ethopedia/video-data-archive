although Wilson and the Nexus took
 

205
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,480
although Wilson and the Nexus took
longer but yeah let's let's give it a

206
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,490
longer but yeah let's let's give it a
 

207

might recognize this from the Nexus we

214
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:04,169
might recognize this from the Nexus we
 

215
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,800
might recognize this from the Nexus we
have one of each item it's not totally

216
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:06,810
have one of each item it's not totally

filled up here and it's got a few items
 

219
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,120
filled up here and it's got a few items
in right now and on the right here this

220
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,130
in right now and on the right here this
 

221
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,659
in right now and on the right here this
is kind of like our disk drive and the

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:19,770
storage cells if that makes sense so we
 

227
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,650
storage cells if that makes sense so we
can put a bunch of chakra boxes in here

228

the project I'm working on takes more
 

305
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,659
the project I'm working on takes more
than 23 then all I got to do is step on

306

this and now I can get 64 more and that
 

309
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,250
this and now I can get 64 more and that
was all the dirt we have in the system

310
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,260
was all the dirt we have in the system
 

311
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,710
was all the dirt we have in the system
so no more showed up here

312
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
so no more showed up here
 

313
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,320
so no more showed up here
and then after you go through the boxes

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,440
chest so that is pretty cool so yeah
that's the basic idea of it here it's

320
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,450
that's the basic idea of it here it's
 

321
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,779
that's the basic idea of it here it's
really weird storage system right like

322
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:29,789
really weird storage system right like
 

323
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,300
really weird storage system right like
most storage systems are very very

324
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,310
most storage systems are very very
 

325
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,580
most storage systems are very very
structured you have a certain number of

326
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:34,590
structured you have a certain number of
 

327
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,990
structured you have a certain number of
chests certain items go in certain

328
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
chests certain items go in certain
 

329
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,659
chests certain items go in certain
chests and once they're full that's it

330
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:37,669
chests and once they're full that's it
 

331
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,980
chests and once they're full that's it
this is like chaotic and crazy if you

332
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,990
this is like chaotic and crazy if you
 

333
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,480
this is like chaotic and crazy if you
want to add items to the storage room

334
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,490
want to add items to the storage room
 

335
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,340
want to add items to the storage room
you can just drop them off in the chests

336
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,350
you can just drop them off in the chests
 

337
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,490
you can just drop them off in the chests
right or you could just place a box here

338
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,500
right or you could just place a box here
 

339
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,750
right or you could just place a box here
and start filling up up with stuff - the

340
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:53,760
and start filling up up with stuff - the
 

341
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,120
and start filling up up with stuff - the
last thing I built on this was this

342
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,130
last thing I built on this was this
 

343
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,270
last thing I built on this was this
little squisher system so there's a

344
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
little squisher system so there's a
 

345
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,100
little squisher system so there's a
couple kinks I still got to work out one

346
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,110
couple kinks I still got to work out one
 

347
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,770
couple kinks I still got to work out one
problem I'm not liking right now is it

348
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:03,780
problem I'm not liking right now is it
 

349
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,529
problem I'm not liking right now is it
gets stuck in this hopper here so I got

350
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:06,539
gets stuck in this hopper here so I got
 

351
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,110
gets stuck in this hopper here so I got
to step on this twice but I'll probably

352
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
to step on this twice but I'll probably
 

353
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,650
to step on this twice but I'll probably
get those all refined later but yeah

354
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:12,660
get those all refined later but yeah
 

355
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,629
get those all refined later but yeah
that just added torches to the system

356
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
that just added torches to the system
 

357
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,450
that just added torches to the system
you can mix and match items and chests

358
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,460
you can mix and match items and chests
 

359
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,230
you can mix and match items and chests
you can have you know 20 chests of one

360
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
you can have you know 20 chests of one
 

361
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,969
you can have you know 20 chests of one
item you can do whatever you want really

362
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
item you can do whatever you want really
 

363
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,750
item you can do whatever you want really
and also like these are really easy to

364
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:26,760
and also like these are really easy to
 

365
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,540
and also like these are really easy to
move so you could like pump them into a

366
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,550
move so you could like pump them into a
 

367
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,400
move so you could like pump them into a
storage minecart and move them to

368
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,410
storage minecart and move them to
 

369
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,079
storage minecart and move them to
another one of these systems somewhere

370
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,089
another one of these systems somewhere
 

371
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,219
another one of these systems somewhere
else in your worlds

372
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:34,229
else in your worlds
 

373
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,680
else in your worlds
do you like mobile storage that way and

374
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:36,690
do you like mobile storage that way and
 

375
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,899
do you like mobile storage that way and
oh man my mind is just exploding with

376
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:38,909
oh man my mind is just exploding with
 

377
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,019
oh man my mind is just exploding with
awesomeness oh you know I should have

378
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:42,029
awesomeness oh you know I should have
 

379
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,600
awesomeness oh you know I should have
kept one torch darn it so I don't have

380
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,610
kept one torch darn it so I don't have
 

381
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,460
kept one torch darn it so I don't have
that my system in now if we would search

382
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,470
that my system in now if we would search
 

383
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,370
that my system in now if we would search
for torches it's going to go through

384
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,380
for torches it's going to go through
 

385
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,360
for torches it's going to go through
these and it

386
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,370
these and it
 

387
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,450
these and it
pick out the magenta one it goes through

388
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:53,460
pick out the magenta one it goes through
 

389
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,060
pick out the magenta one it goes through
these in a chaotic way as well like to a

390
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,070
these in a chaotic way as well like to a
 

391
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,060
these in a chaotic way as well like to a
certain extent it goes through them

392
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,070
certain extent it goes through them
 

393
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,490
certain extent it goes through them
whatever is first here but then it also

394
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:01,500
whatever is first here but then it also
 

395
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,620
whatever is first here but then it also
goes through droppers so it randomizes a

396
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:03,630
goes through droppers so it randomizes a
 

397
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,980
goes through droppers so it randomizes a
little bit and as soon as it's found it

398
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:06,990
little bit and as soon as it's found it
 

399
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,840
little bit and as soon as it's found it
shows up here so sometimes you get more

400
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:08,850
shows up here so sometimes you get more
 

401
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,430
shows up here so sometimes you get more
lucky than other times and it shows up

402
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
lucky than other times and it shows up
 

403
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,200
lucky than other times and it shows up
sooner than other times but yeah pretty

404
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,210
sooner than other times but yeah pretty
 

405
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,360
sooner than other times but yeah pretty
cool stuff let's do a couple more things

406
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,370
cool stuff let's do a couple more things
 

407
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:24,670
cool stuff let's do a couple more things
here another thing about the system so

408
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,680
here another thing about the system so
 

409
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,290
here another thing about the system so
let's see do we have it I think one

410
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
let's see do we have it I think one
 

411
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,920
let's see do we have it I think one
chest at glassing let's search for glass

412
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:29,930
chest at glassing let's search for glass
 

413
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,970
chest at glassing let's search for glass
the last thing we searched for was

414
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:31,980
the last thing we searched for was
 

415
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,100
the last thing we searched for was
torches so that search item should come

416
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,110
torches so that search item should come
 

417
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,260
torches so that search item should come
back in this chest there it is right

418
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,270
back in this chest there it is right
 

419
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,560
back in this chest there it is right
there so it dis cycles through them they

420
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:39,570
there so it dis cycles through them they
 

421
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,990
there so it dis cycles through them they
end up in the bottom chest first and

422
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
end up in the bottom chest first and
 

423
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,460
end up in the bottom chest first and
this one then this one this one they

424
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,470
this one then this one this one they
 

425
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,100
this one then this one this one they
fill up as they go huh

426
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,110
fill up as they go huh
 

427
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,500
fill up as they go huh
pretty cool I guess this gives you a

428
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,510
pretty cool I guess this gives you a
 

429
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,960
pretty cool I guess this gives you a
chance of pulling it out too

430
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:53,970
chance of pulling it out too
 

431
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,940
chance of pulling it out too
the other thing is the hopper below this

432
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:55,950
the other thing is the hopper below this
 

433
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,500
the other thing is the hopper below this
is locked so if you wanted to take this

434
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,510
is locked so if you wanted to take this
 

435
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,300
is locked so if you wanted to take this
chest with you you can do that too it's

436
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,310
chest with you you can do that too it's
 

437
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,130
chest with you you can do that too it's
another option and then bring it back

438
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,140
another option and then bring it back
 

439
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,180
another option and then bring it back
later if you want

440
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,190
later if you want
 

441
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,480
later if you want
oh yeah and hopefully you guys don't

442
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,490
oh yeah and hopefully you guys don't
 

443
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,980
oh yeah and hopefully you guys don't
mind but today's probably gonna be just

444
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:06,990
mind but today's probably gonna be just
 

445
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,960
mind but today's probably gonna be just
a Show and Tell episode a little bit of

446
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:08,970
a Show and Tell episode a little bit of
 

447
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,079
a Show and Tell episode a little bit of
an odd oddball episode usually we we

448
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,089
an odd oddball episode usually we we
 

449
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,880
an odd oddball episode usually we we
build stuff together but I mostly just

450
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:13,890
build stuff together but I mostly just
 

451
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,030
build stuff together but I mostly just
want to show off the system so yeah got

452
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
want to show off the system so yeah got
 

453
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,070
want to show off the system so yeah got
a lot to talk about still okay let's

454
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,080
a lot to talk about still okay let's
 

455
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,470
a lot to talk about still okay let's
keep going here you might be wondering

456
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,480
keep going here you might be wondering
 

457
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,750
keep going here you might be wondering
what's on the left here absolutely

458
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
what's on the left here absolutely
 

459
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,510
what's on the left here absolutely
nothing this is just there for symmetry

460
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:26,520
nothing this is just there for symmetry
 

461
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,269
nothing this is just there for symmetry
right now but it might be used later for

462
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
right now but it might be used later for
 

463
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,630
right now but it might be used later for
a feature I have planned kind of an

464
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
a feature I have planned kind of an
 

465
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,550
a feature I have planned kind of an
afterthought I had was it would be cool

466
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
afterthought I had was it would be cool
 

467
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,350
afterthought I had was it would be cool
if this only showed the items in the

468
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,360
if this only showed the items in the
 

469
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,310
if this only showed the items in the
system not just like everything you know

470
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,320
system not just like everything you know
 

471
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,540
system not just like everything you know
so if I can't make that work with this

472
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,550
so if I can't make that work with this
 

473
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,310
so if I can't make that work with this
middle chest I might make it work over

474
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:43,320
middle chest I might make it work over
 

475
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,250
middle chest I might make it work over
here well show one of each item in the

476
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,260
here well show one of each item in the
 

477
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,250
here well show one of each item in the
system you know could be a cool thing or

478

system you know could be a cool thing or
 

479
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,590
system you know could be a cool thing or
we might have empty chests go into here

480
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
we might have empty chests go into here
 

481
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,840
we might have empty chests go into here
or something of that nature I'm sure

482
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
or something of that nature I'm sure
 

483
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,840
or something of that nature I'm sure
I'll get used for something though we

484
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:56,850
I'll get used for something though we
 

485
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,460
I'll get used for something though we
haven't really seen the Redstone yet so

486
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:58,470
haven't really seen the Redstone yet so
 

487
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,170
haven't really seen the Redstone yet so
let's get this running and we'll try to

488
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,180
let's get this running and we'll try to
 

489
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,140
let's get this running and we'll try to
catch it in action search for bones I

490
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,150
catch it in action search for bones I
 

491
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,160
catch it in action search for bones I
suppose

492
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,170
suppose
 

493
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,749
suppose
over over here was a pretty good view

494
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:06,759
over over here was a pretty good view
 

495
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,720
over over here was a pretty good view
and see there's two sets of Pistons

496
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,730
and see there's two sets of Pistons
 

497
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,240
and see there's two sets of Pistons
doing things there and then there's also

498
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,250
doing things there and then there's also
 

499
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,869
doing things there and then there's also
a bunch of item elevators going on to

500
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:15,879
a bunch of item elevators going on to
 

501
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,550
a bunch of item elevators going on to
get the items back to the top of the

502
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,560
get the items back to the top of the
 

503
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,840
get the items back to the top of the
chest to raise this Manion barely sees

these item elevators this one over here

506
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:27,579
these item elevators this one over here
 

507
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,059
these item elevators this one over here
is for that the item filters though the

508
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:30,069
is for that the item filters though the
 

509
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,220
is for that the item filters though the
the middle chest stuff this one over

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,230
the middle chest stuff this one over
 

511
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,540
the middle chest stuff this one over
here is for the shocker box main oh oh

512
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:38,550
here is for the shocker box main oh oh
 

513
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:49,249
here is for the shocker box main oh oh
well oh oh no we might have a problem oh

514
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:49,259
well oh oh no we might have a problem oh
 

515
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,129
well oh oh no we might have a problem oh
no really

516
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:52,139
no really
 

517
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,900
no really
mm-hmm wonder if that has to do with

518
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:54,910
mm-hmm wonder if that has to do with
 

519
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,249
mm-hmm wonder if that has to do with
piston translocation I'm still in 39 see

520
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:01,259
piston translocation I'm still in 39 see
 

521
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,389
piston translocation I'm still in 39 see
there's a chance it might work in the

522
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:03,399
there's a chance it might work in the
 

523
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,460
there's a chance it might work in the
next version oh snap I don't really want

524
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,470
next version oh snap I don't really want
 

525
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,059
next version oh snap I don't really want
to update though kind of seemed like it

526
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:12,069
to update though kind of seemed like it
 

527
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:14,009
to update though kind of seemed like it
came out of this item elevator here

528
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:14,019
came out of this item elevator here
 

529
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,650
came out of this item elevator here
there we go hello what oh I'm gonna have

530
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:19,660
there we go hello what oh I'm gonna have
 

531
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,059
there we go hello what oh I'm gonna have
to watch that video back just to see

532
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:21,069
to watch that video back just to see
 

533
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,740
to watch that video back just to see
what happened there it definitely came

534
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:22,750
what happened there it definitely came
 

535
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,220
what happened there it definitely came
out item elevator right like somewhere

536
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,230
out item elevator right like somewhere
 

537
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,519
out item elevator right like somewhere
around here maybe because I put a piston

538
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:29,529
around here maybe because I put a piston
 

539
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,660
around here maybe because I put a piston
here that might have been a mistake

540
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:32,670
here that might have been a mistake
 

541
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,189
here that might have been a mistake
yup so I just double checked and it's

542
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:35,199
yup so I just double checked and it's
 

543
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,230
yup so I just double checked and it's
definitely the Pistons that are causing

544
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,240
definitely the Pistons that are causing
 

545
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,780
definitely the Pistons that are causing
the problem so I think I'm just gonna

546
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,790
the problem so I think I'm just gonna
 

547
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,269
the problem so I think I'm just gonna
wait and not fix that problem cuz if you

548
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:42,279
wait and not fix that problem cuz if you
 

549
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,030
wait and not fix that problem cuz if you
didn't know in the 40 snapshots they

550
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
didn't know in the 40 snapshots they
 

551
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,259
didn't know in the 40 snapshots they
have removed or changed or fixed or what

552
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:49,269
have removed or changed or fixed or what
 

553
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,689
have removed or changed or fixed or what
however you want to call it I'm gonna

554
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:51,699
however you want to call it I'm gonna
 

555
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:56,400
however you want to call it I'm gonna
say removed piston translocation a lot

556
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,410
say removed piston translocation a lot
 

557
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,410
say removed piston translocation a lot
of people consider it a bug I saw it

558
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:58,420
of people consider it a bug I saw it
 

559
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,990
of people consider it a bug I saw it
more as a feature but there's a chance

560
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,000
more as a feature but there's a chance
 

561
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,670
more as a feature but there's a chance
this will just work in the next update

562
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,680
this will just work in the next update
 

563
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,980
this will just work in the next update
I'm not gonna update though because it

564
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:04,990
I'm not gonna update though because it
 

565
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,600
I'm not gonna update though because it
is buggy from what I've heard yeah like

566
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,610
is buggy from what I've heard yeah like
 

567
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,429
is buggy from what I've heard yeah like
oh my a lot of my elevators in this

568
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:11,439
oh my a lot of my elevators in this
 

569
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,689
oh my a lot of my elevators in this
world are gonna be broken because they

570
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:12,699
world are gonna be broken because they
 

571
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,370
world are gonna be broken because they
got rid of piston translocation so I'm

572
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:14,380
got rid of piston translocation so I'm
 

573
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,379
got rid of piston translocation so I'm
not super happy about that to be honest

574
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:16,389
not super happy about that to be honest
 

575
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,009
not super happy about that to be honest
yes it'll fix this one

576
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:18,019
yes it'll fix this one
 

577
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,689
yes it'll fix this one
a problem I'm having but I could just

578
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:19,699
a problem I'm having but I could just
 

579
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,769
a problem I'm having but I could just
redesign this and move the piston over

580
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:22,779
redesign this and move the piston over
 

581
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,259
redesign this and move the piston over
kind of a small thing or I could have to

582
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:26,269
kind of a small thing or I could have to
 

583
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,389
kind of a small thing or I could have to
redo a bunch of stuff in my world

584
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
redo a bunch of stuff in my world
 

585
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,069
redo a bunch of stuff in my world
fix my zombie pigmen farm and Mojang

586
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:35,079
fix my zombie pigmen farm and Mojang
 

587
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,119
fix my zombie pigmen farm and Mojang
anyways so yeah let's look down below

588
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:40,129
anyways so yeah let's look down below
 

589
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:43,449
anyways so yeah let's look down below
here the bulk of this thing here is the

590
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:43,459
here the bulk of this thing here is the
 

591
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,460
here the bulk of this thing here is the
search engine the search engine is like

592
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,470
search engine the search engine is like
 

593
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,579
search engine the search engine is like
a seven by seven by seven box of of

594
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:48,589
a seven by seven by seven box of of
 

595
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:52,329
a seven by seven by seven box of of
redstone hoppers Pistons and and stuff

596
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:52,339
redstone hoppers Pistons and and stuff
 

597
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,079
redstone hoppers Pistons and and stuff
like that its job is to go through the

598
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,089
like that its job is to go through the
 

599
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,889
like that its job is to go through the
shocker boxes check if the item matches

600
00:13:59,889 --> 00:13:59,899
shocker boxes check if the item matches
 

601
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,210
shocker boxes check if the item matches
the filter if it does then it goes one

602
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,220
the filter if it does then it goes one
 

603
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,400
the filter if it does then it goes one
into one chest if it doesn't it goes

604
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,410
into one chest if it doesn't it goes
 

605
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,739
into one chest if it doesn't it goes
into another chest so it splits the

606
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:08,749
into another chest so it splits the
 

607
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,160
into another chest so it splits the
Shanker boxes the way it does that is

608
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,170
Shanker boxes the way it does that is
 

609
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,799
Shanker boxes the way it does that is
actually pretty tricky stuff though

610
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:14,809
actually pretty tricky stuff though
 

611
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,650
actually pretty tricky stuff though
let's see if I can set up an example to

612
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:17,660
let's see if I can set up an example to
 

613
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,100
let's see if I can set up an example to
show you all right so very cool guys so

614
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,110
show you all right so very cool guys so
 

615
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,329
show you all right so very cool guys so
we're gonna be looking at a couple

616
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:22,339
we're gonna be looking at a couple
 

617
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,460
we're gonna be looking at a couple
tricks here I used to make that system

618
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,470
tricks here I used to make that system
 

619
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,509
tricks here I used to make that system
in case you're interested so I'm sure a

620
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:28,519
in case you're interested so I'm sure a
 

621
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,220
in case you're interested so I'm sure a
lot of you are familiar with item

622
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,230
lot of you are familiar with item
 

623
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,400
lot of you are familiar with item
filters like we have here concept is

624
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,410
filters like we have here concept is
 

625
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,460
filters like we have here concept is
pretty simple if the item you throw it

626
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,470
pretty simple if the item you throw it
 

627
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,619
pretty simple if the item you throw it
it matches the filter in the hopper can

628
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:38,629
it matches the filter in the hopper can
 

629
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,230
it matches the filter in the hopper can
pick it up so we don't have glass in

630
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,240
pick it up so we don't have glass in
 

631
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,879
pick it up so we don't have glass in
here it's not picking up the glass but

632
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:42,889
here it's not picking up the glass but
 

633
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,249
here it's not picking up the glass but
if we throw a ladder at it that can go

634
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:45,259
if we throw a ladder at it that can go
 

635
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,660
if we throw a ladder at it that can go
inside because that's what we're looking

636
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:46,670
inside because that's what we're looking
 

637
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,100
inside because that's what we're looking
for

638
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,110
for
 

639
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,169
for
likewise if we put a shocker box on top

640
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:50,179
likewise if we put a shocker box on top
 

641
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,829
likewise if we put a shocker box on top
of here it combos pretty well spruce

642
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
of here it combos pretty well spruce
 

643
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,629
of here it combos pretty well spruce
wood is not in the filter so it's not

644
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:55,639
wood is not in the filter so it's not
 

645
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,280
wood is not in the filter so it's not
getting pulled out but if we put ladders

646
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,290
getting pulled out but if we put ladders
 

647
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,799
getting pulled out but if we put ladders
in the chest or if it had ladders in

648
00:14:59,799 --> 00:14:59,809
in the chest or if it had ladders in
 

649
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,460
in the chest or if it had ladders in
already then it will pull the ladders

650
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,470
already then it will pull the ladders
 

651
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,429
already then it will pull the ladders
out right so what I do with our search

652
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:06,439
out right so what I do with our search
 

653
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,419
out right so what I do with our search
engine I give it time to allow one item

654
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:10,429
engine I give it time to allow one item
 

655
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,309
engine I give it time to allow one item
to pass through into the filter if it

656
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:12,319
to pass through into the filter if it
 

657
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:15,789
to pass through into the filter if it
does I know the shocker box has the item

658
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:15,799
does I know the shocker box has the item
 

659
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,900
does I know the shocker box has the item
we're looking for alright so that is the

660
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:19,910
we're looking for alright so that is the
 

661
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,470
we're looking for alright so that is the
first step the second step is we need a

662
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:23,480
first step the second step is we need a
 

663
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,400
first step the second step is we need a
way of changing the item filter which is

664
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,410
way of changing the item filter which is
 

665
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,309
way of changing the item filter which is
actually a really trivial thing to do

666
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:29,319
actually a really trivial thing to do
 

667
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,210
actually a really trivial thing to do
surprisingly I thought that is gonna be

668
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,220
surprisingly I thought that is gonna be
 

669
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,730
surprisingly I thought that is gonna be
hard

670
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:31,740
hard
 

671
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,570
hard
do what you got to do is just queue up

672
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:34,580
do what you got to do is just queue up
 

673
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,450
do what you got to do is just queue up
another item like a slime block

674
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,460
another item like a slime block
 

675
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,880
another item like a slime block
slime ball so from that middle chest

676
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:40,890
slime ball so from that middle chest
 

677
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,560
slime ball so from that middle chest
whenever I throw an item in this is

678
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:42,570
whenever I throw an item in this is
 

679
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,450
whenever I throw an item in this is
basically what it's doing it it goes

680
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:44,460
basically what it's doing it it goes
 

681
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,120
basically what it's doing it it goes
into a queue and then I unpowered this

682
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,130
into a queue and then I unpowered this
 

683
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,110
into a queue and then I unpowered this
for a moment like so and then it

684
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
for a moment like so and then it
 

685
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,640
for a moment like so and then it
switches so it's no longer a ladder

686
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:52,650
switches so it's no longer a ladder
 

687
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,180
switches so it's no longer a ladder
filter it's a slime ball filter right

688
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,190
filter it's a slime ball filter right
 

689
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,530
filter it's a slime ball filter right
the tricky thing is like getting this

690
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,540
the tricky thing is like getting this
 

691
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,960
the tricky thing is like getting this
out of here afterwards but we're not

692
00:15:59,960 --> 00:15:59,970
out of here afterwards but we're not
 

693
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,580
out of here afterwards but we're not
gonna look at that not right now anyway

694
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:03,590
gonna look at that not right now anyway
 

695
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,810
gonna look at that not right now anyway
yeah so the basic gist of the whole

696
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:05,820
yeah so the basic gist of the whole
 

697
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,080
yeah so the basic gist of the whole
system is we have a dispenser that

698
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,090
system is we have a dispenser that
 

699
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,760
system is we have a dispenser that
receives the shocker boxes if there's

700
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:10,770
receives the shocker boxes if there's
 

701
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,490
receives the shocker boxes if there's
any inside the dispenser o'clock runs it

702
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
any inside the dispenser o'clock runs it
 

703
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,520
any inside the dispenser o'clock runs it
makes the shocker boxes get objected on

704
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,530
makes the shocker boxes get objected on
 

705
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,120
makes the shocker boxes get objected on
top of the hopper all right we keep this

706
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,130
top of the hopper all right we keep this
 

707
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,190
top of the hopper all right we keep this
powered until we want to check for an

708
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,200
powered until we want to check for an
 

709
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,970
powered until we want to check for an
item so we just flip this real quick we

710
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:25,980
item so we just flip this real quick we
 

711
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,490
item so we just flip this real quick we
can see one one spruce wood left the

712
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:28,500
can see one one spruce wood left the
 

713
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,250
can see one one spruce wood left the
Shocker box into the item filter so we

714
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,260
Shocker box into the item filter so we
 

715
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,130
Shocker box into the item filter so we
know this has spruce wood in and then we

716
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,140
know this has spruce wood in and then we
 

717
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,800
know this has spruce wood in and then we
break this I had another like hopper

718
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:39,810
break this I had another like hopper
 

719
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,650
break this I had another like hopper
over here to pick it up just so

720
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:41,660
over here to pick it up just so
 

721
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,440
over here to pick it up just so
simplifies things a little bits yeah we

722
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,450
simplifies things a little bits yeah we
 

723
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,900
simplifies things a little bits yeah we
break that goes into here and then it

724
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:47,910
break that goes into here and then it
 

725
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,940
break that goes into here and then it
goes into another dispenser a different

726
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:49,950
goes into another dispenser a different
 

727
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,850
goes into another dispenser a different
one and we place it again basically do

728
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:52,860
one and we place it again basically do
 

729
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,700
one and we place it again basically do
the same thing again the reason we do

730
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:55,710
the same thing again the reason we do
 

731
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,590
the same thing again the reason we do
this in two steps is just so it's faster

732
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
this in two steps is just so it's faster
 

733
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,330
this in two steps is just so it's faster
all right but at the second step what we

734
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,340
all right but at the second step what we
 

735
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,220
all right but at the second step what we
do is we use a dropper to replace the

736
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,230
do is we use a dropper to replace the
 

737
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,960
do is we use a dropper to replace the
item we took out of there so we took one

738
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:08,970
item we took out of there so we took one
 

739
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,690
item we took out of there so we took one
spruce wood out we need to get it back

740
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:11,700
spruce wood out we need to get it back
 

741
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,840
spruce wood out we need to get it back
in some way otherwise every time I go

742
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:14,850
in some way otherwise every time I go
 

743
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,490
in some way otherwise every time I go
through the search you'd lose an item in

744
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:16,500
through the search you'd lose an item in
 

745
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,380
through the search you'd lose an item in
one of the chests right we got to get

746
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,390
one of the chests right we got to get
 

747
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,480
one of the chests right we got to get
that back into there and then we break

748
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,490
that back into there and then we break
 

749
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,240
that back into there and then we break
it again and based on whether or not we

750
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,250
it again and based on whether or not we
 

751
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,820
it again and based on whether or not we
detected the item we're looking for in

752
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:28,830
detected the item we're looking for in
 

753
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,550
detected the item we're looking for in
the filter we send it one way or else we

754
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:31,560
the filter we send it one way or else we
 

755
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,280
the filter we send it one way or else we
send it another way and to do that I had

756
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,290
send it another way and to do that I had
 

757
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,430
send it another way and to do that I had
to use hopper junctions which is an idea

758
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
to use hopper junctions which is an idea
 

759
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,880
to use hopper junctions which is an idea
I've never thought of or used before

760
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:42,890
I've never thought of or used before
 

761
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,040
I've never thought of or used before
let's see

762
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,050
let's see
 

763
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,810
let's see
it's actually really simple as well but

764
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:46,820
it's actually really simple as well but
 

765
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,160
it's actually really simple as well but
basically you do something like this

766
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,170
basically you do something like this
 

767
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,510
basically you do something like this
right and you want to keep this powered

768
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
right and you want to keep this powered
 

769
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,180
right and you want to keep this powered
over here at the junction right so if we

770
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,190
over here at the junction right so if we
 

771
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,000
over here at the junction right so if we
put dirt through here it's gonna go to

772
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,010
put dirt through here it's gonna go to
 

773
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,790
put dirt through here it's gonna go to
the left hopefully no I

774
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:06,800
the left hopefully no I
 

775
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,860
the left hopefully no I
oh no I'm powering the wrong one got a

776
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:08,870
oh no I'm powering the wrong one got a
 

777
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,440
oh no I'm powering the wrong one got a
power this one down here okay

778
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,450
power this one down here okay
 

779
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,720
power this one down here okay
so now using redstone we can choose

780
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,730
so now using redstone we can choose
 

781
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,200
so now using redstone we can choose
which way the dirt goes pretty easily

782
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,210
which way the dirt goes pretty easily
 

783
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,180
which way the dirt goes pretty easily
because it pulls down before it goes

784
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,190
because it pulls down before it goes
 

785
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,200
because it pulls down before it goes
sideways is the idea so this will

786
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,210
sideways is the idea so this will
 

787
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,640
sideways is the idea so this will
because it's powered it can't pull down

788
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,650
because it's powered it can't pull down
 

789
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,250
because it's powered it can't pull down
so it's gonna go down to here if we

790
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,260
so it's gonna go down to here if we
 

791
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,140
so it's gonna go down to here if we
remove this so then it can start taking

792
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,150
remove this so then it can start taking
 

793
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,020
remove this so then it can start taking
them and it doesn't go here so you can

794
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,030
them and it doesn't go here so you can
 

795
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,130
them and it doesn't go here so you can
control which way the Shocker boxes go

796
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,140
control which way the Shocker boxes go
 

797
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,720
control which way the Shocker boxes go
using that trick as well okay so we're

798
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,730
using that trick as well okay so we're
 

799
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,549
using that trick as well okay so we're
back at our system here guys I'm not

800
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
back at our system here guys I'm not
 

801
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,290
back at our system here guys I'm not
gonna go through every single detail

802
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:44,300
gonna go through every single detail
 

803
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,320
gonna go through every single detail
with the redstone but I will show you

804
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,330
with the redstone but I will show you
 

805
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,790
with the redstone but I will show you
those main concepts how I built them

806
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:48,800
those main concepts how I built them
 

807
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,010
those main concepts how I built them
here now that we understand them so this

808
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,020
here now that we understand them so this
 

809
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,080
here now that we understand them so this
is our first dispenser places the

810
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,090
is our first dispenser places the
 

811
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,440
is our first dispenser places the
Shanker box that hopper over there is

812
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,450
Shanker box that hopper over there is
 

813
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,440
Shanker box that hopper over there is
the item filter and the piston breaks

814
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,450
the item filter and the piston breaks
 

815
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,020
the item filter and the piston breaks
it's afterwards yeah if we checked here

816
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,030
it's afterwards yeah if we checked here
 

817
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,600
it's afterwards yeah if we checked here
this is our item filter on the side here

818
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,610
this is our item filter on the side here
 

819
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,020
this is our item filter on the side here
is the cue to switch out the item and

820
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,030
is the cue to switch out the item and
 

821
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,970
is the cue to switch out the item and
you see we got a bunch of hoppers below

822
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:09,980
you see we got a bunch of hoppers below
 

823
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,299
you see we got a bunch of hoppers below
that is a hopper junction to get that

824
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:13,309
that is a hopper junction to get that
 

825
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,890
that is a hopper junction to get that
item out of there and then who can we

826
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:17,900
item out of there and then who can we
 

827
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,650
item out of there and then who can we
find our way through here it is very

828
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:20,660
find our way through here it is very
 

829
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,890
find our way through here it is very
very tight over here yeah over here is

830
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:23,900
very tight over here yeah over here is
 

831
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,390
very tight over here yeah over here is
the second step so this is the other

832
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:25,400
the second step so this is the other
 

833
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,880
the second step so this is the other
dispenser with the dropper to put the

834
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:27,890
dispenser with the dropper to put the
 

835
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,580
dispenser with the dropper to put the
item back in that we took out and then

836
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,590
item back in that we took out and then
 

837
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,320
item back in that we took out and then
the piston breaks it again pushes it

838
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,330
the piston breaks it again pushes it
 

839
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,590
the piston breaks it again pushes it
over to that hopper there and can we get

840
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
over to that hopper there and can we get
 

841
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,590
over to that hopper there and can we get
through here yeah so again we have a

842
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:38,600
through here yeah so again we have a
 

843
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,770
through here yeah so again we have a
hopper junction so if we found a match

844
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:41,780
hopper junction so if we found a match
 

845
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,020
hopper junction so if we found a match
if the Shocker box matched the item

846
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,030
if the Shocker box matched the item
 

847
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,200
if the Shocker box matched the item
filter then we unpowered this redstone

848
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,210
filter then we unpowered this redstone
 

849
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,930
filter then we unpowered this redstone
torch here the items goes or the Shocker

850
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:52,940
torch here the items goes or the Shocker
 

851
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,780
torch here the items goes or the Shocker
box goes down into this item elevator up

852
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:55,790
box goes down into this item elevator up
 

853
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,480
box goes down into this item elevator up
to our our thingy there otherwise it

854
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,490
to our our thingy there otherwise it
 

855
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,170
to our our thingy there otherwise it
goes to the

856
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,180
goes to the
 

857
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,270
goes to the
here and back into the main loop into

858
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
here and back into the main loop into
 

859
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,580
here and back into the main loop into
the storage boxes yeah that is how we

860
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:05,590
the storage boxes yeah that is how we
 

861
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,760
the storage boxes yeah that is how we
separate them uh-huh all right guys I'm

862
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:09,770
separate them uh-huh all right guys I'm
 

863
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,470
separate them uh-huh all right guys I'm
losing my voice here unfortunately I'm

864
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:11,480
losing my voice here unfortunately I'm
 

865
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,060
losing my voice here unfortunately I'm
kind of out of it I've spent too long

866
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,070
kind of out of it I've spent too long
 

867
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,640
kind of out of it I've spent too long
building this there's not going to be a

868
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:15,650
building this there's not going to be a
 

869
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,080
building this there's not going to be a
tutorial on this

870
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,090
tutorial on this
 

871
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,080
tutorial on this
I've decided just for a couple reasons

872
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,090
I've decided just for a couple reasons
 

873
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,780
I've decided just for a couple reasons
mainly because like when I built this

874
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:22,790
mainly because like when I built this
 

875
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,460
mainly because like when I built this
from creative into our world here it

876
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,470
from creative into our world here it
 

877
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,010
from creative into our world here it
took me an hour and a half I knew what I

878
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,020
took me an hour and a half I knew what I
 

879
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,740
took me an hour and a half I knew what I
was doing it like I had the world on the

880
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:29,750
was doing it like I had the world on the
 

881
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,450
was doing it like I had the world on the
other screen as copying it blocked

882
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,460
other screen as copying it blocked
 

883
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,980
other screen as copying it blocked
four-block hour and a half to build this

884
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:34,990
four-block hour and a half to build this
 

885
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,210
four-block hour and a half to build this
so that means the tutorial would be an

886
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,220
so that means the tutorial would be an
 

887
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,590
so that means the tutorial would be an
hour and a half and nobody's gonna watch

888
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:38,600
hour and a half and nobody's gonna watch
 

889
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,860
hour and a half and nobody's gonna watch
an hour and a half tutorial also while

890
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:41,870
an hour and a half tutorial also while
 

891
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,200
an hour and a half tutorial also while
building it I made a bunch of mistakes

892
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,210
building it I made a bunch of mistakes
 

893
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,640
building it I made a bunch of mistakes
which you guys will too if I make a

894
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,650
which you guys will too if I make a
 

895
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,320
which you guys will too if I make a
tutorial and then I'll have a bunch of

896
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,330
tutorial and then I'll have a bunch of
 

897
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,140
tutorial and then I'll have a bunch of
Rage comments oh this doesn't work you

898
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,150
Rage comments oh this doesn't work you
 

899
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,980
Rage comments oh this doesn't work you
wasted my time

900
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:50,990
wasted my time
 

901
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,800
wasted my time
because even in normal tutorials you get

902
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:53,810
because even in normal tutorials you get
 

903
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,100
because even in normal tutorials you get
that and this thing is like pretty

904
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,110
that and this thing is like pretty
 

905
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,520
that and this thing is like pretty
tricky to build so what I would do

906
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,530
tricky to build so what I would do
 

907
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,560
tricky to build so what I would do
instead if you guys really really want

908
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,570
instead if you guys really really want
 

909
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,600
instead if you guys really really want
to see this soon I'll try to get a world

910
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:04,610
to see this soon I'll try to get a world
 

911
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,880
to see this soon I'll try to get a world
download up and then you just copy it

912
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:06,890
download up and then you just copy it
 

913
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,250
download up and then you just copy it
out of the world or check it out in the

914
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,260
out of the world or check it out in the
 

915
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,660
out of the world or check it out in the
world or do whatever you want with it

916
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:10,670
world or do whatever you want with it
 

917
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,890
world or do whatever you want with it
but yeah it's gonna be too tricky to go

918
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:14,900
but yeah it's gonna be too tricky to go
 

919
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,830
but yeah it's gonna be too tricky to go
over every little detail I think so yeah

920
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
over every little detail I think so yeah
 

921
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,930
over every little detail I think so yeah
just kind of wanted to show it off today

922
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:19,940
just kind of wanted to show it off today
