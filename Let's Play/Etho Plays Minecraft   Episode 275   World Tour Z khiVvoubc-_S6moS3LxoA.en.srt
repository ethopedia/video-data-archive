399
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,710
i used to have a hoe in here that i
would use to re-till this that would get

400
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
would use to re-till this that would get
 

401
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,469
would use to re-till this that would get
shot out when we enter

402
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
shot out when we enter
 

403
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,430
shot out when we enter
and it doesn't do that anymore well it

404

and it doesn't do that anymore well it
 

405
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,309
and it doesn't do that anymore well it
could

406
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
could
 

407
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,909
could
if we put something in here it'll still

408
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
if we put something in here it'll still
 

409
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,550
if we put something in here it'll still
shoot it out

410
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560

 

411
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,909

but uh the way i built this it's

412
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
but uh the way i built this it's
 

413
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,790
but uh the way i built this it's
in the past if you walked on tilled soil

414
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
in the past if you walked on tilled soil
 

415

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,790
and that kills the lights when they're
being powered

508
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
being powered
 

509
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,990
being powered
and this has gone through

510
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
and this has gone through
 

511
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,030
and this has gone through
quite a few changes over

512
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
quite a few changes over
 

513
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,470
quite a few changes over
over time uh go back

514
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
over time uh go back
 

515
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,030
over time uh go back
here if we can go back here

516
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040

 

517
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,829

there's a whole bunch of wiring a lot of

518
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
there's a whole bunch of wiring a lot of
 

519
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,990
there's a whole bunch of wiring a lot of
this can be redone so much simpler

520
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
this can be redone so much simpler
 

521
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,190
this can be redone so much simpler
now too it's it's almost hard to look at

522
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
now too it's it's almost hard to look at
 

523
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,990
now too it's it's almost hard to look at
it

524
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
it
 

525
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,550
it
uh this is a big timer thing i had it

526
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
uh this is a big timer thing i had it
 

527
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,949
uh this is a big timer thing i had it
set up so if i hit a button

528
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
set up so if i hit a button
 

529
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,069
set up so if i hit a button
it would start a one minute

530
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
it would start a one minute
 

531
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,350
it would start a one minute
timer or not one a one hour timer here

532
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
timer or not one a one hour timer here
 

533
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,110
timer or not one a one hour timer here
uh just a whole bunch of five minute

534
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
uh just a whole bunch of five minute
 

535
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,350
uh just a whole bunch of five minute
timers chained together

536
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
timers chained together
 

537
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,430
timers chained together
and the point of that was so if i went

538
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
and the point of that was so if i went
 

539
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,630
and the point of that was so if i went
afk

540
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
afk
 

541
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,230
afk
i wouldn't accidentally spawn like

542
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
i wouldn't accidentally spawn like
 

543
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,990
i wouldn't accidentally spawn like
thousands and thousands of spiders

544
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
thousands and thousands of spiders
 

545
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,670
thousands and thousands of spiders
in my world here and then corrupt the

546
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
in my world here and then corrupt the
 

547
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,069
in my world here and then corrupt the
world when it when they

548
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
world when it when they
 

549
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,910
world when it when they
when they cause it to crash you know

550
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
when they cause it to crash you know
 

551
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,750
when they cause it to crash you know
which was uh happening to me

552
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
which was uh happening to me
 

553
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,949
which was uh happening to me
quite a bit actually

554
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959

 

555
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,870

so that's the point of all this and

556
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
so that's the point of all this and
 

557
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,990
so that's the point of all this and
there's also

558
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
there's also
 

559
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,350
there's also
an override button to it i think if we

560
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
an override button to it i think if we
 

561
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,750
an override button to it i think if we
press it it will turn on the spawners

562
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760

 

563
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,829

yeah okay i'm gonna redo this though

564
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
yeah okay i'm gonna redo this though
 

565
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,750
yeah okay i'm gonna redo this though
sometime in the future and i'm i think

566
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
sometime in the future and i'm i think
 

567
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,990
sometime in the future and i'm i think
i'm just gonna make the spiders fall

568
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
i'm just gonna make the spiders fall
 

569
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,990
i'm just gonna make the spiders fall
and collect the string from them because

570
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
and collect the string from them because
 

571
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,350
and collect the string from them because
that's all i would really want for them

572
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
that's all i would really want for them
 

573
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,030
that's all i would really want for them
i have better experience farms

574
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,040
i have better experience farms
 

575
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,350
i have better experience farms
nowadays uh

576
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
nowadays uh
 

577
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,430
nowadays uh
this was really cool back in the day

578
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
this was really cool back in the day
 

579
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,630
this was really cool back in the day
though like this was

580
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
though like this was
 

581
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,710
though like this was
i built this when enchanting first came

582
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
i built this when enchanting first came
 

583
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,069
i built this when enchanting first came
out and

584
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
out and
 

585
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,190
out and
at that time like

586
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
at that time like
 

587
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,190
at that time like
using spawners for experience wasn't

588
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
using spawners for experience wasn't
 

589
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,230
using spawners for experience wasn't
really a thing like people had

590
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
really a thing like people had
 

591
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,509
really a thing like people had
had like a zombie and and skeleton

592
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
had like a zombie and and skeleton
 

593
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,590
had like a zombie and and skeleton
grinder things but they only used that

594
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
grinder things but they only used that
 

595
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,230
grinder things but they only used that
for the items like they didn't

596
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
for the items like they didn't
 

597
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,629
for the items like they didn't
try to keep the the mobs alive in the

598
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
try to keep the the mobs alive in the
 

599
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,430
try to keep the the mobs alive in the
system they

600
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
system they
 

601
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,030
system they
killed them and

602
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
killed them and
 

603
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,750
killed them and
you know i found if you clear out an

604
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
you know i found if you clear out an
 

605
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,030
you know i found if you clear out an
eight by eight by

606
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
eight by eight by
 

607
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,550
eight by eight by
three area you would get lots of spiders

608
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
three area you would get lots of spiders
 

609
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,430
three area you would get lots of spiders
spawning very quickly and

610
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
spawning very quickly and
 

611
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,030
spawning very quickly and
and then i also came up with this

612
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
and then i also came up with this
 

613
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,430
and then i also came up with this
staircase system for the spiders it like

614
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
staircase system for the spiders it like
 

615
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,310
staircase system for the spiders it like
wraps

616
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
wraps
 

617
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,670
wraps
it it merges the two

618
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
it it merges the two
 

619
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,350
it it merges the two
spawning systems together and then they

620
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
spawning systems together and then they
 

621
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,509
spawning systems together and then they
go up the staircase

622
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
go up the staircase
 

623
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,750
go up the staircase
and they go over top this way

624
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
and they go over top this way
 

625
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,030
and they go over top this way
and then to the left and then they

626
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
and then to the left and then they
 

627
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,790
and then to the left and then they
fall here um

628
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
fall here um
 

629
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,870
fall here um
just the right distance for them to be a

630
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
just the right distance for them to be a
 

631
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,910
just the right distance for them to be a
one hit kill

632
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
one hit kill
 

633
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,990
one hit kill
or east or at least it used to be i

634
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
or east or at least it used to be i
 

635
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,710
or east or at least it used to be i
don't know why it's not working now

636
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
don't know why it's not working now
 

637
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,750
don't know why it's not working now
not even close to one hit kill

638
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
not even close to one hit kill
 

639
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,829
not even close to one hit kill
their targeting has changed a lot though

640
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
their targeting has changed a lot though
 

641
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,509
their targeting has changed a lot though
in time

642
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
in time
 

643
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,190
in time
and i think they get stuck in this thing

644
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
and i think they get stuck in this thing
 

645
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,990
and i think they get stuck in this thing
too now

646
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000

 

647
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,590

oh that noise it takes me back

648
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
oh that noise it takes me back
 

649
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,590
oh that noise it takes me back
uh it was a real challenge to set this

650
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
uh it was a real challenge to set this
 

651
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,949
uh it was a real challenge to set this
up where they wouldn't get

652
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
up where they wouldn't get
 

653
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,269
up where they wouldn't get
stuck or climb climb around in the thing

654
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
stuck or climb climb around in the thing
 

655
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,790
stuck or climb climb around in the thing
but obviously that doesn't work anymore

656
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
but obviously that doesn't work anymore
 

657
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,710
but obviously that doesn't work anymore
this piston at the top was to free them

658
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
this piston at the top was to free them
 

659
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,150
this piston at the top was to free them
if they got jammed

660
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160

 

661
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,350

uh-huh and i think this is a shutdown

662
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
uh-huh and i think this is a shutdown
 

663
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,269
uh-huh and i think this is a shutdown
yeah a force shutdown

664
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
yeah a force shutdown
 

665
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,870
yeah a force shutdown
anyway this served me

666
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
anyway this served me
 

667
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,629
anyway this served me
very well for a long time it was a great

668
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
very well for a long time it was a great
 

669
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,550
very well for a long time it was a great
source of experience and i have tons of

670
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
source of experience and i have tons of
 

671
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,509
source of experience and i have tons of
wool

672
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
wool
 

673
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,829
wool
in my world from making it from the

674
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
in my world from making it from the
 

675
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,870
in my world from making it from the
string i got over time using this thing

676
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
string i got over time using this thing
 

677
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,430
string i got over time using this thing
and also around the time we were doing

678
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
and also around the time we were doing
 

679
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,069
and also around the time we were doing
this

680
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
this
 

681
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,949
this
i made my very first enchanting station

682
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
i made my very first enchanting station
 

683
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,150
i made my very first enchanting station
here

684
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
here
 

685
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,150
here
i automated it in the past you needed

686
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
i automated it in the past you needed
 

687
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,509
i automated it in the past you needed
30 bookcases around the enchanting table

688
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
30 bookcases around the enchanting table
 

689
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,870
30 bookcases around the enchanting table
to reach level 50. now it only goes up

690
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
to reach level 50. now it only goes up
 

691
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,310
to reach level 50. now it only goes up
to level 30

692
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
to level 30
 

693
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,870
to level 30
and i could control

694
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
and i could control
 

695
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,629
and i could control
the number of bookcases around it by

696
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
the number of bookcases around it by
 

697
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,310
the number of bookcases around it by
quarters basically with with these

698
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
quarters basically with with these
 

699
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,350
quarters basically with with these
levers

700
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
levers
 

701
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,069
levers
so if i wanted different numbers i could

702
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
so if i wanted different numbers i could
 

703
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,310
so if i wanted different numbers i could
change the combination

704
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
change the combination
 

705
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,910
change the combination
and there's a light above a light below

706
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
and there's a light above a light below
 

707
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,550
and there's a light above a light below
very cool at the time i didn't have a

708
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
very cool at the time i didn't have a
 

709
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,069
very cool at the time i didn't have a
theme for this place like i didn't have

710
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
theme for this place like i didn't have
 

711
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,509
theme for this place like i didn't have
all this wood around and

712
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
all this wood around and
 

713
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,829
all this wood around and
and and stuff so i i just made out of

714
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
and and stuff so i i just made out of
 

715
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,430
and and stuff so i i just made out of
sandstone because that's

716
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
sandstone because that's
 

717
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,790
sandstone because that's
a block type i really like and

718
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
a block type i really like and
 

719
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,790
a block type i really like and
so it feels a little out of place but i

720
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
so it feels a little out of place but i
 

721
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,389
so it feels a little out of place but i
think we should keep it that way

722
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
think we should keep it that way
 

723
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,590
think we should keep it that way
just because the way it originally was

724
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
just because the way it originally was
 

725
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,870
just because the way it originally was
and wire goes up to the pistons

726
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880

 

727
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,110

oh how the game has changed um

728
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120

 

729
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,389

let's see we got path this is a river i

730
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
let's see we got path this is a river i
 

731
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,310
let's see we got path this is a river i
made just for looks basically

732
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
made just for looks basically
 

733
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,069
made just for looks basically
i actually really like it um

734

00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
it has a nice uh curve to it and
 

737
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,670
it has a nice uh curve to it and
the way i made this water it's ice i

738
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
the way i made this water it's ice i
 

739
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,230
the way i made this water it's ice i
melted so it doesn't flow

740
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
melted so it doesn't flow
 

741
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,949
melted so it doesn't flow
unless it's updated yesterday actually i

742
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
unless it's updated yesterday actually i

was taving
 

745
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,870
was taving
around this area trying to light up some

746
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
around this area trying to light up some
 

747
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,269
around this area trying to light up some
of the few remaining dark spots

748
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
of the few remaining dark spots
 

749
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,189
of the few remaining dark spots
i had no idea there was a cave here it

750
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
i had no idea there was a cave here it
 

751
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,750
i had no idea there was a cave here it
just so happened a creeper exploded here

752
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
just so happened a creeper exploded here
 

753
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,990
just so happened a creeper exploded here
and there was like only one block thick

754
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
and there was like only one block thick
 

755
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,870
and there was like only one block thick
stone here

756
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
stone here
 

757
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,910
stone here
and it opened opened up the passage i

758
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
and it opened opened up the passage i
 

759
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,949
and it opened opened up the passage i
was like

760
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
was like
 

761
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,030
was like
hey that's my place over here so

762
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
hey that's my place over here so
 

763
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,230
hey that's my place over here so
we might expand into that cave there

764
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
we might expand into that cave there
 

765
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,590
we might expand into that cave there
pretty soon the river

766
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
pretty soon the river
 

767
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,790
pretty soon the river
just goes down here and that's about as

768
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
just goes down here and that's about as
 

769
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,670
just goes down here and that's about as
far as i got

770
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
far as i got
 

771
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,509
far as i got
i might expand further out this way in

772
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
i might expand further out this way in
 

773
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,069
i might expand further out this way in
the future

774
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
the future
 

775
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,269
the future
i have a feeling i'm gonna have to

776
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
i have a feeling i'm gonna have to
 

777
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,110
i have a feeling i'm gonna have to
really get moving because i could talk

778
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
really get moving because i could talk
 

779
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,509
really get moving because i could talk
for

780
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
for
 

781
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,189
for
hours probably on stuff around the world

782
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
hours probably on stuff around the world
 

783
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,829
hours probably on stuff around the world
uh this is my slime farm here it's a

784
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
uh this is my slime farm here it's a
 

785
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,230
uh this is my slime farm here it's a
just a basic elevator to move them up

786
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
just a basic elevator to move them up
 

787
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,829
just a basic elevator to move them up
and then they drop

788
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
and then they drop
 

789
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,230
and then they drop
over here they get separated by their

790
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
over here they get separated by their
 

791
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,870
over here they get separated by their
size

792
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
size
 

793
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,550
size
this is for the small the medium the

794
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
this is for the small the medium the
 

795
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,590
this is for the small the medium the
large

796
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600

 

797
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,470

if we go over here this is where

798
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
if we go over here this is where
 

799
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,509
if we go over here this is where
oh man why is my world lighting so bad

800
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519

 

801
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,710

something is going on

802
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720

 

803
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,949

250 entities that does seem like a lot

804
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
250 entities that does seem like a lot
 

805
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,269
250 entities that does seem like a lot
uh this is a slime spawning pad here

806
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
uh this is a slime spawning pad here
 

807
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,990
uh this is a slime spawning pad here
it's just

808
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
it's just
 

809
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,629
it's just
at level 40 like the highest it possibly

810
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
at level 40 like the highest it possibly
 

811
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,069
at level 40 like the highest it possibly
can be in the world

812
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
can be in the world
 

813
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,590
can be in the world
and then it brings the slimes up there

814
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
and then it brings the slimes up there
 

815
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,949
and then it brings the slimes up there
i did it that way because i thought it'd

816
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
i did it that way because i thought it'd
 

817
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,350
i did it that way because i thought it'd
be cool to like do something with the

818
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
be cool to like do something with the
 

819
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,350
be cool to like do something with the
big slimes

820
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
big slimes
 

821
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,870
big slimes
for fun and i set up a track

822
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
for fun and i set up a track
 

823
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,110
for fun and i set up a track
a minecart track thing that picks them

824
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
a minecart track thing that picks them
 

825
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,710
a minecart track thing that picks them
up

826
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
up
 

827
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,870
up
when they step on that pressure plate

828
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
when they step on that pressure plate
 

829
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,749
when they step on that pressure plate
which uh

830
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
which uh
 

831
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,310
which uh
continually seems to be breaking for

832
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
continually seems to be breaking for
 

833
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,509
continually seems to be breaking for
some reason

834
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
some reason
 

835
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,629
some reason
and then randomly it seems to fix itself

836
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
and then randomly it seems to fix itself
 

837
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,590
and then randomly it seems to fix itself
but if we go up here

838
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
but if we go up here
 

839
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,029
but if we go up here
yeah see carts get stuck very weirdly

840
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
yeah see carts get stuck very weirdly
 

841
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,669
yeah see carts get stuck very weirdly
sometimes i don't know why

842
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679

 

843
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,710

it goes back up carts come down they go

you come up here uh there's a
 

933
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,750
you come up here uh there's a
actually pretty complicated water system

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
actually pretty complicated water system
 

935
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,110
actually pretty complicated water system
uh below us here and

936
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120

uh below us here and
if you get a fishing rod you can go down

938
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
if you get a fishing rod you can go down
 

939
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,270
if you get a fishing rod you can go down
at the center of the ufo and hopefully

940
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
at the center of the ufo and hopefully
 

941
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,710
at the center of the ufo and hopefully
this still works

942
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
this still works
 

943
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,909

this water here
 

965
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,029
this water here
and then they would all

966
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039

 

967
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,110

to
this place here and drops them down i

972
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
this place here and drops them down i
 

973
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,789
this place here and drops them down i
guess that's not working anymore

974
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
guess that's not working anymore
 

975

our new friends um
the cow farm slash wheat farm here is

984
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
the cow farm slash wheat farm here is
 

985
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,590
the cow farm slash wheat farm here is
actually kind of interesting

986
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
actually kind of interesting
 

987
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,029
actually kind of interesting
i made this a long time ago and

988
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
i made this a long time ago and
 

989
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,350
i made this a long time ago and
at that time if you walked on tilled

990
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
at that time if you walked on tilled
 

991
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,950
at that time if you walked on tilled
soil like we talked about

992
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
soil like we talked about
 

993
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,230
soil like we talked about
it would become untilled um but there

994
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
it would become untilled um but there
 

995
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,390
it would become untilled um but there
was a trick you could do in the game for

996
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
was a trick you could do in the game for
 

997
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,470
was a trick you could do in the game for
a very brief amount of time

998
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
a very brief amount of time
 

999
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,029
a very brief amount of time
where if you put fences underneath the

1000
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
where if you put fences underneath the
 

1001
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,710
where if you put fences underneath the
tilled soil you could run

1002
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
tilled soil you could run
 

1003
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,630
tilled soil you could run
and jump on it and it would never get

1004
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
and jump on it and it would never get
 

1005
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,909
and jump on it and it would never get
trampled

1006
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
trampled
 

1007
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,430
trampled
so the whole farm is has fences

1008
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
so the whole farm is has fences
 

1009
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,950
so the whole farm is has fences
underneath it

1010
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
underneath it
 

1011
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,510
underneath it
but obviously that doesn't work anymore

1012
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
but obviously that doesn't work anymore
 

1013

uh it harvests all the wheat falls down

1042
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
uh it harvests all the wheat falls down
 

1043
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,470
uh it harvests all the wheat falls down
the center

1044

these guys they don't fall down though

1046

these guys they don't fall down though
 

1047
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,230
these guys they don't fall down though
because of the iron bars although now if

1048
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
because of the iron bars although now if
 

1049
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,070
because of the iron bars although now if
you breed them they can fall down

1050
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
you breed them they can fall down
 

1051
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,830
you breed them they can fall down
and then they end up where they don't

1052
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
and then they end up where they don't
 

1053
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,630
and then they end up where they don't
belong

1054
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
belong
 

1055
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,750

1057
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,149

and you're ready to replant

1058
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159

 

1059
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,390

and we have our tail pixel art over

1060
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
and we have our tail pixel art over
 

1061
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,430
and we have our tail pixel art over
there

1062
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
there
 

1063
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,310
there
and our world map there which i'm still

1064
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
and our world map there which i'm still
 

1065
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,830
and our world map there which i'm still
trying to fill out

1066

trying to fill out
 

1067
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,270
trying to fill out
that's actually really tough to do

1068
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
that's actually really tough to do
 

1069
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,430
that's actually really tough to do
because uh the maps they don't have

1070
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
because uh the maps they don't have
 

1071
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,710
because uh the maps they don't have
coordinates on them so

1072
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
coordinates on them so
 

1073
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,029
coordinates on them so
to line them up side by side is a bit

1074
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
to line them up side by side is a bit
 

1075
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,310
to line them up side by side is a bit
challenging you have to do it by

1076
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
challenging you have to do it by
 

1077
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,909
challenging you have to do it by
sight and sometimes two different areas

1078
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919

1079
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,350
sight and sometimes two different areas
look like they belong

1080
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
look like they belong
 

1081
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,789
look like they belong
side by side uh we have our tools over

1082
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799

feeling cave
 

1285
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,110
feeling cave
but i realized very quickly that's not

1286
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
but i realized very quickly that's not
 

1287
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,669
but i realized very quickly that's not
actually

1288

1289
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,870

very doable in a cave unless you hollow

1290
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
very doable in a cave unless you hollow
 

1291
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,430

a
really really really big space because

1294

really really really big space because
 

1295
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,789
really really really big space because
i feel these are pretty small houses to

1296
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
i feel these are pretty small houses to
 

1297
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,029
i feel these are pretty small houses to
be honest and they take up a ton of

1298
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
be honest and they take up a ton of
 

1299
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,630
be honest and they take up a ton of
space each one

1300
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
space each one
 

1301
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,950
space each one
so kind of my new plan is to instead of

1302
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
so kind of my new plan is to instead of
 

1303
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,230
so kind of my new plan is to instead of
building

1304
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
building
 

1305
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,789

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,870

not really build houses just build

1308
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
not really build houses just build
 

1309
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,990
not really build houses just build

little compartments
for the villagers that they can

1312
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
for the villagers that they can
 

1313
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,990
for the villagers that they can
retreat into in the cave here and have

1314
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
retreat into in the cave here and have
 

1315
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,669
retreat into in the cave here and have
them run around the cave this area

1316
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
them run around the cave this area
 

1317
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,470
them run around the cave this area
instead of

1318
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
instead of
 

1319
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,950
instead of
off on their own place here and maybe

1320
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
off on their own place here and maybe
 

1321
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,070
off on their own place here and maybe
get them to do stuff that way

1322
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
get them to do stuff that way
 

1323

new blocks that have come out

1524
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
new blocks that have come out
 

1525
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,789
new blocks that have come out
um and again a question that comes up

1526
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
um and again a question that comes up
 

1527
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,950
um and again a question that comes up
often is do i use cheats or mcedit or

1528
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
often is do i use cheats or mcedit or
 

1529
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,230
often is do i use cheats or mcedit or
whatever

1530

um this is for ender pearls but that's

1550
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
um this is for ender pearls but that's
 

1551
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,070

um then we have the pop-up sheep farm

1554
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
um then we have the pop-up sheep farm
 

1555
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,389
um then we have the pop-up sheep farm
here this is actually one of my favorite

1556
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
here this is actually one of my favorite
 

1557
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,310
here this is actually one of my favorite
things i've built

it's probably not working anymore but we

1560
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
it's probably not working anymore but we
 

1561
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,230
it's probably not working anymore but we
can try it out

1562
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,240
can try it out
 

1563
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,110
can try it out
and this room goes along with it

1564
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120

 

1565
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,190

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
area around the sheet but now it like
 

1573
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,350
area around the sheet but now it like
jumps way farther out which

1574
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
jumps way farther out which
 

1575
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,310
jumps way farther out which
sort of messes up the whole thing this

1576
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
sort of messes up the whole thing this
 

1577
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,110
sort of messes up the whole thing this
thing was

1578
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
thing was
 

1579
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,630
thing was
really like amazing combination of

1580
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
really like amazing combination of
 

1581
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,750
really like amazing combination of

item mechanics and all kinds of stuff
work together really cool together

1586
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
work together really cool together
 

1587
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,789
work together really cool together
but since it involves so many

1588
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
but since it involves so many
 

1589
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,269
but since it involves so many
things that rely on physics of course

1590
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
things that rely on physics of course
 

1591

things that rely on physics of course
those change with the game

1592
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
those change with the game
 

1593
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,310
those change with the game
quite often and so a lot of the features

1594
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
quite often and so a lot of the features
 

1595
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,830
quite often and so a lot of the features
with this farm i don't think are really

1596
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
with this farm i don't think are really
 

1597
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,430
with this farm i don't think are really
working anymore

1598
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,440
working anymore
 

1599
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,470
working anymore
we have a manual resets

1600
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
we have a manual resets

drops the sheep down light turns off

1602
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200

 

1603
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,110

there's a master master manual reset

1604
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,120
there's a master master manual reset
 

1605
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,630
there's a master master manual reset
for all of them

1606
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640

 

1607
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,669

they all go down and then there was also

1608
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
they all go down and then there was also
 

1609
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,950
they all go down and then there was also
a water reset

1610
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
a water reset
 

1611
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,750
a water reset
that causes water to fall from the

1612
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:23,760
that causes water to fall from the
 

1613
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,110
that causes water to fall from the
ceiling and if

there was wool within

1616
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:28,640
there was wool within
 

1617
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,029
there was wool within
the area it would fall down these grates

1618
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
the area it would fall down these grates
 

1619
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,830
the area it would fall down these grates
here

1620
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
here
 

1621
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,950
here
and uh reset for

1622
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
and uh reset for
 

1623
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,389
and uh reset for
only the ones where wool was on the

1624
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
only the ones where wool was on the
 

1625
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,830
only the ones where wool was on the
ground and also the wool would get

1626
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
ground and also the wool would get
 

1627
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,950
ground and also the wool would get
collected

1628
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
collected
 

1629
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,509
collected
and it gets sent to this thing here to

1630
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
and it gets sent to this thing here to
 

1631
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,990
and it gets sent to this thing here to
this room

1632
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000

 

1633
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,509

kind of like this it's uh but since the

1634
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
kind of like this it's uh but since the
 

1635
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,230
kind of like this it's uh but since the
wall go

1636
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
wall go
 

1637
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,230
wall go
like jumps out further than it used to

1638
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
like jumps out further than it used to
 

1639
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,190
like jumps out further than it used to
it doesn't really

1640
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
it doesn't really
 

1641
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,789
it doesn't really
wash back into the grates properly

1642
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
wash back into the grates properly
 

1643
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,310
wash back into the grates properly
and if we go down

1644
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320

 

1645
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,870

yeah this is the thing here so this is a

1646
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
yeah this is the thing here so this is a
 

1647
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,190
yeah this is the thing here so this is a
a soil block

1648
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
a soil block
 

1649
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,510
a soil block
when a grass grows to it or spreads to

1650
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520
when a grass grows to it or spreads to
 

1651
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,669
when a grass grows to it or spreads to
it it triggers one bud switch

1652
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
it it triggers one bud switch
 

1653
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,909
it it triggers one bud switch
and then when the sheep eats it it

1654
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
and then when the sheep eats it it
 

1655
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,230
and then when the sheep eats it it
triggers a secondary one so it's two

1656
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
triggers a secondary one so it's two
 

1657
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,310
triggers a secondary one so it's two
bud switches connected connected

1658
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
bud switches connected connected
 

1659
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,669
bud switches connected connected
together

1660
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
together
 

1661
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,710
together
and then that makes a piston push the

1662
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
and then that makes a piston push the
 

1663
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,750
and then that makes a piston push the
sheep up

1664
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
sheep up
 

1665
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,149
sheep up
since it's in a piston it doesn't

1666
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
since it's in a piston it doesn't
 

1667
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,669
since it's in a piston it doesn't
suffocate because it doesn't count as a

1668
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:27,679
suffocate because it doesn't count as a
 

1669
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,430
suffocate because it doesn't count as a
full block

1670
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
full block
 

1671
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,710
full block
and i'm not

1672
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
and i'm not
 

1673
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,270
and i'm not
sure if sheep eating grass will cause a

1674
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,280
sure if sheep eating grass will cause a
 

1675
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,950
sure if sheep eating grass will cause a
block update anymore

1676
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,960

 

1677
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,629

it doesn't look like it i saw that in

1678
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
it doesn't look like it i saw that in
 

1679
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,190
it doesn't look like it i saw that in
the patch notes so this farm

1680
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
the patch notes so this farm

we are going to try out the fireworks
 

2031
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,589
we are going to try out the fireworks
today

2032
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599

2035
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,270
i recently redid them i'm curious to see
if it works i never did try

2036
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
if it works i never did try
 

2037
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,990
if it works i never did try
uh this is for the redstone controlling

2038
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
uh this is for the redstone controlling
 

2039
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,870
uh this is for the redstone controlling
it all

2040
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
it all
 

2041
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,950
it all
what i did is i got rid of all the fire

2042
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:16,960
what i did is i got rid of all the fire
 

2043
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,030
what i did is i got rid of all the fire
randomizers

2044
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,040
randomizers
 

2045
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,910
randomizers
and instead i didn't put a comparator

2046
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
and instead i didn't put a comparator
 

2047
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,750
and instead i didn't put a comparator
here though

2048
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760

 

2049
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,109

darn it i will be right back i want to

2050
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
darn it i will be right back i want to
 

2051
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,230
darn it i will be right back i want to
try this

2052
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240

 

2053
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,470

okay i think i fixed this now this is

2054
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
okay i think i fixed this now this is
 

2055
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,349
okay i think i fixed this now this is
like

2056
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
like
 

2057
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,990
like
the best randomizer in the game at the

2058
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
the best randomizer in the game at the
 

2059
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,950
the best randomizer in the game at the
moment

2060
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
moment
 

2061
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,030
moment
it said all it is is a dropper facing up

2062
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
it said all it is is a dropper facing up
 

2063
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,430
it said all it is is a dropper facing up
and it goes to a hopper item goes in the

2064
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:45,440
and it goes to a hopper item goes in the
 

2065
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,030
and it goes to a hopper item goes in the
hopper and then back down pretty much

2066
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
hopper and then back down pretty much
 

2067
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,390
hopper and then back down pretty much
instantly but it does

2068
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,400
instantly but it does
 

2069
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,550
instantly but it does
trigger this comparator and

2070
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560
trigger this comparator and
 

2071
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,150
trigger this comparator and
these eight items here they stack

2072
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
these eight items here they stack
 

2073
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,829
these eight items here they stack
into 64. but the sword does not so it

2074
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
into 64. but the sword does not so it
 

2075
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,150
into 64. but the sword does not so it
counts as like a full stack

2076
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
counts as like a full stack
 

2077
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,190
counts as like a full stack
and if you send it a pulse and it

2078
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
and if you send it a pulse and it
 

2079
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,670
and if you send it a pulse and it
goes to any of these eight items the

2080
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680
goes to any of these eight items the
 

2081
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,630
goes to any of these eight items the
pulse only

2082
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
pulse only
 

2083
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,030
pulse only
or the signal only goes one block but if

2084
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
or the signal only goes one block but if
 

2085
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,790
or the signal only goes one block but if
it chooses the sword

2086
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
it chooses the sword
 

2087
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,030
it chooses the sword
it will travel three blocks and it will

2088
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
it will travel three blocks and it will
 

2089
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,630
it will travel three blocks and it will
actually trigger

2090
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:16,640
actually trigger
 

2091
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,390
actually trigger
the dispenser above which has the

2092
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
the dispenser above which has the
 

2093
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,150
the dispenser above which has the
fireworks in

2094
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
fireworks in
 

2095
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,870
fireworks in
um so it's like a one in nine chance

2096
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
um so it's like a one in nine chance
 

2097
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,829
um so it's like a one in nine chance
with this setup

2098
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
with this setup
 

2099
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,349
with this setup
of course you can take items out if you

2100
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
of course you can take items out if you
 

2101
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,670
of course you can take items out if you
want it to be like one and eight or

2102
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
want it to be like one and eight or
 

2103
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,790
want it to be like one and eight or
one and seven or 50 50 whatever you want

2104
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
one and seven or 50 50 whatever you want
 

2105
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,150
one and seven or 50 50 whatever you want
or you can

2106
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
or you can
 

2107
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,790
or you can
combine two of these together and and

2108
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800
combine two of these together and and
 

2109
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,670
combine two of these together and and
make it

2110
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:35,680
make it
 

2111
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,710
make it
even less odds so

2112
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
even less odds so
 

2113
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,750
even less odds so
pretty cool um

2114
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:41,760
pretty cool um
 

2115
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,990
pretty cool um
we'll try this out at the end that was

2116
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
we'll try this out at the end that was
 

2117
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,109
we'll try this out at the end that was
at the end of the episode though because

2118
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
at the end of the episode though because
 

2119
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,750
at the end of the episode though because
it's daytime now so we'll keep moving

2120
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:51,760
it's daytime now so we'll keep moving
 

2121
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,750
it's daytime now so we'll keep moving
keep on moving we'll come back to this

2122
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
keep on moving we'll come back to this
 

2123
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,750
keep on moving we'll come back to this
later

2124
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
later
 

2125
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,309
later
let's go i really don't think we're

00:43:58,309 --> 00:43:58,319
let's go i really don't think we're
 

2127
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,270
let's go i really don't think we're
going to be able to see

2128
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
going to be able to see
 

2129
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,710
going to be able to see
everything today oh man i totally forgot

2130
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
everything today oh man i totally forgot

this is my
 

2137
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,109
this is my
my detector thing when we when we cross

2138
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
my detector thing when we when we cross
 

2139
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,390
my detector thing when we when we cross
a line it can tell if we

2140
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
a line it can tell if we
 

2141
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,550
a line it can tell if we
or it can tell when we cross the line

2142
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
or it can tell when we cross the line
 

2143
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,390
or it can tell when we cross the line
that's what i'm trying to say

2144
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400

 

2145
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,990

what is dude that looks really weird
 

2147
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,349
what is dude that looks really weird
when it's not rendered

2148
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359

 

2149
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,190

i thought i had a floating like piston

2150
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
i thought i had a floating like piston
 

2151
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,670
i thought i had a floating like piston
door there for some reason

2152
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
door there for some reason
 

2153
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,510
door there for some reason
oh look at all the villagers all in one

2154
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
oh look at all the villagers all in one
 

2155
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,710
oh look at all the villagers all in one
house

2156
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
house
 

2157
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,349
house
this is the first village i found in my

2158
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
this is the first village i found in my
 

2159
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,230
this is the first village i found in my
world

2160
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240
world
 

2161
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,510
world
i totally i totally cleared it of all

2162
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
i totally i totally cleared it of all
 

2163
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,030
i totally i totally cleared it of all
villagers and i brought them back to the

2164
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,040
villagers and i brought them back to the
 

2165
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,750
villagers and i brought them back to the
cave and i think it

2166
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
cave and i think it
 

2167
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,670
cave and i think it
yeah i brought all the villagers back

2168
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
yeah i brought all the villagers back
 

2169
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,670
yeah i brought all the villagers back
actually so it was totally empty and

2170
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
actually so it was totally empty and
 

2171
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,430
actually so it was totally empty and
then i decided to restore it at one

2172
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
then i decided to restore it at one
 

2173
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,309
then i decided to restore it at one
point

2174
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319
point
 

2175
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,349
point
and upgrade it so i put a fence around

2176
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
and upgrade it so i put a fence around
 

2177
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:55,910
and upgrade it so i put a fence around
it

2178
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
it

2517
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,950
were
like always at the main island there

2518
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
like always at the main island there
 

2519
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,109
like always at the main island there
people were not building out in the void

2520
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
people were not building out in the void
 

2521
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,829
people were not building out in the void
so this was a big

2522
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
so this was a big
 

2523
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,670
so this was a big
change with the way people made enderman

2524
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
change with the way people made enderman
 

2525
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,349
change with the way people made enderman
farms

2526
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
farms
 

2527
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,230
farms
and people weren't really making

2528
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,240
and people weren't really making
 

2529
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,150
and people weren't really making
enderman farms for experience before

2530
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
enderman farms for experience before
 

2531
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,630
enderman farms for experience before
they were

2532
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
they were
 

2533
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,790
they were
mostly doing it for ender pearls but

2534
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
mostly doing it for ender pearls but
 

2535
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,750
mostly doing it for ender pearls but
when i built this to my surprise it was

2536
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:25,760
when i built this to my surprise it was
 

2537
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,150
when i built this to my surprise it was
a really

2538
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
a really
 

2539
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,270
a really
good experience farm

2540
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
good experience farm
 

2541
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,829
good experience farm
um and then people kind of took this

2542
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
um and then people kind of took this
 

2543
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:34,470
um and then people kind of took this
idea and

2544
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
idea and
 

2545
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,670
idea and
made it a lot better like panda he uh

2546
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
made it a lot better like panda he uh
 

2547
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,750
made it a lot better like panda he uh
he discovered that trick with the vines

2548
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760
he discovered that trick with the vines
 

2549
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,349
he discovered that trick with the vines
that allowed you to stack

2550
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:41,359
that allowed you to stack
 

2551
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,790
that allowed you to stack
spawning platforms together in the end

2552
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800
spawning platforms together in the end
 

2553
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,309
spawning platforms together in the end
oh he's still mad let's go back let's go

2554
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
oh he's still mad let's go back let's go
 

2555
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,470
oh he's still mad let's go back let's go
back

2556
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
back
 

2557
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,390
back
uh but basically they get dropped down

2558
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
uh but basically they get dropped down
 

2559
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,670
uh but basically they get dropped down
to one hit kill

2560
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:53,680
to one hit kill
 

2561
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,950
to one hit kill
from our ender ender up there it's a

2562
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
from our ender ender up there it's a
 

2563
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,470
from our ender ender up there it's a
whole bunch of pistons

2564
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
whole bunch of pistons
 

2565
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,109
whole bunch of pistons
and pressure plates when they spawn on

2566
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
and pressure plates when they spawn on
 

2567
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,710
and pressure plates when they spawn on
the pressure plates get pushed down

2568
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
the pressure plates get pushed down
 

2569
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,750
the pressure plates get pushed down
and they fall like 40

2570
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,760
and they fall like 40
 

2571
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,790
and they fall like 40
43 blocks i think it is on to our

2572
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
43 blocks i think it is on to our
 

2573
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,309
43 blocks i think it is on to our
platform here

2574
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
platform here
 

2575
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,150
platform here
you look at them they all cluster to one

2576
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
you look at them they all cluster to one
 

2577
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,349
you look at them they all cluster to one
point and you kill them

2578
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:17,359

 

2579
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,270

all right i brought us back here we're

2580
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
all right i brought us back here we're
 

2581
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,670
all right i brought us back here we're
gonna go to one last place before we end

2582
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
gonna go to one last place before we end
 

2583
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:21,990
gonna go to one last place before we end
this

2584
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
this
 

2585
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,230
this
again i'm sorry but we don't have time

2586
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
again i'm sorry but we don't have time
 

2587
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,750
again i'm sorry but we don't have time
to see quite everything

2588
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
to see quite everything
 

2589
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,030
to see quite everything
this episode but i feel we did uh

2590
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
this episode but i feel we did uh
 

2591
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,309
this episode but i feel we did uh
pretty good with the amount of time we

2592
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:30,319
pretty good with the amount of time we
 

2593
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,510
pretty good with the amount of time we
had or that we used

2594
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
had or that we used
 

2595
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,710
had or that we used
uh this is another hub

2596
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
uh this is another hub
 

2597
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,950
uh this is another hub
it's going gonna be the main branch

2598
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
it's going gonna be the main branch
 

2599
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,630
it's going gonna be the main branch
branch off to different areas

2600
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
branch off to different areas
 

2601
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,390
branch off to different areas
for quick travel in my world

2602
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
for quick travel in my world
 

2603
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,270
for quick travel in my world
uh which is sort of set up sort of not

2604
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
uh which is sort of set up sort of not
 

2605
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,349
uh which is sort of set up sort of not
supposed to be a selector panel for

2606
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
supposed to be a selector panel for
 

2607
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,349
supposed to be a selector panel for
choosing different destinations

2608
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359

 

2609
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,349

and if we run through the tunnel here

2610
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
and if we run through the tunnel here
 

2611
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,870
and if we run through the tunnel here
we will eventually get to

2612
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
we will eventually get to
 

2613
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,069
we will eventually get to
the dual blaze farm which is

2614
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
the dual blaze farm which is
 

2615
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,430
the dual blaze farm which is
what i usually use when i want

2616
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
what i usually use when i want
 

2617
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,589
what i usually use when i want
experience in my world

2618
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:11,599

 

2619
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,829

there is another fortress up over here

2620
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
there is another fortress up over here
 

2621
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,030
there is another fortress up over here
i got really lucky with this one too as

2622
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
i got really lucky with this one too as
 

2623
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,309
i got really lucky with this one too as
i found this is like the second fortress

2624
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
i found this is like the second fortress
 

2625
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,829
i found this is like the second fortress
i explored in this world and it just

2626
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
i explored in this world and it just
 

2627
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,750
i explored in this world and it just
happened to have a

2628
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
happened to have a
 

2629
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,829
happened to have a
dual blaze farm in it and they were

2630
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
dual blaze farm in it and they were
 

2631
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:33,270
dual blaze farm in it and they were
positioned really nicely from each other

2632
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280

 

2633
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,789

and it all worked out pretty good

2634
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:36,799
and it all worked out pretty good
 

2635
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,030
and it all worked out pretty good
granted this took me a long time to

2636
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
granted this took me a long time to
 

2637
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,630
granted this took me a long time to
build

2638
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
build
 

2639
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,109
build
because i went through so many uh

2640
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
because i went through so many uh
 

2641
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,030
because i went through so many uh
so many tests and stuff with it why are

2642
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
so many tests and stuff with it why are
 

2643
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,030
so many tests and stuff with it why are
they free

2644
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040

 

2645
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,069

why is he free he must have spawned in

2646
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
why is he free he must have spawned in
 

2647
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,349
why is he free he must have spawned in
the fortress and

2648
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:55,359
the fortress and
 

2649
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,829
the fortress and
this is wandering around i'm guessing

2650
00:55:59,829 --> 00:55:59,839

 

2651
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,750

so it's pretty loud i got it all on a

2652
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
so it's pretty loud i got it all on a
 

2653
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,549
so it's pretty loud i got it all on a
clock

2654
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559

 

2655
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,190

which activates that conveyor belt there

2656
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
which activates that conveyor belt there
 

2657
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,109
which activates that conveyor belt there
which brings them all to one central

2658
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
which brings them all to one central
 

2659
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,870
which brings them all to one central
point

2660
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
point
 

2661
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,390
point
they spawn here and here

2662
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
they spawn here and here
 

2663
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,950
they spawn here and here
they go down this like funnel thing that

2664
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,960
they go down this like funnel thing that
 

2665
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,390
they go down this like funnel thing that
put that

2666
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
put that
 

2667
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,150
put that
moves them all into one main spot

2668
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160

 

2669
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,829

and then at the at the bottom of the

2670
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:25,839
and then at the at the bottom of the
 

2671
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,430
and then at the at the bottom of the
funnel there is where they connect to

2672
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
funnel there is where they connect to
 

2673
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,349
funnel there is where they connect to
the conveyor belt

2674
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
the conveyor belt
 

2675
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,270
the conveyor belt
pushed to the lava which forces them to

2676
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
pushed to the lava which forces them to
 

2677
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,470
pushed to the lava which forces them to
swim up

2678
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:32,480
swim up
 

2679
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,829
swim up
to this killing chamber here

2680
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:35,839
to this killing chamber here
 

2681
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,109
to this killing chamber here
you open the gates

2682
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119

 

2683
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,030

lets them up they swim up to the very
