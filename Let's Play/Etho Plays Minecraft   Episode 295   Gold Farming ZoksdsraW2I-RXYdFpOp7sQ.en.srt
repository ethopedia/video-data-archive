00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
how would you explore 2000 by 2000
 

239

how would you explore 2000 by 2000
nether

240
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
nether
 

241
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,629
nether
that is a lot of space by the way i was

242
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
that is a lot of space by the way i was
 

243
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,830
that is a lot of space by the way i was
i didn't think it was going to take me a

248
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
man over an hour like two hours
 

249
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,670
man over an hour like two hours
with speed potions so the way i

250
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
with speed potions so the way i
 

251
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,749
with speed potions so the way i
did it i thought hey

00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
did it i thought hey
 

253
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,310
did it i thought hey
don't i just go to the top of the nether

254
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
don't i just go to the top of the nether
 

255
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,590
don't i just go to the top of the nether
and

256
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
and
 

257
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,830
and
we got a nice perfect flat ground to

258
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
we got a nice perfect flat ground to
 

259
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,350
we got a nice perfect flat ground to
walk on

260
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
walk on
 

261
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,629
walk on
and i just ran and i ran in total i had

262
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
and i just ran and i ran in total i had
 

263
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,390
and i just ran and i ran in total i had
to walk like twenty thousand blocks to

264
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
to walk like twenty thousand blocks to
 

265
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,790
to walk like twenty thousand blocks to
load the 2000 by 2000

266
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
load the 2000 by 2000
 

267
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,990
load the 2000 by 2000
so it's it's a ton of uh kind of running

268
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
so it's it's a ton of uh kind of running
 

269
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,790
so it's it's a ton of uh kind of running
around

270
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
around
 

271
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,749
around
and basically basically the way i did it

272
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
and basically basically the way i did it
 

273
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,550
and basically basically the way i did it
i

274
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
i
 

275
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,749
i
i did a perfect uh perimeter around

276
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
i did a perfect uh perimeter around
 

277
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,270
i did a perfect uh perimeter around
the nether here i um

278
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
the nether here i um
 

279
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,390
the nether here i um
first of all i went to zero on x

280
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
first of all i went to zero on x
 

281
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,670
first of all i went to zero on x
and z then i went like uh

282
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
and z then i went like uh
 

283
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,189
and z then i went like uh
every 250 blocks i would run a line

284
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
every 250 blocks i would run a line
 

285
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,950
every 250 blocks i would run a line
from negative 1000 to one thousand zed

286
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
from negative 1000 to one thousand zed
 

287
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,270
from negative 1000 to one thousand zed
and then i'd move over 250 more blocks

288
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
and then i'd move over 250 more blocks
 

289
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,870
and then i'd move over 250 more blocks
on x and

290
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
on x and
 

291
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,110
on x and
run another 2 000 blocks and then 250

292
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
run another 2 000 blocks and then 250
 

293
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,029
run another 2 000 blocks and then 250
more 2000 more

294
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
more 2000 more
 

295
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,710
more 2000 more
and just did like a grid pattern

296
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
and just did like a grid pattern
 

297
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,430
and just did like a grid pattern
and i would stop at a thousand for each

298
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
and i would stop at a thousand for each
 

299
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,950
and i would stop at a thousand for each
of them so

300
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
of them so
 

301
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,150
of them so
my nether should be safe from

302
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
my nether should be safe from
 

303
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,749
my nether should be safe from
upgrading to the snapshot we're going to

304
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
upgrading to the snapshot we're going to
 

305
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,189
upgrading to the snapshot we're going to
check it out though in just a sec i'm

306
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
check it out though in just a sec i'm

check it out though in just a sec i'm
going to try to find

308
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
going to try to find
 

309
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,590
going to try to find
a fortress and see if we can get wither

310
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
a fortress and see if we can get wither
 

311
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,270
a fortress and see if we can get wither
skeletons spawning in that

312
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
skeletons spawning in that
 

313
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,430
skeletons spawning in that
and if they do then i'm going to upgrade

314
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
and if they do then i'm going to upgrade
 

315
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,309
and if they do then i'm going to upgrade
and then we'll see if

316
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
and then we'll see if
 

317
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,110
and then we'll see if
we still have them spawning and if not i

318
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
we still have them spawning and if not i
 

319
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,790
we still have them spawning and if not i

all right anyway uh let's go find a
 

355
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,710
all right anyway uh let's go find a
fortress

356
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720

 

357
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,309

okay so i think we're gonna use this

358
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
okay so i think we're gonna use this
 

359
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,990
okay so i think we're gonna use this
fortress here this is the very first

360
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
fortress here this is the very first
 

361
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,869
fortress here this is the very first
fortress i

362
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
fortress i
 

363
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,070
fortress i
visited in my world

364
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
visited in my world
 

365
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,629
visited in my world
and good news we got skeletons with our

366
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
and good news we got skeletons with our
 

367
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,230
and good news we got skeletons with our
skeletons even

368
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
skeletons even
 

369
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,710
skeletons even
so this is definitely spawning fortress

370
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
so this is definitely spawning fortress
 

371
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,469
so this is definitely spawning fortress
mobs we're looking for either

372
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479

 

373
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,230

the skeleton guys or magma cubes or

374
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
the skeleton guys or magma cubes or
 

375
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,749
the skeleton guys or magma cubes or
blazes

376
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
blazes
 

377
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,309
blazes
but this is 1.64 so there's no surprise

378
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
but this is 1.64 so there's no surprise
 

379
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,749
but this is 1.64 so there's no surprise
they're spawning still

380
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
they're spawning still
 

381
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,270
they're spawning still

room here to see if something spawns

388
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
room here to see if something spawns
 

389
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,909
room here to see if something spawns
got a magma cube back there i'm going to

390
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
got a magma cube back there i'm going to
 

391

can tell already like uh
 

423
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,310
can tell already like uh
new rendering code came out with this

424
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
new rendering code came out with this
 

425
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,269
new rendering code came out with this
there's mint mapping now and a few other

426
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
there's mint mapping now and a few other
 

427
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,110
there's mint mapping now and a few other
um interesting interesting things

428
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
um interesting interesting things
 

429
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,110
um interesting interesting things
there's oh how do you say anastropic

430
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
there's oh how do you say anastropic
 

431
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,070
there's oh how do you say anastropic
filtering and you can change your render

432
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
filtering and you can change your render
 

433
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,030
filtering and you can change your render
distance to

434
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
distance to
 

435
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,389
distance to
more than it used to be let's try 16. i

436
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
more than it used to be let's try 16. i
 

437
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,590
more than it used to be let's try 16. i
can tell though it's like

438
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
can tell though it's like
 

439
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,310
can tell though it's like
darker in the background it seems um

440
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
darker in the background it seems um
 

441
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,990
darker in the background it seems um
but overall the new rendering is

442
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
but overall the new rendering is
 

443
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,190
but overall the new rendering is
actually pretty good

444
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200

 

445
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,230

i find stuff looks a lot smoother and

446
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
i find stuff looks a lot smoother and
 

447
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,350
i find stuff looks a lot smoother and
also i think colors are more vibrant

448
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
also i think colors are more vibrant
 

449
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,030
also i think colors are more vibrant
with it

450
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
with it
 

451
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,110
with it
um but some stuff in the background

452
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
um but some stuff in the background
 

453
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,509
um but some stuff in the background
looks a little messed up

454
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
looks a little messed up
 

455
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,190
looks a little messed up
uh this is this is going to be

456
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
uh this is this is going to be
 

457
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,630
uh this is this is going to be
interesting though because i

458
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
interesting though because i
 

459
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,269
interesting though because i
i did use the 1.7 snapshot for a while

460
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
i did use the 1.7 snapshot for a while
 

461
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,870
i did use the 1.7 snapshot for a while
and i think

462
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
and i think
 

463
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,910
and i think
just the way that all worked out i might

464
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
just the way that all worked out i might
 

465
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,069
just the way that all worked out i might
have

466
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
have
 

467
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,110
have
oh good there's please i

468
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
oh good there's please i
 

469
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,110
oh good there's please i
i thought i might have went to the

470
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
i thought i might have went to the
 

471
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,030
i thought i might have went to the
nether jeering

472
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
nether jeering
 

473
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,150
nether jeering
use of it and somehow saved that in

474
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
use of it and somehow saved that in
 

475
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,910
use of it and somehow saved that in
with my world and i thought i was gonna

476
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
with my world and i thought i was gonna
 

477
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,509
with my world and i thought i was gonna
mess things up maybe

478
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
mess things up maybe
 

479
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,790
mess things up maybe
for this close fortress anyway uh the

480
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
for this close fortress anyway uh the
 

481
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,269
for this close fortress anyway uh the
reason

482
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
reason
 

483
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,190
reason
why you have to go and explore

484
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
why you have to go and explore
 

485
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,190
why you have to go and explore
everything again is because

486
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
everything again is because
 

487
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,829
everything again is because
uh fortresses and like which farms and

488
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
uh fortresses and like which farms and
 

489
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,430
uh fortresses and like which farms and
that kind of stuff

490
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
that kind of stuff
 

491
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,150
that kind of stuff
was determined by the seed

492
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160

 

493
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,509

and that since they updated terrain

494
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
and that since they updated terrain
 

495
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,230
and that since they updated terrain
generation

496
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240

 

497
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,670

structures were appearing in different

498
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
structures were appearing in different
 

499
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,509
structures were appearing in different
places with the new generation

500
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
places with the new generation
 

501
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,430
places with the new generation
so um which farm might not be where it

502
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
so um which farm might not be where it
 

503
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,269
so um which farm might not be where it
was before it might be in a new place

504
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
was before it might be in a new place
 

505
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,350
was before it might be in a new place
that you don't know so they fixed that

506
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
that you don't know so they fixed that
 

507
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,670
that you don't know so they fixed that
or created a fix for it by actually

508
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
or created a fix for it by actually
 

509
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,990
or created a fix for it by actually
saving it to file

510
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
saving it to file
 

511
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,630
saving it to file
and by going to that area it saves it to

512
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
and by going to that area it saves it to
 

513
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,910
and by going to that area it saves it to
file

514
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
file
 

515
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,350
file
so that when you update then it it's got

516
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
so that when you update then it it's got
 

517
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,790
so that when you update then it it's got
information that that's where it's

518
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
information that that's where it's
 

519
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,310
information that that's where it's
supposed to be instead of

520
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
supposed to be instead of
 

521
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,630
supposed to be instead of
where it figures it out when it

522
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
where it figures it out when it
 

523
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,230
where it figures it out when it
generates the seed i gotta figure out

524
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
generates the seed i gotta figure out
 

525
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,110
generates the seed i gotta figure out
how to get back here now

526
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
how to get back here now
 

527
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,430
how to get back here now
anyway we are in the snapshots

528
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
anyway we are in the snapshots
 

529
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,030
anyway we are in the snapshots
i have a nice gas ball over there um

530
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
i have a nice gas ball over there um
 

531
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,190
i have a nice gas ball over there um
i think we're gonna get working on the

532
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
i think we're gonna get working on the
 

533
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,430
i think we're gonna get working on the
the gold farm though so i gotta go get a

534
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
the gold farm though so i gotta go get a
 

535
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,750
the gold farm though so i gotta go get a
bunch of materials together

536
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
bunch of materials together
 

537
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,310
bunch of materials together
and i might do a time lapse of it i'm

538
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
and i might do a time lapse of it i'm
 

539
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,590
and i might do a time lapse of it i'm
not sure

540
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
not sure
 

541
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,710
not sure
look at the tracks like uh there's a

542
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
look at the tracks like uh there's a
 

543
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,310
look at the tracks like uh there's a
line there you can see it

544
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
line there you can see it
 

545
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,509
line there you can see it
the ones further back are dark and

546
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
the ones further back are dark and
 

547
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,150
the ones further back are dark and
as you move that that darkness creeps

548
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
as you move that that darkness creeps
 

549
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,069
as you move that that darkness creeps
back

550
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079

 

551
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,710

um so yeah definitely some interesting

552
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
um so yeah definitely some interesting
 

553
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,670
um so yeah definitely some interesting

555
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,990

with the snapshot and of course there's

556
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
with the snapshot and of course there's
 

557
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,910
with the snapshot and of course there's
these

558
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
these
 

559
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,350
these
super secret settings which

560
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
super secret settings which
 

561
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,269
super secret settings which
change uh uh they change

562
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
change uh uh they change
 

563

filters and stuff which is

564
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
filters and stuff which is
 

565
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,629
filters and stuff which is
or not filters shaders this is a shaders

i think uh oh i never even noticed this

570
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
i think uh oh i never even noticed this
 

571
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,470
i think uh oh i never even noticed this
look at the

572
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
look at the
 

573
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,829
look at the
the hot bar the enchanted items that's

574
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
the hot bar the enchanted items that's
 

575
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,670
the hot bar the enchanted items that's
pretty wild

576
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
pretty wild
 

577
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,790
pretty wild
i think mojang are experimenting to see

578
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
i think mojang are experimenting to see
 

579
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,949
i think mojang are experimenting to see
if people have problems loading the

580
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
if people have problems loading the
 

581
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,470
if people have problems loading the
shaders and if it works out okay then

582
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
shaders and if it works out okay then
 

583
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,470
shaders and if it works out okay then
they'll probably

584
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
they'll probably
 

585
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,710
they'll probably
create some kind of support for them

586
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720

 

587
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,069

i could get used to this all right

588
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
i could get used to this all right
 

589
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,310
i could get used to this all right
i'll be right back this was really cool

590

actually this is the inverted uh
 

593
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,310
actually this is the inverted uh
was this inverted color shader so purple

594
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
was this inverted color shader so purple
 

595
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,430
was this inverted color shader so purple
becomes green and yellow becomes blue

596
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
becomes green and yellow becomes blue
 

597

could get some more
 

621
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,150
could get some more
if we if we made it that far today who

622
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
if we if we made it that far today who
 

623
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,230

knows how long this is going to take me

624
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
knows how long this is going to take me
 

625
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,990
knows how long this is going to take me
uh but we're going to try to as much as

626
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
uh but we're going to try to as much as
 

627
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,829

we can
 

629
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,550
we can
and this is 12 stacks of pistons that's

630
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
and this is 12 stacks of pistons that's
 

631
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,790
and this is 12 stacks of pistons that's
not quite enough but again

632
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
not quite enough but again
 

633
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,430
not quite enough but again
i got the iron if we get more redstone i

634
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
i got the iron if we get more redstone i
 

635
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,949
i got the iron if we get more redstone i
can make more pistons

636
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
can make more pistons
 

637
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,590
can make more pistons
if there's a shortage um so i'm going to

638
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
if there's a shortage um so i'm going to
 

639

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,829
the white dots but the map is not
rendering

676
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

677
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,389

679
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,870

oh that looks so much better

680
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880

 

681
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,030

yeah that gives me that gives me

682
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
yeah that gives me that gives me
 

683
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,269
yeah that gives me that gives me
encouragement i want to finish my uh

684
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
encouragement i want to finish my uh
 

685
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,030
encouragement i want to finish my uh
my mapping project now i wasn't too

686
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
my mapping project now i wasn't too
 

687
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,629
my mapping project now i wasn't too
excited about before because it didn't

688
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
excited about before because it didn't
 

689
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,990
excited about before because it didn't
look that great

690
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
look that great
 

691
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,509
look that great
but now that's awesome

692
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
but now that's awesome
 

693
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,150
but now that's awesome
and apparently i think they render

694
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
and apparently i think they render
 

695
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,710
and apparently i think they render
pretty good too like they're not too

696
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
pretty good too like they're not too
 

697
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,990
pretty good too like they're not too
processor intensive

698
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
processor intensive
 

699
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,030

oh that looks so much better

700
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040

 

701
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,629

oh i want to see the whole board done

702
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
oh i want to see the whole board done
 

703
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,910
oh i want to see the whole board done
now that is really cool

704
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
now that is really cool
 

705
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,629
now that is really cool
i like that okay so we'll have to get to

706
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
i like that okay so we'll have to get to
 

707
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,310
i like that okay so we'll have to get to
that sometime soon i'm liking the new

708
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
that sometime soon i'm liking the new
 

709
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,269

snapshot

710
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
snapshot
 

711
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,350
snapshot
i find it runs very smoothly too like

712
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
i find it runs very smoothly too like
 

713
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,949
i find it runs very smoothly too like
they made so many code

714
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
they made so many code
 

715
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,710
they made so many code
optima optimizations with the snapshot

716
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
optima optimizations with the snapshot
 

717
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,590
optima optimizations with the snapshot
and i can tell things are so smooth with

718
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
and i can tell things are so smooth with
 

719
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,230
and i can tell things are so smooth with
it

720
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
it
 

721
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,670
it
so if you guys have like frame rate

722
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
so if you guys have like frame rate
 

723
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,430
so if you guys have like frame rate
troubles when you update uh you'll

724
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
troubles when you update uh you'll
 

725
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,790
troubles when you update uh you'll
probably find the game runs a little

726
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
probably find the game runs a little
 

727
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,790
probably find the game runs a little
better for you

728
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
better for you
 

729
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,509
better for you
um but here i go

730
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
um but here i go
 

731
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,430
um but here i go
i don't know how long it's going to take

732
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
i don't know how long it's going to take
 

733
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,269
i don't know how long it's going to take
maybe i should do this in steps maybe i

734
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
maybe i should do this in steps maybe i
 

735
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,430
maybe i should do this in steps maybe i
should do all the pistons first and then

736
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
should do all the pistons first and then
 

737
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,230
should do all the pistons first and then
redstone then string i don't know how

i might have to build a wall if i'm

744
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
i might have to build a wall if i'm
 

745
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,629
i might have to build a wall if i'm
losing too much stuff

746
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
losing too much stuff
 

747
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,629
losing too much stuff
but we'll see um

748
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
but we'll see um
 

749
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,710
but we'll see um
and i don't know i kind of wanted to do

750
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
and i don't know i kind of wanted to do
 

751
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,990
and i don't know i kind of wanted to do
a time

752
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
a time
 

753
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,670
a time
time lapse of me building this but the

754
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
time lapse of me building this but the
 

755
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,269
time lapse of me building this but the
nether might be too dark

756
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
nether might be too dark
 

757
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,310
nether might be too dark
to really get much out of it like

758
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
to really get much out of it like
 

759
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,550
to really get much out of it like
if things are moving quick and it's dark

760
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
if things are moving quick and it's dark
 

761
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,430
if things are moving quick and it's dark
and gloomy

762
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
and gloomy
 

763
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,790
and gloomy
uh it's hard for your eyes to focus so

764
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
uh it's hard for your eyes to focus so
 

765
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,189
uh it's hard for your eyes to focus so
i might just skip it but we'll see we'll

766
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
i might just skip it but we'll see we'll
 

767
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,350
i might just skip it but we'll see we'll
see how this goes

768
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
see how this goes
 

769
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,790
see how this goes
um let's head on up

770
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800

 

771
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,550

i'm scared doing this now because i hit

772
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
i'm scared doing this now because i hit
 

773
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,150
i'm scared doing this now because i hit
a pigment before

774
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
a pigment before
 

775
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,990
a pigment before
uh but yeah this is the pattern i need

776
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
uh but yeah this is the pattern i need
 

777
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,590
uh but yeah this is the pattern i need
to copy we got

778
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
to copy we got
 

779
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,069
to copy we got
pistons running all along there's string

780
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
pistons running all along there's string
 

781
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,670
pistons running all along there's string
above those

782
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
above those
 

783
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,189
above those
there's redstone up here i think all the

784
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
there's redstone up here i think all the
 

785
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,870
there's redstone up here i think all the
blocks like the slabs are in place i

786
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
blocks like the slabs are in place i
 

787
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,550
blocks like the slabs are in place i
just have to put the other stuff

788
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
just have to put the other stuff
 

789
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,990
just have to put the other stuff
there so um

790
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
there so um
 

791
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,749
there so um
once i get into the groove of it it'll

792
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
once i get into the groove of it it'll
 

793
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,189
once i get into the groove of it it'll
probably go pretty quick maybe we'll

794
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
probably go pretty quick maybe we'll
 

795
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,030
probably go pretty quick maybe we'll
just try to

796
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
just try to
 

797
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,470
just try to
aside here oh this is good actually i

798
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
aside here oh this is good actually i
 

799
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,350
aside here oh this is good actually i
have this blocking in this place off of

800
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
have this blocking in this place off of
 

801
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,189
have this blocking in this place off of
and the speed 2 beacon is going to come

802
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
and the speed 2 beacon is going to come
 

803
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,230
and the speed 2 beacon is going to come
in handy for sure

804
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
in handy for sure
 

805
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,789
in handy for sure
because i can move quick while shifting

806
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
because i can move quick while shifting
 

807
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,549
because i can move quick while shifting
yeah i think the way to do this do the

808
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
yeah i think the way to do this do the
 

809
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,309
yeah i think the way to do this do the
pistons first

810
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
pistons first
 

811
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,789
pistons first
um then the redstone then the string

812
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
um then the redstone then the string
 

813
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,789
um then the redstone then the string
probably

814
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
probably
 

815
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,949
probably
and the trip wires because once once you

816
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
and the trip wires because once once you
 

817
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,909
and the trip wires because once once you
do this

818
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
do this
 

819
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,870
do this
where it pushes then it's it's going to

820
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
where it pushes then it's it's going to
 

821
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,630
where it pushes then it's it's going to
be tough

822
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
be tough
 

823
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,549
be tough
uh it's actually really quiet i'm on

824
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
uh it's actually really quiet i'm on
 

825
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,669
uh it's actually really quiet i'm on
hard yeah okay

826
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
hard yeah okay
 

827
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,190
hard yeah okay
cool so i will see you guys in a while

828
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
cool so i will see you guys in a while
 

829
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,710
cool so i will see you guys in a while
um until i get bored of this anyway

830
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
um until i get bored of this anyway
 

831
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,630
um until i get bored of this anyway
i'll either finish or get bored or run

832
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
i'll either finish or get bored or run
 

833
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,029
i'll either finish or get bored or run
out of time we'll see what happens first

834
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
out of time we'll see what happens first
 

835
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,070
out of time we'll see what happens first
um so i'll be back in a bit and then

836
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
um so i'll be back in a bit and then
 

837
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,230
um so i'll be back in a bit and then
we'll try to test this out and see

838
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
we'll try to test this out and see
 

839
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,070
we'll try to test this out and see
how much gold we can get this is not

840
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
how much gold we can get this is not
 

841
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,909
how much gold we can get this is not
like like once i get this done this

842
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
like like once i get this done this
 

843
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,590
like like once i get this done this
isn't the end of the gold farm i need to

844
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
isn't the end of the gold farm i need to
 

845
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,510
isn't the end of the gold farm i need to
make a healing chamber

846
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
make a healing chamber
 

847
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,830
make a healing chamber
and i might want to make some way of

848
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
and i might want to make some way of
 

849
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,029
and i might want to make some way of
transporting the gold

850
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
transporting the gold
 

851
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,430
transporting the gold
up above the bedrock so i can actually

852
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
up above the bedrock so i can actually
 

853
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,390
up above the bedrock so i can actually
see

854
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
see
 

855
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,549
see
how much gold is producing while i'm up

856
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
how much gold is producing while i'm up
 

857
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,750
how much gold is producing while i'm up
there because i'm completely blind

858
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
there because i'm completely blind
 

859
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,510
there because i'm completely blind
when i'm on top of the nether i don't

860
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
when i'm on top of the nether i don't
 

861
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,350
when i'm on top of the nether i don't
know what's gonna what's going on with

862
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
know what's gonna what's going on with
 

863
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,630
know what's gonna what's going on with
the system

864
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
the system
 

865
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,909
the system
oh i'm missing slabs

866
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
oh i'm missing slabs
 

867
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,190
oh i'm missing slabs
hmm okay so i didn't quite finish i

868
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
hmm okay so i didn't quite finish i
 

869
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,710
hmm okay so i didn't quite finish i
forgot put slabs there

870
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
forgot put slabs there
 

871
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,270
forgot put slabs there
on this side and probably all the way

872
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
on this side and probably all the way
 

873
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,270
on this side and probably all the way
down

874
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280

 

875
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,029

things are going very well with the

878
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
things are going very well with the
 

879
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,230
things are going very well with the
build i'm in the middle of it still

880
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
build i'm in the middle of it still
 

881
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,590
build i'm in the middle of it still
but uh i decided to do

882
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
but uh i decided to do
 

883
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,230
but uh i decided to do
redstone first because the pistons were

884
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
redstone first because the pistons were
 

885
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,590
redstone first because the pistons were
going to be in the way if i did those

886
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
going to be in the way if i did those
 

887
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,190
going to be in the way if i did those
first

888
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
first
 

889
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,549
first
but then i did like three quarters of it

890
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
but then i did like three quarters of it
 

891
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,549
but then i did like three quarters of it
and ran out of redstone so i'm here

892
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
and ran out of redstone so i'm here
 

893
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,270
and ran out of redstone so i'm here
collecting

894
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
collecting
 

895
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,470
collecting
more this is my secret backup plan

896
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
more this is my secret backup plan
 

897
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,390
more this is my secret backup plan
in case i ran out this is my

898
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
in case i ran out this is my
 

899
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,710
in case i ran out this is my
unloaded chunk detector thing that i set

900
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
unloaded chunk detector thing that i set
 

901
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,150
unloaded chunk detector thing that i set
up a while ago

902
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
up a while ago
 

903
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,470
up a while ago
never ended up doing anything with it

904
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
never ended up doing anything with it
 

905
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,750
never ended up doing anything with it
yet

906
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
yet
 

907
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,750
yet
i might fix this in the future let's

908
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
i might fix this in the future let's
 

909
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,070
i might fix this in the future let's
actually leave this stuff

910
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
actually leave this stuff
 

911
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,350
actually leave this stuff
um but for now we're in desperate need

912
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
um but for now we're in desperate need
 

913
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,549
um but for now we're in desperate need
of redstone so i'm going to take this

914
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
of redstone so i'm going to take this
 

915
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,390
of redstone so i'm going to take this
and i'll leave the repeater zone in case

916
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
and i'll leave the repeater zone in case
 

917
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,510
and i'll leave the repeater zone in case
we ever want to repair it

918
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
we ever want to repair it
 

919
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,350
we ever want to repair it
this will give us more than enough to

920
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
this will give us more than enough to
 

921
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,870
this will give us more than enough to
finish because there's over a thousand

922
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
finish because there's over a thousand
 

923
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,350
finish because there's over a thousand
down here

924
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360

 

925
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,789

and i guess

926
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
and i guess
 

927
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,990
and i guess
you know i've been breaking this stuff

928
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
you know i've been breaking this stuff
 

929
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,430
you know i've been breaking this stuff
for a while i didn't even get four

930
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
for a while i didn't even get four
 

931
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,110
for a while i didn't even get four
stacks yet

932
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
stacks yet
 

933
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,110
stacks yet
man um well i guess i'll collect more

934
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
man um well i guess i'll collect more
 

935
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,750
man um well i guess i'll collect more
and i'll

936
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
and i'll
 

937
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,789
and i'll
i'll get back to it

938
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799

 

939
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,549

i did it i finished the whole thing i

940
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
i did it i finished the whole thing i
 

941
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,230
i did it i finished the whole thing i
can't believe it i did not think i was

942
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
can't believe it i did not think i was
 

943
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,150
can't believe it i did not think i was
going to do that today

944
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
going to do that today
 

945
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,110
going to do that today
um all the pistons all the redstone all

946
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
um all the pistons all the redstone all
 

947
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,230
um all the pistons all the redstone all
the screwing all that

948
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
the screwing all that
 

949
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,270
the screwing all that
tripwires everything it's all together

950
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
tripwires everything it's all together
 

951
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,909
tripwires everything it's all together
i gotta get a stinkin wall on this thing

952
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
i gotta get a stinkin wall on this thing
 

953
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,350
i gotta get a stinkin wall on this thing
though because

954
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
though because
 

955
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,870
though because
i got shot at by jazz so many times

956
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
i got shot at by jazz so many times
 

957
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,070
i got shot at by jazz so many times
and if the fireballs hits they

958
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
and if the fireballs hits they
 

959
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,510
and if the fireballs hits they
break a lot of stuff so

960
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
break a lot of stuff so
 

961
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,270
break a lot of stuff so
yeah i think i just saw a pigment fall

962
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
yeah i think i just saw a pigment fall
 

963
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,110
yeah i think i just saw a pigment fall
from it um

964
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
from it um
 

965
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,430
from it um
okay you'll notice something though like

966
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
okay you'll notice something though like
 

967
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,549
okay you'll notice something though like
from

968
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
from
 

969
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,710
from
from that height down they're gonna hit

970
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
from that height down they're gonna hit
 

971
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,470
from that height down they're gonna hit
the ground and they won't die from that

972
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
the ground and they won't die from that
 

973
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,590
the ground and they won't die from that
fall so we're gonna test this

974
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
fall so we're gonna test this
 

975
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,590
fall so we're gonna test this
now and just see what happens but like a

976
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
now and just see what happens but like a
 

977
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,190
now and just see what happens but like a
lot of these guys aren't actually gonna

978
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
lot of these guys aren't actually gonna
 

979
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,070
lot of these guys aren't actually gonna
die until we set up a proper killing

980
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
die until we set up a proper killing
 

981
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,830
die until we set up a proper killing
system for it

982
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
system for it
 

983
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,870
system for it
and i kind of think i might go for a

984
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:33,880
and i kind of think i might go for a
 

985
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,190
and i kind of think i might go for a
suffocation

986
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
suffocation
 

987
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,870
suffocation
thing uh just so they don't have to fall

988
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
thing uh just so they don't have to fall
 

989
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,980
thing uh just so they don't have to fall
24 blocks

990
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:41,990

there's a bunch of them around but

994
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
there's a bunch of them around but
 

995
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,870
there's a bunch of them around but
they're like stuck in these little caves

996
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
they're like stuck in these little caves
 

997
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,789
they're like stuck in these little caves
i think

998
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799

 

999
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,310

um and there are some refinements i need

1000
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
um and there are some refinements i need
 

1001
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,029
um and there are some refinements i need
to make to it like

1002
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
to make to it like
 

1003
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,510
to make to it like
i didn't i didn't protect the top so

1004
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
i didn't i didn't protect the top so
 

1005
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,230
i didn't i didn't protect the top so
some can spawn on the top still

1006
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
some can spawn on the top still
 

1007
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,909
some can spawn on the top still
i'll have to go through and fix that

1008
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
i'll have to go through and fix that
 

1009
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,310
i'll have to go through and fix that
might add some lighting

1010
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
might add some lighting
 

1011
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,590
might add some lighting
in the walls like i said

1012
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
in the walls like i said
 

1013
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,630
in the walls like i said
but let's go up this will be our first

1014
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
but let's go up this will be our first
 

1015
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,669
but let's go up this will be our first
official working test

1016
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
official working test
 

1017
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,950
official working test
usually i come up at a better spot

1018
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
usually i come up at a better spot
 

1019
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,630
usually i come up at a better spot
this will go here that works okay so to

1020
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
this will go here that works okay so to
 

1021
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,669
this will go here that works okay so to
test this thing

1022
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
test this thing
 

1023
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,390
test this thing
again uh the way we do that we gotta

1024
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
again uh the way we do that we gotta
 

1025
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,029
again uh the way we do that we gotta
climb this

1026
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
climb this
 

1027
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,870
climb this
ladder and notice

1028
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
ladder and notice
 

1029
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,350
ladder and notice
the e you see my mouse cursor the e here

1030
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
the e you see my mouse cursor the e here
 

1031
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,950
the e you see my mouse cursor the e here
that's entities

1032
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
that's entities
 

1033
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,870
that's entities
uh the first number is how many are

1034
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
uh the first number is how many are
 

1035
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,590
uh the first number is how many are
being rendered in our screen region

1036
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
being rendered in our screen region
 

1037
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,990
being rendered in our screen region
second number is how many are total

1038
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
second number is how many are total
 

1039
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,990
second number is how many are total
within the loaded area

1040
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
within the loaded area
 

1041
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,029
within the loaded area
so we have 66

1042
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
so we have 66
 

1043
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,950
so we have 66
total loaded most of those are probably

1044
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
total loaded most of those are probably
 

1045
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,750
total loaded most of those are probably
mobs

1046
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760

 

1047
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,750

but then as we get higher they're going

1048
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
but then as we get higher they're going
 

1049
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,549
but then as we get higher they're going
to start despawning

1050
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
to start despawning
 

1051
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,950
to start despawning
because if they're over 128 blocks away

1052
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
because if they're over 128 blocks away
 

1053
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,669
because if they're over 128 blocks away
from us

1054
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
from us
 

1055
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,350
from us
they are going to

1056
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
they are going to
 

1057
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,350
they are going to
despawn pretty quick and

1058
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
despawn pretty quick and
 

1059
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,230
despawn pretty quick and
90. the thing is i've also noticed as i

1060
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
90. the thing is i've also noticed as i
 

1061
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,909
90. the thing is i've also noticed as i
get higher here it seems like

1062
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
get higher here it seems like
 

1063
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,270
get higher here it seems like
the number of entities increases

1064
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
the number of entities increases
 

1065
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,510
the number of entities increases
like almost like the maximum number

1066
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
like almost like the maximum number
 

1067
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,070
like almost like the maximum number
allowed

1068
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080

 

1069
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,789

or the number of mobs possible increases

1070
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
or the number of mobs possible increases
 

1071
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,710
or the number of mobs possible increases
the higher i get here

1072
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
the higher i get here
 

1073
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,149
the higher i get here
because i thought it would go over a

1074
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
because i thought it would go over a
 

1075
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,549
because i thought it would go over a
hundred there

1076
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
hundred there
 

1077
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,590
hundred there
we get higher higher higher and now

1078
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
we get higher higher higher and now
 

1079
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,110
we get higher higher higher and now
we're at that sweet spot where

1080
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
we're at that sweet spot where
 

1081
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,669
we're at that sweet spot where
it's just the level i want they're

1082
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
it's just the level i want they're
 

1083
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,230
it's just the level i want they're
spawning really quick and then they're

1084
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
spawning really quick and then they're
 

1085
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,070
spawning really quick and then they're
despawning really quick so um

1086
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
despawning really quick so um
 

1087
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,950
despawning really quick so um
see we're at 246 think we can go down a

1088
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
see we're at 246 think we can go down a
 

1089
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,029
see we're at 246 think we can go down a
bit

1090
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
bit
 

1091
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,230
bit
i don't know what the the best height is

1092
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
i don't know what the the best height is
 

1093
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,710
i don't know what the the best height is
yet

1094
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
yet
 

1095
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,990
yet
but that's kind of why i want a

1096
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
but that's kind of why i want a
 

1097
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,909
but that's kind of why i want a
way of sending the gold up here so we

1098
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
way of sending the gold up here so we
 

1099
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,270
way of sending the gold up here so we
can actually see

1100
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
can actually see
 

1101
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,830
can actually see
how quickly it's running because at the

1102
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
how quickly it's running because at the
 

1103
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,149
how quickly it's running because at the
moment i have no clue i think this is

1104
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
moment i have no clue i think this is
 

1105
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,029
moment i have no clue i think this is
about the height we want though

1106
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039

 

1107
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,549

and i'm just going to hang out here for

1108
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
and i'm just going to hang out here for
 

1109
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,070
and i'm just going to hang out here for
a little bit then we'll go down and

1110
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
a little bit then we'll go down and
 

1111
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,029
a little bit then we'll go down and
check out

1112
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
check out
 

1113
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,029
check out
how much gold is on the ground and if

1114
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
how much gold is on the ground and if
 

1115
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,710
how much gold is on the ground and if
there's

1116
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
there's
 

1117
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,750
there's
um just to see what happens here i guess

1118
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
um just to see what happens here i guess
 

1119
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,270
um just to see what happens here i guess
i don't know exactly how well this is

1120
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
i don't know exactly how well this is
 

1121
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,950
i don't know exactly how well this is
going to work again this is a

1122
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
going to work again this is a
 

1123
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,190
going to work again this is a
experimental gold farm

1124
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
experimental gold farm
 

1125
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,110
experimental gold farm
i guess we can probably go down

1126
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120

 

1127
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,029

um and if you're wondering why i didn't

1128
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
um and if you're wondering why i didn't
 

1129
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,990
um and if you're wondering why i didn't
just make a giant portal

1130
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
just make a giant portal
 

1131
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,190
just make a giant portal
uh gold farm of some sort well

1132
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
uh gold farm of some sort well
 

1133
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,669
uh gold farm of some sort well
they didn't exist when i started this it

1134
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
they didn't exist when i started this it
 

1135
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,390
they didn't exist when i started this it
those just

1136
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
those just
 

1137
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,149
those just
came out and i think those actually got

1138
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
came out and i think those actually got
 

1139
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,149
came out and i think those actually got
nerfed so

1140
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
nerfed so
 

1141
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,789
nerfed so
maybe it's a good thing i didn't do that

1142
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
maybe it's a good thing i didn't do that
 

1143
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,590
maybe it's a good thing i didn't do that
um

1144
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600

 

1145
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,149

okay so i'm gonna go back into the

1146
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
okay so i'm gonna go back into the
 

1147
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,110
okay so i'm gonna go back into the
nether from

1148
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
nether from
 

1149
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,110
nether from
from beneath again and we'll see just

1150
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
from beneath again and we'll see just
 

1151
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,110
from beneath again and we'll see just
what happens

1152
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120

 

1153
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,630

okay we're going through here i don't

1154
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
okay we're going through here i don't
 

1155
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,230
okay we're going through here i don't
know really what kind of results i

1156
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
know really what kind of results i
 

1157
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,029
know really what kind of results i
i want or what i expect from this most

1158
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
i want or what i expect from this most
 

1159
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,430
i want or what i expect from this most
of them

1160
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
of them
 

1161
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,190
of them
most of the guys aren't even gonna die

1162
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
most of the guys aren't even gonna die
 

1163
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,630
most of the guys aren't even gonna die
from from this because they're not

1164
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
from from this because they're not
 

1165
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,750
from from this because they're not
falling far enough

1166
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
falling far enough
 

1167
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,510
falling far enough
um in fact even if i just got like

1168
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
um in fact even if i just got like
 

1169
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,269
um in fact even if i just got like
five golden nuggets that would be pretty

1170
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
five golden nuggets that would be pretty
 

1171
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,630
five golden nuggets that would be pretty
promising that's

1172
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
promising that's
 

1173
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,750
promising that's
the way it's set up right now

1174
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
the way it's set up right now
 

1175
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,390
the way it's set up right now
we gotta make a few changes to it um

1176
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400

 

1177
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,149

okay let's look around there's one

1178
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159

 

1179
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,190

some guys down here oh

1180
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
some guys down here oh
 

1181
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,549
some guys down here oh
two three so these spots they're falling

1182
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
two three so these spots they're falling
 

1183
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,310
two three so these spots they're falling
far enough where they'll die

1184
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
far enough where they'll die
 

1185
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,390
far enough where they'll die
i think i see one wandering around up

1186
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
i think i see one wandering around up
 

1187
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,870
i think i see one wandering around up
there actually

1188
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
there actually
 

1189
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,710
there actually
all the gas are gone too because we went

1190
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
all the gas are gone too because we went
 

1191
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,549
all the gas are gone too because we went
out of the range

1192
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
out of the range
 

1193
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,190
out of the range
there's another one uh that's nice

1194
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
there's another one uh that's nice
 

1195
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,390
there's another one uh that's nice
didn't hear again um that was really

1196
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
didn't hear again um that was really
 

1197
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,149
didn't hear again um that was really
getting on my nerves the longer you stay

1198
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
getting on my nerves the longer you stay
 

1199
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,070
getting on my nerves the longer you stay
in one spot in the nether the more gas

1200
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
in one spot in the nether the more gas
 

1201
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,870
in one spot in the nether the more gas
you'll get because they they take a long

1202
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
you'll get because they they take a long
 

1203
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,149
you'll get because they they take a long
time to spawn

1204
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
time to spawn
 

1205
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,549
time to spawn
and they don't despawn easily

1206
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559

 

1207
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,990

that's promising one two three four

1208
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
that's promising one two three four
 

1209
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,430
that's promising one two three four
i think this thing's gonna run really

1210
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
i think this thing's gonna run really
 

1211
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,830
i think this thing's gonna run really
well if i

1212
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
well if i
 

1213
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,750
well if i
if i fix things up there's actually a

1214
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
if i fix things up there's actually a
 

1215
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,870
if i fix things up there's actually a
few here too

1216
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
few here too
 

1217
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,110
few here too
yeah i'm pretty happy with that

1218
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
yeah i'm pretty happy with that
 

1219
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,669
yeah i'm pretty happy with that
so it's not much yet but

1220
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679

 

1221
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,510

okay that looks like they got the

1222
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
okay that looks like they got the
 

1223
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,029
okay that looks like they got the
pistons jammed

1224
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
pistons jammed
 

1225
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,950
pistons jammed
this design might have a few issues

1226
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
this design might have a few issues
 

1227
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,950
this design might have a few issues
actually

1228
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960

 

1229
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,190

let's go up here

1230
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,200
let's go up here

1249
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,630

okay well there's a few spots they're

1250
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
okay well there's a few spots they're
 

1251
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,710
okay well there's a few spots they're
spawning up there not falling so i'll

1252
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
spawning up there not falling so i'll
 

1253
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,630
spawning up there not falling so i'll
have to get rid of those

1254
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
have to get rid of those
 

1255
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,870
have to get rid of those
and i gotta clear a little bit more of

1256
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
and i gotta clear a little bit more of
 

1257
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,789
and i gotta clear a little bit more of
this netherrack too

1258
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
this netherrack too
 

1259
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,269
this netherrack too
like you can see there's a guy up there

1260
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
like you can see there's a guy up there
 

1261
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,190
like you can see there's a guy up there
that's that's wasting space where they

1262
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
that's that's wasting space where they
 

1263
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,710
that's that's wasting space where they
can spawn and not die

1264
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720

 

1265
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,710

the walls on probably get some lights in

1266
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
the walls on probably get some lights in
 

1267
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,630
the walls on probably get some lights in
here lots of guys at the top

1268
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
here lots of guys at the top
 

1269
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,110
here lots of guys at the top
another one over there yeah i'm pretty

1270
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
another one over there yeah i'm pretty
 

1271
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,789
another one over there yeah i'm pretty
happy with that result

1272
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
happy with that result
 

1273
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,029
happy with that result
considering like we were only up there

1274
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
considering like we were only up there
 

1275
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,549
considering like we were only up there
for

1276
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
for
 

1277
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,230
for
less than a minute at the right height

1278
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
less than a minute at the right height
 

1279
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,549
less than a minute at the right height
so that was

1280
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
so that was
 

1281
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,830
so that was
pretty good to get like 11 nuggets from

1282
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840
pretty good to get like 11 nuggets from
 

1283
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,149
pretty good to get like 11 nuggets from
that

1284
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
that
 

1285
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,350
that
too bad not too bad

1286
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
too bad not too bad
 

1287
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,549
too bad not too bad

all right well i'm gonna get the comment
 

1289
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,590
all right well i'm gonna get the comment
ready for our

1290
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
ready for our
 

1291
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,710
ready for our
question and i will probably call it an

1292
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
question and i will probably call it an
 

1293
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,750
question and i will probably call it an
end for today

1294
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760

 

1295
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,430

oh yeah by the way check this out this

1296
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
oh yeah by the way check this out this

00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
is crazy after
 

1299
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,070
is crazy after
after building all that just how much

1300
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
after building all that just how much
 

1301
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,630
after building all that just how much
redstone i had at the very end

1302
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640

 

1303
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,350

eight pieces and four pistons is what we

1304
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
eight pieces and four pistons is what we
 

1305
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,230
eight pieces and four pistons is what we
ended up with

1306
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
ended up with
 

1307
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,110
ended up with
that is unbelievable if one or two more

1308
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
that is unbelievable if one or two more
 

1309
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,190
that is unbelievable if one or two more
gas balls would have came my way

1310
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
gas balls would have came my way
 

1311
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,950
gas balls would have came my way
would not have had enough to finish i

1312
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
would not have had enough to finish i
 

1313
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,710
would not have had enough to finish i
don't think or it would have been a real

1314
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
don't think or it would have been a real
 

1315
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,310
don't think or it would have been a real
pain to get more

1316
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
pain to get more
 

1317
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,310
pain to get more
um so that was that's crazy worked out

1318
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
um so that was that's crazy worked out
 

1319
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,350
um so that was that's crazy worked out
great

1320
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360

to the snapshot
we'll probably do some snapshot related

1328
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
we'll probably do some snapshot related
 

1329
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,990
we'll probably do some snapshot related
stuff

1330
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,000
stuff
 

1331
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,830
