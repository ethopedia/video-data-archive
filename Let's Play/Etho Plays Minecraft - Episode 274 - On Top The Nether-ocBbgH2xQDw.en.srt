163
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,790
up though if we get Adam breaking I
might put it on these let's head on over

164
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
might put it on these let's head on over
 

165
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,330
might put it on these let's head on over
to the nether though so the plan I want

166
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,340
to the nether though so the plan I want
 

167
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,879
to the nether though so the plan I want
to try and make a zombie Pigman farm or

168
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:38,889
to try and make a zombie Pigman farm or
 

169
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,879
to try and make a zombie Pigman farm or
at least started today and I'm going to

170
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:41,889
at least started today and I'm going to
 

171
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,900
at least started today and I'm going to
go up on the roof of them

172
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:43,910
go up on the roof of them
 

173
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,380
go up on the roof of them
today I always wanted to do it I'm not

174
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,390
today I always wanted to do it I'm not
 

175
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,350
today I always wanted to do it I'm not
sure if I it's like breaking some

176
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,360
sure if I it's like breaking some
 

177
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,350
sure if I it's like breaking some
vanilla code or anything because it's

178
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
vanilla code or anything because it's
 

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,300
vanilla code or anything because it's
it's you know it's not really intended

180
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,310
it's you know it's not really intended
 

181
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,090
it's you know it's not really intended
for you to go on top of the nether but

182
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:01,100
for you to go on top of the nether but
 

183
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,200
for you to go on top of the nether but
at the same time it's possible so I kind

184
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,210
at the same time it's possible so I kind
 

185
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,090
at the same time it's possible so I kind
of want to do it I don't think it's

186
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,100
of want to do it I don't think it's
 

187
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,440
of want to do it I don't think it's
gonna cause any technical bugs so as far

188
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,450
gonna cause any technical bugs so as far
 

189
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,750
gonna cause any technical bugs so as far
as I know so I think I think it's okay

190
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:13,760
as I know so I think I think it's okay
 

191
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,080
as I know so I think I think it's okay
to go ahead with it and we're gonna use

192
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,090
to go ahead with it and we're gonna use
 

193
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,830
to go ahead with it and we're gonna use
that feature with our zombie Pigman farm

194
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:22,840

 

195
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,930

let's figure out the exact center here

196
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:25,940
let's figure out the exact center here
 

197
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,120
let's figure out the exact center here
this is probably what else Center the

198
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,130
this is probably what else Center the
 

199
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:34,570
this is probably what else Center the
farm on okay negative 4365 just writing

200
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:34,580
farm on okay negative 4365 just writing
 

201
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,810
farm on okay negative 4365 just writing
it down and Zed 11 perfect okay I'm

202
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:40,820
it down and Zed 11 perfect okay I'm
 

203
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,120
it down and Zed 11 perfect okay I'm
gonna grab some netherrack wow that's

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,130
gonna grab some netherrack wow that's
 

205
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,870
gonna grab some netherrack wow that's
loud

206
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:45,880

 

207
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,070

let's maybe just turn this down a bit

208
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
let's maybe just turn this down a bit
 

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,360
let's maybe just turn this down a bit
today all right so we're gonna go up

210
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,370
today all right so we're gonna go up
 

211
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,990
today all right so we're gonna go up
right above here just on pillar up I

212
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
right above here just on pillar up I
 

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
right above here just on pillar up I
just is probably the easiest way and I

214
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,690
just is probably the easiest way and I
 

215
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,810
just is probably the easiest way and I
brought a bow and everything just in

216
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:01,820
brought a bow and everything just in
 

217
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,240
brought a bow and everything just in
case we have trouble this is where I put

218
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,250
case we have trouble this is where I put
 

219
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,260
case we have trouble this is where I put
the beach in by the way just above there

220
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,270
the beach in by the way just above there
 

221
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,270
the beach in by the way just above there
and I got to make sure we don't block

222
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
and I got to make sure we don't block
 

223
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,080
and I got to make sure we don't block
the beam to that too

224
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,090
the beam to that too
 

225
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,250
the beam to that too
all right so we're about eighty four and

226
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,260
all right so we're about eighty four and
 

227
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,920
all right so we're about eighty four and
let's keep going up this is gonna be

228
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:23,930
let's keep going up this is gonna be
 

229
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,500
let's keep going up this is gonna be
cool I'm gonna put a portal on top I'm

230
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,510
cool I'm gonna put a portal on top I'm
 

231
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,180
cool I'm gonna put a portal on top I'm
gonna put an ender chest up there too

232
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,190
gonna put an ender chest up there too
 

233
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,450
gonna put an ender chest up there too
and some other stuff so we don't have to

234
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,460
and some other stuff so we don't have to
 

235
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,909
and some other stuff so we don't have to
die to get back in this game like if you

236
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:36,919
die to get back in this game like if you
 

237
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,120
die to get back in this game like if you
ever get trapped on top of the nether or

238
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,130
ever get trapped on top of the nether or
 

239
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,500
ever get trapped on top of the nether or
trapped anywhere you can always kill

240
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,510
trapped anywhere you can always kill
 

241
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,610
trapped anywhere you can always kill
yourself with starvation by the way so

242
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:45,620
yourself with starvation by the way so
 

243
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,140
yourself with starvation by the way so
don't feel like you're stuck you will

244
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,150
don't feel like you're stuck you will
 

245
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,980
don't feel like you're stuck you will
lose your stuff but you you can continue

246
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:50,990
lose your stuff but you you can continue
 

247
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,510
lose your stuff but you you can continue
playing you don't have to get like a

248
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:52,520
playing you don't have to get like a
 

249
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,090
playing you don't have to get like a
server admin or whatever if you're

250
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,100
server admin or whatever if you're
 

251
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,400
server admin or whatever if you're
playing on a server to get you down

252
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,410
playing on a server to get you down
 

253
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,980
playing on a server to get you down
they were why 122 let's go away from the

254
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:03,990
they were why 122 let's go away from the
 

255
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,140
they were why 122 let's go away from the
beacon actually so I don't mess that up

256
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,150
beacon actually so I don't mess that up
 

257
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,190
beacon actually so I don't mess that up
I think we got to get up to or ideally

258
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,200
I think we got to get up to or ideally
 

259
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,850
I think we got to get up to or ideally
we got to get up I'm sure we'll find a

260
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:16,860
we got to get up I'm sure we'll find a
 

261
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,980
we got to get up I'm sure we'll find a
spot not there I want a nice this

262
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:21,990
spot not there I want a nice this
 

263
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,250
spot not there I want a nice this
doesn't look too bad I think I think

264
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,260
doesn't look too bad I think I think
 

265
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,810
doesn't look too bad I think I think
that might be a good over here actually

266
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:28,820

 

267
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,110

124 I think we can get up to 125 yeah

268
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
124 I think we can get up to 125 yeah
 

269
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,029
124 I think we can get up to 125 yeah
look at that so we can get one more

270
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
look at that so we can get one more
 

271
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:46,970
look at that so we can get one more
block higher mmm well I could ender

272
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:46,980
block higher mmm well I could ender
 

273
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,920
block higher mmm well I could ender
pearl into that I don't really want to

274
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:48,930
pearl into that I don't really want to
 

275
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,340
pearl into that I don't really want to
maybe this is first time we'll do it

276
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,350
maybe this is first time we'll do it
 

277
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,350
maybe this is first time we'll do it
okay on top of the nether whoo awesome

278
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
okay on top of the nether whoo awesome
 

279
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,960
okay on top of the nether whoo awesome
all right so what was the center 43

280
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:07,970

 

281
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,620

negative 43 I'm just gonna March it 11

282
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,630

 

283
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,170

so the beacon is directly below us here

284
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,180
so the beacon is directly below us here
 

285
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,040
so the beacon is directly below us here
I'm not gonna block it I'm just gonna oh

286
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,050
I'm not gonna block it I'm just gonna oh
 

287
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,990
I'm not gonna block it I'm just gonna oh
that looked bad oh that scared me the

288
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,000
that looked bad oh that scared me the
 

289
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,430
that looked bad oh that scared me the
cobble like went invisible there oh and

290
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
cobble like went invisible there oh and
 

291
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,770
cobble like went invisible there oh and
I lost my a speed oh I may have just

292
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:39,780
I lost my a speed oh I may have just
 

293
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,730
I lost my a speed oh I may have just
killed the beacon because I think I

294
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
killed the beacon because I think I
 

295
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,300
killed the beacon because I think I
raised the sky limit now

296
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,310
raised the sky limit now
 

297
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,100
raised the sky limit now
[Music]

298
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,110
[Music]
 

299
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,660
[Music]
okay so there are some side effects to

300
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:50,670
okay so there are some side effects to
 

301
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,530
okay so there are some side effects to
this it seems not to worry because we

302
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
this it seems not to worry because we
 

303
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,570
this it seems not to worry because we
can move the beacon up here and then

304
00:09:59,570 --> 00:09:59,580
can move the beacon up here and then
 

305
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,470
can move the beacon up here and then
it'll be fine

306
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480

 

307
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,680

yeah I didn't think it's gonna kill the

308
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:06,690
yeah I didn't think it's gonna kill the
 

309
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,240
yeah I didn't think it's gonna kill the
beacon all right I'm gonna put down a

310
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,250
beacon all right I'm gonna put down a
 

311
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:19,760
beacon all right I'm gonna put down a
portal so the way I'm gonna do this I'm

312
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:19,770
portal so the way I'm gonna do this I'm
 

313
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,830
portal so the way I'm gonna do this I'm
gonna build our zombie Pigman farm

314
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:21,840
gonna build our zombie Pigman farm
 

315
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,810
gonna build our zombie Pigman farm
underneath the bedrock like just

316
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:23,820
underneath the bedrock like just
 

317
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,810
underneath the bedrock like just
directly underneath it and then to use

318
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:26,820

a lot of you are familiar with where you

392
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
a lot of you are familiar with where you
 

393
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,639
a lot of you are familiar with where you
build your spawning pads up in there and

394
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:52,649
build your spawning pads up in there and
 

395
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,299
build your spawning pads up in there and
then the mobs fall down but I'm doing it

396
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:56,309
then the mobs fall down but I'm doing it
 

397
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,970
then the mobs fall down but I'm doing it
sort of in Reverse I'm building the pads

398
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:58,980
sort of in Reverse I'm building the pads
 

399
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,939
sort of in Reverse I'm building the pads
below the ground here like right below

400
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:01,949
below the ground here like right below
 

401
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,600
below the ground here like right below
it and then they're gonna fall below

402
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:05,610
it and then they're gonna fall below
 

403
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,329
it and then they're gonna fall below
that as well and we're gonna be above

404
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339
that as well and we're gonna be above
 

405
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,069
that as well and we're gonna be above
that the reason we're not just like

406
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
that the reason we're not just like
 

407
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,379
that the reason we're not just like
standing here and building our our

408

standing here and building our our
 

409
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,470
standing here and building our our
spawning pads above is because when I'm

410
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
spawning pads above is because when I'm
 

411
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,869
spawning pads above is because when I'm
standing here I'm still within range of

standing here I'm still within range of

00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
spaces to spawn the mobs so it it
 

435
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,909

high before that happens I'm actually

456
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:33,510
high before that happens I'm actually
 

457
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,050
high before that happens I'm actually
kind of surprised that the number is

458
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,060
kind of surprised that the number is
 

459
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,020
kind of surprised that the number is
going up I'm wondering what's causing

460
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,030
going up I'm wondering what's causing
 

461
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:46,580
going up I'm wondering what's causing
that now like 93 I'm thinking maybe the

462
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:46,590
that now like 93 I'm thinking maybe the
 

463
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,310
that now like 93 I'm thinking maybe the
max mob now is dependent on the load of

464
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:49,320
max mob now is dependent on the load of
 

465
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,180
max mob now is dependent on the load of
chunks I'm not sure now it's kind of

466
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,190
chunks I'm not sure now it's kind of
 

467
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,980
chunks I'm not sure now it's kind of
interesting in fact I'm gonna attest

468
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:54,990
interesting in fact I'm gonna attest
 

469
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:02,150
interesting in fact I'm gonna attest
that if I quit come back so I'll see you

470
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
that if I quit come back so I'll see you
 

471

let's keep going here is it 80 any
 

477
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,820
let's keep going here is it 80 any
moment now we're gonna start getting out

478
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:16,830
moment now we're gonna start getting out
 

479
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,900
moment now we're gonna start getting out
of range I thought it would have

480
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:17,910
of range I thought it would have
 

481
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,880
of range I thought it would have
happened already oh yeah you can see

482
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:19,890
happened already oh yeah you can see
 

483
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,570
happened already oh yeah you can see
it's starting to drop now there must be

484
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,580
it's starting to drop now there must be
 

485
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,520
it's starting to drop now there must be
a lot of spawning spaces in the ceiling

486
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,530
a lot of spawning spaces in the ceiling
 

487
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,740
a lot of spawning spaces in the ceiling
but we're gonna be clearing out a little

488
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:27,750
but we're gonna be clearing out a little
 

489
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,220
but we're gonna be clearing out a little
bit of space still just not as much as

490
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,230
bit of space still just not as much as
 

491
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,500
bit of space still just not as much as
we would need to if we builds down below

492
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,510
we would need to if we builds down below
 

493
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,100
we would need to if we builds down below
and you can see as I get near the top

494
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,110
and you can see as I get near the top
 

495
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,640
and you can see as I get near the top
here that number the e is going down to

496
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:40,650
here that number the e is going down to
 

497
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:47,000
here that number the e is going down to
0 just we're at the top here

498
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,010
0 just we're at the top here
 

499
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,020
0 just we're at the top here
I don't think oh you know what it is I

500
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,030
I don't think oh you know what it is I
 

501
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,230
I don't think oh you know what it is I
think some Pigman spawned on the beacon

502
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
think some Pigman spawned on the beacon
 

503
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,880
think some Pigman spawned on the beacon
because that's the only place for them

504
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:55,890
because that's the only place for them
 

505
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,470
because that's the only place for them
to spawn so that's why we still have

506
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
to spawn so that's why we still have
 

507
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,780
to spawn so that's why we still have
like 10 or so loaded but you can see the

508
00:15:59,780 --> 00:15:59,790
like 10 or so loaded but you can see the
 

509
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,500
like 10 or so loaded but you can see the
numbers jumping up and down really quick

510
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,510
numbers jumping up and down really quick
 

511
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,760
numbers jumping up and down really quick
because they're spawning outside of that

512
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:04,770
because they're spawning outside of that
 

513
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,120
because they're spawning outside of that
128 block range like if they spawn at

514
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,130
128 block range like if they spawn at
 

515
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,600
128 block range like if they spawn at
the bottom of the nether or anywhere

516
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:10,610
the bottom of the nether or anywhere
 

517
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,460
the bottom of the nether or anywhere
below the bedrock at this point they're

518
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,470
below the bedrock at this point they're
 

519
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,290
below the bedrock at this point they're
gonna instantly despawn on us so

520
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,300

 

521
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,450

that's that's the general idea behind it

522
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:25,460

 

523
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,360

and so if we create a trap like an area

524
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,370
and so if we create a trap like an area
 

525
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,640
and so if we create a trap like an area
where we want them to spawn where it's

526
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:31,650
where we want them to spawn where it's
 

527
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,380
where we want them to spawn where it's
doing that they're gonna spawn very

528
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,390
doing that they're gonna spawn very
 

529
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,200
doing that they're gonna spawn very
quickly on our our small spawning pads

530
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,210
quickly on our our small spawning pads
 

531
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,800
quickly on our our small spawning pads
and only in our trap so that is our goal

532
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:39,810
and only in our trap so that is our goal
 

533
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,600
and only in our trap so that is our goal
and as we get down here we'll probably

534
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:41,610
and as we get down here we'll probably
 

535
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,860
and as we get down here we'll probably
see a bunch of pigment I'm assuming yeah

536
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:45,870
see a bunch of pigment I'm assuming yeah
 

537
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,980
see a bunch of pigment I'm assuming yeah
look at them there's the only place they

538
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:48,990
look at them there's the only place they
 

539
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,450
look at them there's the only place they
could spawn was on the top of this

540
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:50,460
could spawn was on the top of this
 

541
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,540
could spawn was on the top of this
beacon and I think the portal there so

542
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,550
beacon and I think the portal there so
 

543
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,260
beacon and I think the portal there so
they spawn

544
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,270
they spawn
 

545
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:00,530
they spawn
very quickly ah man I messed up guys I

546
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,540
very quickly ah man I messed up guys I
 

547
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,450
very quickly ah man I messed up guys I
thought I read somewhere that beacons

548
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:02,460
thought I read somewhere that beacons
 

549
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,730
thought I read somewhere that beacons
like affect the whole chunk now

550
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:04,740
like affect the whole chunk now
 

551
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,490
like affect the whole chunk now
vertically if it's in the range but I

552
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:09,500
vertically if it's in the range but I
 

553
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,290
vertically if it's in the range but I
must have just totally got that wrong

554
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,300
must have just totally got that wrong
 

555
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,650
must have just totally got that wrong
because it only comes into effect if I

556
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:14,660
because it only comes into effect if I
 

557
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,670
because it only comes into effect if I
get within the 50 radius of it like it's

558
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:19,680
get within the 50 radius of it like it's
 

559
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,160
get within the 50 radius of it like it's
always been I just thought it'd change

560
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,170
always been I just thought it'd change
 

561
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,100
always been I just thought it'd change
for some reason so that means the beacon

562
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,110
for some reason so that means the beacon
 

563
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,490
for some reason so that means the beacon
is way too high and I'll have to move it

564
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,500
is way too high and I'll have to move it
 

565
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,880
is way too high and I'll have to move it
again somewhere but we messed up our sky

566
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:31,890
again somewhere but we messed up our sky
 

567
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,120
again somewhere but we messed up our sky
line so I can't put it back either I'll

568
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,130
line so I can't put it back either I'll
 

569
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,700
line so I can't put it back either I'll
have to find a new place for it but

570
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:37,710
have to find a new place for it but
 

571
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,170
have to find a new place for it but
anyway guess what we have to clear out a

572
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,180
anyway guess what we have to clear out a
 

573
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,230
anyway guess what we have to clear out a
bunch of space for the spawning pads I'm

574
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,240
bunch of space for the spawning pads I'm
 

575
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,210
bunch of space for the spawning pads I'm
hoping this does the trick it's

576
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
hoping this does the trick it's
 

577
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,260
hoping this does the trick it's
definitely not gonna be the most

578
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,270
definitely not gonna be the most
 

579
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,790
definitely not gonna be the most
efficient way or efficient most blocks

580
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:52,800
efficient way or efficient most blocks
 

581
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,010
efficient way or efficient most blocks
you can break with the TNT doing it this

582
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,020
you can break with the TNT doing it this
 

583
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,090
you can break with the TNT doing it this
way but it's it's a quickest way to set

584
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,100
way but it's it's a quickest way to set
 

585
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,230
way but it's it's a quickest way to set
it up so let's have some fun I guess

586
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,240
it up so let's have some fun I guess
 

587
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,150
it up so let's have some fun I guess
I'll do this let's break this as well

588
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
I'll do this let's break this as well
 

589
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,450
I'll do this let's break this as well
it's about a stack I had a stack to

590
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
it's about a stack I had a stack to
 

591
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
it's about a stack I had a stack to
start off with I got eight left right

592
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,470
start off with I got eight left right
 

593
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:21,440
start off with I got eight left right
now yeah

594
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,450

 

595
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,620

bombs away Oh what that do you oh it

596
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:28,630
bombs away Oh what that do you oh it
 

597
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,630
bombs away Oh what that do you oh it
blew up I thought it's gonna blow down

598
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640

 

599
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,570

yeah well you know what that worked that

600
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:36,580
yeah well you know what that worked that
 

601
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,210
yeah well you know what that worked that
worked pretty good in fact if I just did

602
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:39,220
worked pretty good in fact if I just did
 

603
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,040
worked pretty good in fact if I just did
a couple more of those

604
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,050

 

605
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,480

yeah that would take care of pretty much

606
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,490
yeah that would take care of pretty much
 

607
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:54,420
yeah that would take care of pretty much
the whole thing mm-hmm so what we're

608
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,430
the whole thing mm-hmm so what we're
 

609
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,790
the whole thing mm-hmm so what we're
trying to do with this thing this is our

610
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:56,800
trying to do with this thing this is our
 

611
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,960
trying to do with this thing this is our
center point for the mob system right

612
00:18:59,960 --> 00:18:59,970
center point for the mob system right
 

613
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,270
center point for the mob system right
we're gonna be way up in the sky at this

614
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
we're gonna be way up in the sky at this
 

615
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,540
we're gonna be way up in the sky at this
point here above the bedrock right and

616
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,550
point here above the bedrock right and
 

617
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,320
point here above the bedrock right and
then we need to imagine like semi-sphere

618
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,330
then we need to imagine like semi-sphere
 

619
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,040
then we need to imagine like semi-sphere
starting there and expanding out

620
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,050
starting there and expanding out
 

621
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,260
starting there and expanding out
depending on what height we end up being

622
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,270
depending on what height we end up being
 

623
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,340
depending on what height we end up being
the lower the better so we want to kind

624
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,350
the lower the better so we want to kind
 

625
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,390
the lower the better so we want to kind
of cut out a semi sphere here if we can

626
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
of cut out a semi sphere here if we can
 

627
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,930
of cut out a semi sphere here if we can
and then also we need to dig down as

628
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:27,940
and then also we need to dig down as
 

629
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,900
and then also we need to dig down as
well to give the mobs like a 24 volt

630
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:30,910
well to give the mobs like a 24 volt
 

631
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,720
well to give the mobs like a 24 volt
drop so that they'll die and they'll

632
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:33,730
drop so that they'll die and they'll
 

633
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,310
drop so that they'll die and they'll
probably land on hoppers and stuff and

634
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,320
probably land on hoppers and stuff and
 

635
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,280
probably land on hoppers and stuff and
get their resources collected or

636
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,290
get their resources collected or
 

637
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,600
get their resources collected or
something like that so if we cleared out

638
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:42,610
something like that so if we cleared out
 

639
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,690
something like that so if we cleared out
maybe maybe twice to three times the

640
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:48,700
maybe maybe twice to three times the
 

641
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,610
maybe maybe twice to three times the
space like a circle two or three times

642
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:50,620
space like a circle two or three times
 

643
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,550
space like a circle two or three times
bigger than that I think that would be

644
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:53,560
bigger than that I think that would be
 

645
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,260
bigger than that I think that would be
plenty so it just so happens and we did

646
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,270
plenty so it just so happens and we did
 

647
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,220
plenty so it just so happens and we did
it have some fun this is most of my tnt

648
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,230
it have some fun this is most of my tnt
 

649
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:22,230
it have some fun this is most of my tnt
supply oh no I did not have an escape

650
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240

 

651
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,700

okay let's see what that did

652
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:24,710
okay let's see what that did
 

653
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,610
okay let's see what that did
let's even reflect our stuff oh that's a

654
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:27,620
let's even reflect our stuff oh that's a
 

655
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,650
let's even reflect our stuff oh that's a
nice big pocket I did see quite a bit of

656
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:32,660
nice big pocket I did see quite a bit of
 

657
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,600
nice big pocket I did see quite a bit of
our stuff when I died so I think it

658
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:34,610
our stuff when I died so I think it
 

659
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,770
our stuff when I died so I think it
survived mostly I supplied it quite

660
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:38,780
survived mostly I supplied it quite
 

661
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,630
survived mostly I supplied it quite

although there's a big wall there - I'll

810
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:08,650
although there's a big wall there - I'll
 

811
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,640
although there's a big wall there - I'll
have to deal with so I went through and

812
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:14,650
have to deal with so I went through and
 

813
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,410
have to deal with so I went through and
cleared a little bit of land here with

814
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:16,420
cleared a little bit of land here with
 

815
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,780
cleared a little bit of land here with
the pick some of the corners I did that

816
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:18,790
the pick some of the corners I did that
 

817
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,230
the pick some of the corners I did that
one

818
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,240
one
 

819
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,930
one
I still go clear a bit more it goes

820
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:21,940
I still go clear a bit more it goes
 

821
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,890
I still go clear a bit more it goes
pretty quick and I also cleared that one

822
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:25,900
pretty quick and I also cleared that one
 

823
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,350
pretty quick and I also cleared that one
a bit still got to do that one and that

824
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,360
a bit still got to do that one and that
 

825
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,890
a bit still got to do that one and that
one and yeah the idea is just to make

826
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:31,900
one and yeah the idea is just to make
 

827
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,590
one and yeah the idea is just to make
this round you know we'll probably have

828
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:34,600
this round you know we'll probably have
 

829
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,050
this round you know we'll probably have
to put somewhat of a cage on this thing

830
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,060
to put somewhat of a cage on this thing
 

831
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,600
to put somewhat of a cage on this thing
too so gas can't shoot the spotting pads

832
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:39,610
too so gas can't shoot the spotting pads
 

833
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,530
too so gas can't shoot the spotting pads
I build and I just set up a little fake

834
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:43,540
I build and I just set up a little fake
 

835
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,050
I build and I just set up a little fake
spawning pad thing here to see what kind

836
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,060
spawning pad thing here to see what kind
 

837
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,180
spawning pad thing here to see what kind
of rates we get from this if we can the

838
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,190
of rates we get from this if we can the
 

839
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,610
of rates we get from this if we can the
problem is problem is it's really hard

840
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,620
problem is problem is it's really hard
 

841
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,670
problem is problem is it's really hard
to see what kind of spawning rates we

842
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,680
to see what kind of spawning rates we
 

843
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,050
to see what kind of spawning rates we
actually get because we're gonna be on

844
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,060
actually get because we're gonna be on
 

845
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,270
actually get because we're gonna be on
top of the nether and we can't just go

846
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,280
top of the nether and we can't just go
 

847
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,380
top of the nether and we can't just go
down real quick and check oh I hope it

848
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,390
down real quick and check oh I hope it
 

849
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,450
down real quick and check oh I hope it
in throw one I think we're good but I'm

850
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:12,460
in throw one I think we're good but I'm
 

851
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,870
in throw one I think we're good but I'm
gonna try a test here so I think we

852
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
gonna try a test here so I think we
 

853
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,150
gonna try a test here so I think we
should go maybe a hundred blocks up hold

854
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,160
should go maybe a hundred blocks up hold
 

855
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,220
should go maybe a hundred blocks up hold
that position for a little bit and then

856
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,230
that position for a little bit and then
 

857
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,070
that position for a little bit and then
leave the nether and I would like to see

858
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
leave the nether and I would like to see
 

859
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,440
leave the nether and I would like to see
a couple zombie pigman on that fake

860
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,450
a couple zombie pigman on that fake
 

861
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,230
a couple zombie pigman on that fake
spawning pad if there is there's a good

862
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,240
spawning pad if there is there's a good
 

863
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,270
spawning pad if there is there's a good
son that's a good sign that this is

864
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,280
son that's a good sign that this is
 

865
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,660
son that's a good sign that this is
gonna work out really well

866
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:41,670
gonna work out really well
 

867
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,960
gonna work out really well
and if there's not well maybe just got

868
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:45,970
and if there's not well maybe just got
 

869
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,890
and if there's not well maybe just got
on that year

870
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:46,900
on that year
 

871
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,220
on that year
mess something up so ceiling of the

872
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,230
mess something up so ceiling of the
 

873
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,450
mess something up so ceiling of the
nethers 128 let's go quite have enough

874
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:57,460
nethers 128 let's go quite have enough
 

875
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:04,200
nethers 128 let's go quite have enough
to finish let's go up to about to 28 to

876
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,210
to finish let's go up to about to 28 to
 

877
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,820
to finish let's go up to about to 28 to
30 or whatever okay numbers are bouncing

878
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:08,830
30 or whatever okay numbers are bouncing
 

879
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,160
30 or whatever okay numbers are bouncing
that's good hold this position for a

880
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,170
that's good hold this position for a
 

881
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,040
that's good hold this position for a
little bit I gotta be careful when I

882
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,050
little bit I gotta be careful when I
 

883
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,780
little bit I gotta be careful when I
ender pearl here if there's Pigman on

884
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:18,790
ender pearl here if there's Pigman on
 

885
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,220
ender pearl here if there's Pigman on
that beacon I might hit them

886
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,230
that beacon I might hit them
 

887
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:28,250
that beacon I might hit them
alright that's probably enough time whoo

888
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,260
alright that's probably enough time whoo
 

889
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,799
alright that's probably enough time whoo
okay so I'm gonna go out of here then

890
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:31,809
okay so I'm gonna go out of here then
 

891
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,049
okay so I'm gonna go out of here then
I'm gonna re-enter at the hub and go up

892
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:34,059
I'm gonna re-enter at the hub and go up
 

893
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:39,270
I'm gonna re-enter at the hub and go up
as quick as I can to check the pad all

894
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,280
as quick as I can to check the pad all
 

895
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,650
as quick as I can to check the pad all
right I'm gonna reenter the nether now

896
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:40,660
right I'm gonna reenter the nether now
 

897
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,160
right I'm gonna reenter the nether now
at the hub and since we're entering

898
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,170
at the hub and since we're entering
 

899
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,730
at the hub and since we're entering
within 128 blocks of those that fake

900
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:47,740
within 128 blocks of those that fake
 

901
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,450
within 128 blocks of those that fake
spawning pad I think should work out

902
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:51,460
spawning pad I think should work out
 

903
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,410
spawning pad I think should work out
okay as long as we get up there quick

904
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:55,420
okay as long as we get up there quick
 

905
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,750
okay as long as we get up there quick
cuz we're over 32 blocks wait so they

906
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:57,760
cuz we're over 32 blocks wait so they
 

907
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,020
cuz we're over 32 blocks wait so they
can be spun over time terrible throw ah

908
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,030
can be spun over time terrible throw ah
 

909
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,610
can be spun over time terrible throw ah
oh yes

910

Pigman laying around this area so as I

918
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,150
Pigman laying around this area so as I
 

919
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,540
Pigman laying around this area so as I
clear out more land and get lots of

920
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:27,550
clear out more land and get lots of
 

921
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,840
clear out more land and get lots of
spawning beds done I suspect this is

922
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:30,850
spawning beds done I suspect this is
 

923
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,720
spawning beds done I suspect this is
gonna work very well I'm gonna use a

924
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:32,730
gonna work very well I'm gonna use a
 

925
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,820
gonna work very well I'm gonna use a
piston pushers to knock them off the

926
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:35,830
piston pushers to knock them off the
 

927
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:43,140
piston pushers to knock them off the
pads I think and hoppers to clacks so I

928
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,150
pads I think and hoppers to clacks so I
 

929
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,030
pads I think and hoppers to clacks so I
think the idea is gonna work

930
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,040
think the idea is gonna work
 

931
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,190
think the idea is gonna work
it's just gonna

932
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
it's just gonna
 

933
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,049
it's just gonna
I'm gonna have to work on it and I'll

934
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:49,059
I'm gonna have to work on it and I'll
 

935
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,930
I'm gonna have to work on it and I'll
probably do a lot of it off camera

936
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:51,940
probably do a lot of it off camera
 

937
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,200
probably do a lot of it off camera
because it's a big project and we're

938
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,210
because it's a big project and we're
 

939
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,509
because it's a big project and we're
doing the world tour next episode guys

940
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:57,519
doing the world tour next episode guys
 

941
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,539
doing the world tour next episode guys
so look forward to that I think we're

942
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:00,549
so look forward to that I think we're
 

943
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,700
so look forward to that I think we're
going to go read the comments now for

944
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:02,710
going to go read the comments now for
 

945
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,039
going to go read the comments now for
today though and let's do it

946
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,049
today though and let's do it
 

947
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,969
today though and let's do it
I got a comment fit for today this is

948
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:11,979
I got a comment fit for today this is
 

949
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,879
I got a comment fit for today this is
based on last episode etho I think the

950
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:14,889
based on last episode etho I think the
 

951
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:16,769
based on last episode etho I think the
reason the nether village isn't working

952
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:16,779
reason the nether village isn't working
 

953
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:18,629
reason the nether village isn't working
might be because you're using
