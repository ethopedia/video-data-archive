to do building is more of an artistic
thing

170
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
thing
 

171
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,910
thing
there's a lot of ways you could do

172
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
there's a lot of ways you could do
 

173
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,589
there's a lot of ways you could do
something and i

174
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
something and i
 

175
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,190
something and i
i struggle with that because i want to

176
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
i struggle with that because i want to
 

177
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,110
i struggle with that because i want to
know the right way

178
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
know the right way
 

179
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,229
know the right way
or know exactly what i'm doing um

180
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
or know exactly what i'm doing um
 

181
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,149
or know exactly what i'm doing um
so i i ho-hum a lot when i'm building it

182
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
so i i ho-hum a lot when i'm building it
 

183
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,589
so i i ho-hum a lot when i'm building it
i try something

184
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
i try something
 

185
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,229
i try something
don't like it redo it try it maybe

186
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
don't like it redo it try it maybe
 

187
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,430
don't like it redo it try it maybe
that's better maybe it's not

188
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
that's better maybe it's not
 

189
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,750
that's better maybe it's not
try another thing a lot of trial and

190
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
try another thing a lot of trial and
 

191
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,190
try another thing a lot of trial and
error instead of actually knowing what

192
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
error instead of actually knowing what
 

193
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,470
error instead of actually knowing what
i'm doing

194
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
i'm doing
 

195
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,110
i'm doing
i find oh i don't like this we're too

196
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
i find oh i don't like this we're too
 

197
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,789
i find oh i don't like this we're too
close to this fence

198
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
close to this fence
 

199
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,710
close to this fence
should we fill this in we have a hole

200
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
should we fill this in we have a hole
 

201
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,390
should we fill this in we have a hole
here should we make this a lake or

202
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
here should we make this a lake or
 

203
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,990
here should we make this a lake or
a mine or something i'm not sure

204
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000

 

205
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,149

okay so we got a little bit of a path

206
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
okay so we got a little bit of a path
 

207
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,190
okay so we got a little bit of a path
started here

208
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
started here
 

209
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
started here
uh i just used gravel and i mixed in

210
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
uh i just used gravel and i mixed in
 

211
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,430
uh i just used gravel and i mixed in
some cobble and some andesite to give it

212
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
some cobble and some andesite to give it
 

213
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,190
some cobble and some andesite to give it
a bit of variation

214
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
a bit of variation
 

215
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,949
a bit of variation
uh it's a bit of a weird spot we have

216
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
uh it's a bit of a weird spot we have
 

217
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,550
uh it's a bit of a weird spot we have
the village on this side and then the

218
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
the village on this side and then the
 

219
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,390
the village on this side and then the
farmer field on the left here and

220
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
farmer field on the left here and
 

221
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,070
farmer field on the left here and
for some reason i left a bit of a space

222
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
for some reason i left a bit of a space
 

223
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,509
for some reason i left a bit of a space
between the two

224
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
between the two
 

225
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,110
between the two
so it's like what do you do what do you

226
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
so it's like what do you do what do you
 

227
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,710
so it's like what do you do what do you
do with this area just put a path

228
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
do with this area just put a path
 

229
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,190
do with this area just put a path
through it

230
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
through it
 

231
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,550
through it
i guess okay something that might look

232
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
i guess okay something that might look
 

233
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,869
i guess okay something that might look
cool is if we had trees on both the left

234
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
cool is if we had trees on both the left
 

235
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,589
cool is if we had trees on both the left
and the right

236
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
and the right
 

237
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,229
and the right
here so i'm gonna try cheese it to begin

238
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
here so i'm gonna try cheese it to begin
 

239
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,150
here so i'm gonna try cheese it to begin
with see if we can get oak trees to look

240
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
with see if we can get oak trees to look
 

241
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,310
with see if we can get oak trees to look
good

242
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
good
 

243
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,909
good
like that and that's gonna force it to

244
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
like that and that's gonna force it to
 

245
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,749
like that and that's gonna force it to
be a tall oak tree

246
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
be a tall oak tree
 

247
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,150
be a tall oak tree
uh you want the the stone on the right

248
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
uh you want the the stone on the right
 

249
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,189
uh you want the the stone on the right
side because i think it's gonna

250
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
side because i think it's gonna
 

251
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,430
side because i think it's gonna
go lopsided to the left here because of

252
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
go lopsided to the left here because of
 

253
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,030
go lopsided to the left here because of
this we'll see let's see what happens

254
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
this we'll see let's see what happens
 

255
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,990
this we'll see let's see what happens
to see if we can get the tree to grow oh

256
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
to see if we can get the tree to grow oh
 

257
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,670
to see if we can get the tree to grow oh
maybe not

258
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
maybe not
 

259
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,590
maybe not
uh yeah it's it kind of looks heavier to

260
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
uh yeah it's it kind of looks heavier to
 

261
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,590
uh yeah it's it kind of looks heavier to
the left doesn't it than the right side

262
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
the left doesn't it than the right side
 

263
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,189
the left doesn't it than the right side
there's more leaves on the left side

264
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
there's more leaves on the left side
 

265
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,270
there's more leaves on the left side
so i'm going to grow a few of these all

266
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
so i'm going to grow a few of these all
 

267
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,070
so i'm going to grow a few of these all
the way down here

268
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080

 

269
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,150

all right guys so check it out here so

270
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
all right guys so check it out here so
 

271
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,990
all right guys so check it out here so
far this has been pretty low effort i

272
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
far this has been pretty low effort i
 

273
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,110
far this has been pretty low effort i
just put in a path

274
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
just put in a path
 

275
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,150
just put in a path
and grew some trees and that's it right

276
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
and grew some trees and that's it right
 

277
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,469
and grew some trees and that's it right
and already in my opinion it makes this

278
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
and already in my opinion it makes this
 

279
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,590
and already in my opinion it makes this
area look way

280
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
area look way
 

281
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,070
area look way
better than the grassland we had here

282
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
better than the grassland we had here
 

283
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,710
better than the grassland we had here
before was way more interesting right

284
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
before was way more interesting right
 

285
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,629
before was way more interesting right
uh but now that we got this the question

286
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
uh but now that we got this the question
 

287
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,230
uh but now that we got this the question
is how can we make it better

288
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
is how can we make it better
 

289
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,749
is how can we make it better
that's the question you always want to

290
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
that's the question you always want to
 

291
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,350
that's the question you always want to
ask yourself when you're building how

292
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
ask yourself when you're building how
 

293
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,029
ask yourself when you're building how
can you make it better

294
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
can you make it better
 

295
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,310
can you make it better
um not so sure i like how low the leaves

296
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
um not so sure i like how low the leaves
 

297
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,670
um not so sure i like how low the leaves
are here

298
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680

 

299
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,430

uh or am i being too picky i don't know

300
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
uh or am i being too picky i don't know
 

301
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,670
uh or am i being too picky i don't know
uh one thing we could do or try to do is

302
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
uh one thing we could do or try to do is
 

303
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,550
uh one thing we could do or try to do is
start making some droopy leaves

304
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
start making some droopy leaves
 

305
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,909
start making some droopy leaves
kind of make it look like that it's

306
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
kind of make it look like that it's
 

307
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,590
kind of make it look like that it's
hanging a bit more

308
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
hanging a bit more
 

309
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,749
hanging a bit more
could could make it a little bit better

310
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
could could make it a little bit better
 

311
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,110
could could make it a little bit better
also we could mix

312
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
also we could mix
 

313
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,029
also we could mix
in some other types of blocks here so we

314
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
in some other types of blocks here so we
 

315
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,790
in some other types of blocks here so we
have just green

316
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
have just green
 

317
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,749
have just green
green grass oak and we have the leaves

318
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
green grass oak and we have the leaves
 

319
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,230
green grass oak and we have the leaves
right let's mix in some coarse dirt too

320
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
right let's mix in some coarse dirt too
 

321
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,110
right let's mix in some coarse dirt too
see if that helps it any any bit so i

322
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
see if that helps it any any bit so i
 

323
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,629
see if that helps it any any bit so i
got some coarse dirt here i brought some

324
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
got some coarse dirt here i brought some
 

325
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,990
got some coarse dirt here i brought some
soul sand as well but i don't know if

soul sand as well but i don't know if
 

327
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:03,830
soul sand as well but i don't know if
we're gonna use that

328
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840

 

329

okay very cool guys so check it out i've
mixed in the coarse dirt around the

332
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
mixed in the coarse dirt around the
 

333
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,870
mixed in the coarse dirt around the
trees here

334
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
trees here
 

335
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,710
trees here
i started around the trees and then it

336
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
i started around the trees and then it
 

337
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,909
i started around the trees and then it
looked a little weird

338
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
looked a little weird
 

339
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,629
looked a little weird
to be honest so i decided to like mix

340
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
to be honest so i decided to like mix
 

341
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,230
to be honest so i decided to like mix
coarse dirt throughout this whole area a

342
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
coarse dirt throughout this whole area a
 

343
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,510
coarse dirt throughout this whole area a
little bit as well

344
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
little bit as well
 

345
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,710
little bit as well
and that helped it out a lot

346
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
and that helped it out a lot
 

347
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,469
and that helped it out a lot
then i added the droopy leaves a little

348
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
then i added the droopy leaves a little
 

349
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,550
then i added the droopy leaves a little
bit not in the middle

350
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
bit not in the middle
 

351
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,990
bit not in the middle
of the path but on the right and the

352
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
of the path but on the right and the
 

353
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,070
of the path but on the right and the
left of it so on the edges of the trees

354
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
left of it so on the edges of the trees
 

355
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,629
left of it so on the edges of the trees
here

356
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
here
 

357
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,909
here
kind of makes it feel like the leaves

358
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
kind of makes it feel like the leaves
 

359
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,070
kind of makes it feel like the leaves
are hugging you you know and closes

360
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
are hugging you you know and closes
 

361
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,950
are hugging you you know and closes
closes you in a bit more and uh it was

362
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
closes you in a bit more and uh it was
 

363
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,309
closes you in a bit more and uh it was
pretty dark at night so i added some

364
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
pretty dark at night so i added some
 

365
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,749
pretty dark at night so i added some
hanging lamps here

366
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
hanging lamps here
 

367
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,309
hanging lamps here
staggered them of course so uh we got

368
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
staggered them of course so uh we got
 

369
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,670
staggered them of course so uh we got
one on the right

370
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
one on the right
 

371
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,110
one on the right
then one on the left one on the right

372
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
then one on the left one on the right
 

373
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,590
then one on the left one on the right
one on the left uh halfway through so

374
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
one on the left uh halfway through so
 

375
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,909
one on the left uh halfway through so
it it lights up a bigger area that way

376
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
it it lights up a bigger area that way
 

377
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,510
it it lights up a bigger area that way
with fewer lamps

378
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
with fewer lamps
 

379
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,309
with fewer lamps
and now i'm not sure what should we do

380
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
and now i'm not sure what should we do
 

381
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,029
and now i'm not sure what should we do
should we move on

382
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
should we move on
 

383
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,469
should we move on
i wanted to try we might want to add

i wanted to try we might want to add
 

385
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,870
i wanted to try we might want to add
more to the bottom of these

386
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
more to the bottom of these
 

387
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,070
more to the bottom of these

and just added a couple logs at the
 

427
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,270
and just added a couple logs at the
bottom not not a crazy amount

428
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
bottom not not a crazy amount
 

429
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,869

it looked a little weird hanging the
 

437
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,629
it looked a little weird hanging the
lighting from leaves so i added some

lighting from leaves so i added some
 

439
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,589
lighting from leaves so i added some
logs above

440
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
logs above
 

441
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,869
logs above
each of these fake ropes you know

442
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
each of these fake ropes you know
 

443
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,950
each of these fake ropes you know
and the last last little bit of detail

444

and the last last little bit of detail
 

445
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,230
and the last last little bit of detail
we might do here is

446
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
we might do here is
 

447
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,550
we might do here is
add just some some leaves at the bottom

448

add just some some leaves at the bottom
 

449

top of these
probably going to put some slabs either

498
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
probably going to put some slabs either
 

499
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,790

501
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,030
that color or
this color that way we don't get any

502
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
this color that way we don't get any
 

503
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,470
this color that way we don't get any

hmm actually you know what
 

509
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,590
hmm actually you know what
uh if we just do a fence like this

510
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
uh if we just do a fence like this
 

511
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,310
uh if we just do a fence like this
the whole way it's gonna be a big pile

512
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
the whole way it's gonna be a big pile
 

513
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,910
the whole way it's gonna be a big pile
of brown

514
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
of brown
 

515
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,790
of brown
uh definitely like the spruce more by

516
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
uh definitely like the spruce more by
 

517
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,509
uh definitely like the spruce more by
the way

518
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
the way
 

519
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,750
the way
so i i'm thinking we should also include

520
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
so i i'm thinking we should also include
 

521
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,430
so i i'm thinking we should also include
fences every now and then between them

522
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
fences every now and then between them
 

523
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,230
fences every now and then between them
so you can see

524
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
so you can see
 

525
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,630
so you can see
into the village get a little bit of

that'll help the look of the area quite

558
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
that'll help the look of the area quite
 

559
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,990
that'll help the look of the area quite
a bit it looks good on the inside too

560
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
a bit it looks good on the inside too
 

561
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,150
a bit it looks good on the inside too
it's it's basically the same thing

it's it's basically the same thing
 

563
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,990
it's it's basically the same thing
uh and it's a simple pattern didn't take

564
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
uh and it's a simple pattern didn't take
 

565
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,350
uh and it's a simple pattern didn't take
too long to do

566
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
too long to do
 

567
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,350
too long to do
so what i decided to do is just two or

so what i decided to do is just two or
three blocks tall for the wood parts

570
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
three blocks tall for the wood parts
 

571

and either one or two blocks wide for
the the fence parts

576

the the fence parts
 

577
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,630
the the fence parts
and it kind of staggers back and forth

578
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
and it kind of staggers back and forth
 

579
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,870
and it kind of staggers back and forth
as we go here

580
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
as we go here
 

581

626
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839

 

627
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,590

what is that from oh right over here

628
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
what is that from oh right over here
 

629
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,269
what is that from oh right over here
really

630
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
really
 

631
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,630
really

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
did not know that was there careful
 

633
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,630
did not know that was there careful
careful oh looks like i might have

634
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
careful oh looks like i might have
 

635
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,630
careful oh looks like i might have
actually gone into here before

636
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
actually gone into here before
 

637
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,910
actually gone into here before
redstone okay there is redstone

638
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
redstone okay there is redstone
 

639
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,590
redstone okay there is redstone
everywhere in this world isn't there

640
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600

 

641
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,910

so i put some coarse dirt on the bottom

642
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
so i put some coarse dirt on the bottom
 

643
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,069
so i put some coarse dirt on the bottom
here just so there'll be a little bit

644
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
here just so there'll be a little bit
 

645
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,829
here just so there'll be a little bit
more texture once all this grass

646
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
more texture once all this grass
 

647
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,910
more texture once all this grass
turns to dirt so it'll be a mix of the

648
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
turns to dirt so it'll be a mix of the
 

649
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,829
turns to dirt so it'll be a mix of the
two i don't know if it's really going to

650
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
two i don't know if it's really going to
 

651
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,030
two i don't know if it's really going to
be obvious

652
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
be obvious
 

653
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,310
be obvious
you can't really see through water

654
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
you can't really see through water
 

655
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,430
you can't really see through water
anyway but just in case

656
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
anyway but just in case
 

657
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,350
anyway but just in case
aha so you can kind of see the coarse

658
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
aha so you can kind of see the coarse
 

659
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,030
aha so you can kind of see the coarse
dirts maybe a little bit

660
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
dirts maybe a little bit
 

661
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,350
dirts maybe a little bit
kind of possibly when you're in the

662
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
kind of possibly when you're in the
 

663
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,990
kind of possibly when you're in the
water at least not not from above

664
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
water at least not not from above
 

665
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,870
water at least not not from above
yeah that was kind of pointless anyways

666
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
yeah that was kind of pointless anyways
 

667
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,670
yeah that was kind of pointless anyways
we got our little

668
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
we got our little
 

669
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,870
we got our little
uh dugout over here and we have the path

670
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
uh dugout over here and we have the path
 

671
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,310
uh dugout over here and we have the path
running right next to it

672
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
running right next to it
 

673
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,670
running right next to it
which is a big no-no uh in order to make

674
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
which is a big no-no uh in order to make
 

675
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,269
which is a big no-no uh in order to make
it look maybe a little bit more

676
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
it look maybe a little bit more
 

677
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,670
it look maybe a little bit more
realistic we want to fortify the path

678
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
realistic we want to fortify the path
 

679
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,949
realistic we want to fortify the path
with something maybe would

680
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
with something maybe would
 

681
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,990
with something maybe would
we'll try some wood here kind of run

682
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
we'll try some wood here kind of run
 

683
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,430
we'll try some wood here kind of run
that along

684
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
that along
 

685
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,629
that along
see what that looks like in just a

686
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
see what that looks like in just a
 

687
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,350
see what that looks like in just a
second but also i want to show you this

688
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
second but also i want to show you this
 

689
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,910
second but also i want to show you this
so those mushrooms are spreading quite a

690
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
so those mushrooms are spreading quite a
 

691
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,629
so those mushrooms are spreading quite a
bit a little bit more than i would like

692
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
bit a little bit more than i would like
 

693
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,230
bit a little bit more than i would like
like we don't want them on the path this

694
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
like we don't want them on the path this
 

695
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,190
like we don't want them on the path this
doesn't look very good right

696
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
doesn't look very good right
 

697
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,629
doesn't look very good right
so here's what we're going to do this is

698
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
so here's what we're going to do this is
 

699
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,150
so here's what we're going to do this is
a little trick for you guys in case

700
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
a little trick for you guys in case
 

701
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,949
a little trick for you guys in case
you've ever had this problem too

702
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
you've ever had this problem too
 

703
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,590
you've ever had this problem too
mushrooms check a nine by nine by three

704
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
mushrooms check a nine by nine by three
 

705
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,790
mushrooms check a nine by nine by three
area

706
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
area
 

707
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,949
area
if there's any more of the same type of

708
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
if there's any more of the same type of
 

709
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,990
if there's any more of the same type of
mushroom in that

710
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
mushroom in that
 

711
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,470
mushroom in that
if there's less than five then it will

712
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
if there's less than five then it will
 

713
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,750
if there's less than five then it will
spread

714
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
spread
 

715
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,509
spread
okay so basically it takes four blocks

716
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
okay so basically it takes four blocks
 

717
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,870
okay so basically it takes four blocks
away from itself

718
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
away from itself
 

719
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,910
away from itself
one block above one block below so we

720
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
one block above one block below so we
 

721
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,949
one block above one block below so we
can hide some

722
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
can hide some
 

723
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,069
can hide some
some red mushrooms here probably get

724
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
some red mushrooms here probably get
 

725
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,350
some red mushrooms here probably get
them underneath

726
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
them underneath
 

727
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,110
them underneath
here for example we can hide two there

728
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
here for example we can hide two there
 

729
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,990
here for example we can hide two there
pretty easily maybe some under the tree

730
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
pretty easily maybe some under the tree
 

731
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,910
pretty easily maybe some under the tree
and if we do that it's going to stop it

732
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
and if we do that it's going to stop it
 

733
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,670
and if we do that it's going to stop it
from spreading and it won't go on the

734
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
from spreading and it won't go on the
 

735
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,670
from spreading and it won't go on the
path like it was there

736
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
path like it was there
 

737
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,949
path like it was there
yeah put a couple more over here

738
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
yeah put a couple more over here
 

739
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,150
yeah put a couple more over here
although wait a second

740
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
although wait a second
 

741
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,550
although wait a second
so this one's going to check if there's

742
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
so this one's going to check if there's
 

743
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,150
so this one's going to check if there's
if there's five within the area it'll go

744
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
if there's five within the area it'll go
 

745
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,269
if there's five within the area it'll go
one two three

746
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
one two three
 

747
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,470
one two three
four yeah that's still within range

748
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
four yeah that's still within range
 

749
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,230
four yeah that's still within range
secondly i think that'll work

750
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240

 

751
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,350

we have a crisis situation here people

752
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
we have a crisis situation here people
 

753
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,949
we have a crisis situation here people
it's a step up step down typical problem

754
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
it's a step up step down typical problem
 

755
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,990
it's a step up step down typical problem
we all face

756
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
we all face
 

757
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,230
we all face
how do we deal with it i don't know

758
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
how do we deal with it i don't know
 

759
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,670
how do we deal with it i don't know
now uh this is uh just a couple examples

760
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
now uh this is uh just a couple examples
 

761
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,150
now uh this is uh just a couple examples
of how i usually do step up step downs

762
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
of how i usually do step up step downs
 

763
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,990
of how i usually do step up step downs
i always use slabs i don't like using

764
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
i always use slabs i don't like using
 

765
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,509
i always use slabs i don't like using
stairs for these

766
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
stairs for these
 

767
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,189
stairs for these
slabs are a little bit more gradual i

768
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
slabs are a little bit more gradual i
 

769
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,790
slabs are a little bit more gradual i
find

770
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
find
 

771
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,389
find
young etho probably would have done

772
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
young etho probably would have done
 

773
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,150
young etho probably would have done
something like this or you just put the

774
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
something like this or you just put the
 

775
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,670
something like this or you just put the
slabs like that

776
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
slabs like that
 

777
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,350
slabs like that
i've kind of learned though i don't like

778
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
i've kind of learned though i don't like
 

779
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,990
i've kind of learned though i don't like
it when the edges

780
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
it when the edges
 

781
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,269
it when the edges
are next to op to air blocks like

782
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
are next to op to air blocks like
 

783
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,350
are next to op to air blocks like
i always want a block on the left and

784
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
i always want a block on the left and
 

785
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,590
i always want a block on the left and
right of those if possible

786
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
right of those if possible
 

787
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,350
right of those if possible
another rule i usually follow is i don't

788
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
another rule i usually follow is i don't
 

789
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,590
another rule i usually follow is i don't
like to make a u-shape

790
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
like to make a u-shape
 

791
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,389
like to make a u-shape
when doing a step up step down if i can

792
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
when doing a step up step down if i can
 

793
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,430
when doing a step up step down if i can
help it

794
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
help it
 

795
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,310
help it
so in this case what would i do that's a

796
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
so in this case what would i do that's a
 

797
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,150
so in this case what would i do that's a
question for you

798
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
question for you
 

799
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,189
question for you
i think i would

800
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199

 

801
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,990

go in another block here at least and

802
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
go in another block here at least and
 

803
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,670
go in another block here at least and
like then you can do that you also don't

804
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
like then you can do that you also don't
 

805
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,030
like then you can do that you also don't
want it to be straight

806
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
want it to be straight
 

807
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,870
want it to be straight
straight is boring you want it to look

808
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
straight is boring you want it to look
 

809
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,110
straight is boring you want it to look
uh organic so probably

810
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
uh organic so probably
 

811
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,310
uh organic so probably
probably go like this switch this over

812
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
probably go like this switch this over
 

813
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,990
probably go like this switch this over
to gravel

814
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
to gravel
 

815
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,310
to gravel
there step up step down we got it

816
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
there step up step down we got it
 

817
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,470
there step up step down we got it
all right so this is another interesting

818
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
all right so this is another interesting
 

819
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,550
all right so this is another interesting
thing i did not expect to happen

820
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
thing i did not expect to happen
 

821
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,230
thing i did not expect to happen
uh so i put some slabs along the side

822
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
uh so i put some slabs along the side
 

823
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,150
uh so i put some slabs along the side
here this doesn't look right

824
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
here this doesn't look right
 

825
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,470
here this doesn't look right
right you know why it doesn't look right

826
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
right you know why it doesn't look right
 

827
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,710
right you know why it doesn't look right
it's because our eyes like to detect

828
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
it's because our eyes like to detect
 

829
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,150
it's because our eyes like to detect
patterns and we have an offset pattern

830
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
patterns and we have an offset pattern
 

831
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,910
patterns and we have an offset pattern
here we have grass on the right side

832
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
here we have grass on the right side
 

833
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,790
here we have grass on the right side
none on the left side um so it looks

834
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
none on the left side um so it looks
 

835
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,590
none on the left side um so it looks
weird

836
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
weird
 

837
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,069
weird
right i need to get at least one block

838
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
right i need to get at least one block
 

839
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,430
right i need to get at least one block
of grass on this

840
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
of grass on this
 

841
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,189
of grass on this
left side here for it to look okay um

842
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
left side here for it to look okay um
 

843
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,310
left side here for it to look okay um
also if we look over here i don't

844
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
also if we look over here i don't
 

845
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,629
also if we look over here i don't
like the oak wood at all we should use

846
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
like the oak wood at all we should use
 

847
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,829
like the oak wood at all we should use
the dark oak

848
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
the dark oak
 

849
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,430
the dark oak
hmm

850
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
hmm
 

851
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,590
hmm
still doesn't look quite right does it

852
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
still doesn't look quite right does it
 

853
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,030
still doesn't look quite right does it
something is off

854
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
something is off
 

855
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,790
something is off
it looks better i would say it looks

856
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
it looks better i would say it looks
 

857
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,910
it looks better i would say it looks
better i tried it with the slabs that

858
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
better i tried it with the slabs that
 

859
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150
better i tried it with the slabs that
doesn't look very good i tried it with

860
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
doesn't look very good i tried it with
 

861
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,189
doesn't look very good i tried it with
fences here

862
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
fences here
 

863
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,189
fences here
looks better with the fences but again

864
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
looks better with the fences but again
 

865
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,189
looks better with the fences but again
it still doesn't look quite

866
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
it still doesn't look quite
 

867
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,790
it still doesn't look quite
quite good uh possibly we need to

868
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
quite good uh possibly we need to
 

869
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,790
quite good uh possibly we need to
mirror what we did on this side to this

870
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
mirror what we did on this side to this
 

871
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,629
mirror what we did on this side to this
side

872
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
side
 

873
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,949
side
also i think the path is just wrong

874
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
also i think the path is just wrong
 

875
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,870
also i think the path is just wrong
yeah yeah let's uh let's shave off the

876
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
yeah yeah let's uh let's shave off the
 

877
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,910
yeah yeah let's uh let's shave off the
gravel over here

878
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
gravel over here
 

879
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,189
gravel over here
a little bit add it to over here we want

880
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
a little bit add it to over here we want
 

881
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,030
a little bit add it to over here we want
it to look like it's winding and it's

882
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
it to look like it's winding and it's
 

883
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,629
it to look like it's winding and it's
just a little bit crazy looking at the

884
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
just a little bit crazy looking at the
 

885
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,350
just a little bit crazy looking at the
moment no it's still no good

886
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
moment no it's still no good
 

887
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,150
moment no it's still no good
um let's try a little bit more

888
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160

 

889
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,189

push it over here oh and we got some

890
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
push it over here oh and we got some
 

891
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,470
push it over here oh and we got some
other problems

892
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
other problems
 

893
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,870
other problems
okay fill us in

894
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
okay fill us in
 

895
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,189
okay fill us in
again a lot of trial and error just

896
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
again a lot of trial and error just
 

897
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,110
again a lot of trial and error just
seeing if things work or not

898
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
seeing if things work or not
 

899
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,389
seeing if things work or not
i think it's getting better problem is

900
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
i think it's getting better problem is
 

901
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,350
i think it's getting better problem is
it's only two blocks wide there now

902
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
it's only two blocks wide there now
 

903
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,749
it's only two blocks wide there now
ah no it's not working

904
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759

 

905
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,069

and there we go so a little bit of trial

906
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
and there we go so a little bit of trial
 

907
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,269
and there we go so a little bit of trial
and error i think that looks a lot

908
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
and error i think that looks a lot
 

909
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,829
and error i think that looks a lot
better now though

910
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
better now though
 

911
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,870
better now though
hopefully please agree with me

912
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
hopefully please agree with me
 

913
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,230
hopefully please agree with me
uh yeah so i had a zig and then we had a

914
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
uh yeah so i had a zig and then we had a
 

915
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,789
uh yeah so i had a zig and then we had a
zag

916
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
zag
 

917
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,870
zag
and then we had a zig and then we had a

918
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
and then we had a zig and then we had a
 

919
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,429
and then we had a zig and then we had a
zag i got rid of the

920
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
zag i got rid of the
 

921
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,750
zag i got rid of the
zigzag zigzag and now we just have one

922
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
zigzag zigzag and now we just have one
 

923
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,789
zigzag zigzag and now we just have one
big zig

924
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
big zig
 

925
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,270
big zig
and a little zag that's the plan and

926
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
and a little zag that's the plan and
 

927
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,429
and a little zag that's the plan and
after i did that it went a lot better

928
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
after i did that it went a lot better
 

929
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,590
after i did that it went a lot better
so we'll take this out uh-huh

930
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
so we'll take this out uh-huh
 

931
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,070
so we'll take this out uh-huh
also to add the bounce to the pattern

932
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
also to add the bounce to the pattern
 

933
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,669
also to add the bounce to the pattern
like we talked about before we also have

934
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
like we talked about before we also have
 

935
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:31,990
like we talked about before we also have
to add

936
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
to add
 

937
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,990
to add
leaves and we have to add coarse dirt to

938
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
leaves and we have to add coarse dirt to
 

939
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,430
leaves and we have to add coarse dirt to
this other side

940
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
this other side
 

941
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,710
this other side
in order for it to to really feel right

942
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
in order for it to to really feel right
 

943
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,630
in order for it to to really feel right
so i want to put that over here maybe

944
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
so i want to put that over here maybe
 

945
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,990
so i want to put that over here maybe
get some leaves and yeah you get the

946
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
get some leaves and yeah you get the
 

947
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,950
get some leaves and yeah you get the
idea

948
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
idea
 

949
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,549
idea
all right let's take a look from over

950
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
all right let's take a look from over
 

951
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,470
all right let's take a look from over
here

952
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
here
 

953
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,150
here
how's it looking now all right that's

954
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
how's it looking now all right that's
 

955
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,470
how's it looking now all right that's
not

956
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
not
 

957
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,830
not
terrible i can live with not terrible

958
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840
terrible i can live with not terrible
 

959
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,669
terrible i can live with not terrible
right

960
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
right
 

961
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,350
right
uh yeah i think what i'll do

962
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
uh yeah i think what i'll do
 

963
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,990

965
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,029
yeah let's let's do this uh we're gonna
build up the terrain a little bit here

966
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
build up the terrain a little bit here
 

967
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,110
build up the terrain a little bit here
all the way around and then make it

968
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
all the way around and then make it
 

969
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,150
all the way around and then make it
connect to

970
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
connect to
 

971
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,590
connect to
over here ah darn it

972
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
over here ah darn it
 

973
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,669
over here ah darn it
ah i still have a button of milk though

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840

 

977
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,230

well there we go guys so we bounced out

978
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
well there we go guys so we bounced out
 

979
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,070
well there we go guys so we bounced out
our pattern here we got all this garbage

980
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
our pattern here we got all this garbage
 

981
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,990
our pattern here we got all this garbage
on the left side as well

982
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
on the left side as well
 

983
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,710
on the left side as well
the leaves the grass coarse dirt and by

984
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
the leaves the grass coarse dirt and by
 

985
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,830
the leaves the grass coarse dirt and by
doing that it just

986
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
doing that it just
 

987
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,230
doing that it just
it looks a lot more pleasing right or at

988
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
it looks a lot more pleasing right or at
 

989
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,310
it looks a lot more pleasing right or at
least i think it does anyway

990
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
least i think it does anyway
 

991
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,230

you'll notice when i do this i start

1000
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
you'll notice when i do this i start
 

1001
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,150
you'll notice when i do this i start
with the gravel first like the soft

1002
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
with the gravel first like the soft
 

1003
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,870
with the gravel first like the soft
material

1004
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
material
 

1005
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,710
material
or if i'm working with dirt and like

1006
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
or if i'm working with dirt and like
 

1007
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,070
or if i'm working with dirt and like
clay i'll start with the dirt

1008
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
clay i'll start with the dirt
 

1009
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,150
clay i'll start with the dirt
first you don't want to do cobblestone

1010
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
first you don't want to do cobblestone
 

1011
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,750
first you don't want to do cobblestone
and then add gravel because it takes

1012
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
and then add gravel because it takes
 

1013
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,990
and then add gravel because it takes
longer to break cobblestone

1014
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
longer to break cobblestone
 

1015
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,909
longer to break cobblestone
and it just goes quicker if you use the

1016
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
and it just goes quicker if you use the
 

1017
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,190
and it just goes quicker if you use the
soft material as your base instead

1018
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
soft material as your base instead
 

1019
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,430
soft material as your base instead
here's another really simple little

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,630
here's another really simple little
trick

1022
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
trick

trick
i'll share with you guys it's a pretty

1024
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
i'll share with you guys it's a pretty
 

1025
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,150
i'll share with you guys it's a pretty
common one

1026
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

if you have a plain plain jane old fence

1028
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
if you have a plain plain jane old fence
 

1029
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,150
if you have a plain plain jane old fence
like this

1030
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
like this
 

1031
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,150
like this
one way you can add more interest to it

1032
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
one way you can add more interest to it
 

1033
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,350
one way you can add more interest to it
is by

1034
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
is by
 

1035
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,430
is by
like every second block get rid of the

1036
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
like every second block get rid of the
 

1037
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,990
like every second block get rid of the
fence and put in the fence gates

1038
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
fence and put in the fence gates
 

1039
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,470
fence and put in the fence gates
and what that does is it has a slightly

1040
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
and what that does is it has a slightly
 

1041
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,510
and what that does is it has a slightly
different texture

1042
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
different texture
 

1043
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,750
different texture
and it doesn't connect at the bottom so

1044
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
and it doesn't connect at the bottom so
 

1045
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,270
and it doesn't connect at the bottom so
it looks like this fence here is

1046
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
it looks like this fence here is
 

1047
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,150
it looks like this fence here is
supporting it

1048
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
supporting it
 

1049
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,070
supporting it
and this is raised it's also nice

1050
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
and this is raised it's also nice
 

1051
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,350
and this is raised it's also nice
because you can

1052
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
because you can
 

1053
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,870
because you can
exit out wherever you want that way too

1054
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
exit out wherever you want that way too
 

1055
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,710
exit out wherever you want that way too
and you can see it pretty clearly here

1056
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
and you can see it pretty clearly here
 

1057
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,549
and you can see it pretty clearly here
too like it's a simple thing but it does

1058
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
too like it's a simple thing but it does
 

1059
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,710
too like it's a simple thing but it does
change the look of the fence quite a bit

1060
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
change the look of the fence quite a bit
 

1061
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,470
change the look of the fence quite a bit

now we want to bring this down kind of

1104
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
now we want to bring this down kind of
 

1105
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,990
now we want to bring this down kind of
a gentle slope down to here and then

1106
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
a gentle slope down to here and then
 

1107
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,870
a gentle slope down to here and then
connect to this i don't like this trot

1108
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
connect to this i don't like this trot
 

1109
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,149
connect to this i don't like this trot
and dirt i don't know what i was

1110
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
and dirt i don't know what i was
 

1111
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,430
and dirt i don't know what i was
thinking when i put it here

1112
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440

 

1113
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,909

i don't know but this is supposed to be

1114
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
i don't know but this is supposed to be
 

1115
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,510
i don't know but this is supposed to be
a path as well we'll probably have to

1116
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
a path as well we'll probably have to
 

1117
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,870
a path as well we'll probably have to
change that

1118
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
change that
 

1119
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,110
change that
and my plan originally was to dig a

1120
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
and my plan originally was to dig a
 

1121
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,870
and my plan originally was to dig a
tunnel through this hill

1122
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
tunnel through this hill
 

1123
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,230
tunnel through this hill
so we'll have a path going through a

1124
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
so we'll have a path going through a
 

1125
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,789
so we'll have a path going through a
tunnel which should look pretty cool i

1126
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
tunnel which should look pretty cool i
 

1127
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,710
tunnel which should look pretty cool i
love tunnels

1128
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
love tunnels
 

1129
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,590
love tunnels
go through the to the other side here

1130
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
go through the to the other side here
 

1131
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,230
go through the to the other side here
and

1132
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
and
 

1133
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,909
and
eventually we might get around to

1134
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
eventually we might get around to
 

1135
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,549
eventually we might get around to
building a path through this area too

1136
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
building a path through this area too
 

1137
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,950
building a path through this area too
which will hopefully connect to a

1138
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
which will hopefully connect to a
 

1139
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,350
which will hopefully connect to a
village we build over here

1140
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
village we build over here
