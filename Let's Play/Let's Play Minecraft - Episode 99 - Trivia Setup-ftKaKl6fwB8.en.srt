00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,060

alright guys so today I kind of wanted

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,070
alright guys so today I kind of wanted
 

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,560
alright guys so today I kind of wanted
to start working on that trivia game

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,570
to start working on that trivia game
 

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,780
to start working on that trivia game
idea we had and I think I found a

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:14,790
idea we had and I think I found a
 

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,340
idea we had and I think I found a
location for it that'll work out pretty

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,350
location for it that'll work out pretty
 

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,540
location for it that'll work out pretty
good

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,550
good
 

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,640
good
so our first base is over there so we're

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,650
so our first base is over there so we're
 

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,040
so our first base is over there so we're
close to that I wanted to pick a

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,050
close to that I wanted to pick a
 

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,660
close to that I wanted to pick a
location that would be easy for you to

16
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,670
location that would be easy for you to
 

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,480
location that would be easy for you to
find because this is mostly intended for

18
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:29,490
find because this is mostly intended for
 

19
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,429
find because this is mostly intended for
you guys something fun for you to do if

20
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
you guys something fun for you to do if
 

21
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,459
you guys something fun for you to do if
you download my world and this is the

22
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:34,469
you download my world and this is the
 

23
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,430
you download my world and this is the
spot I found it's just off the ocean

24
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
spot I found it's just off the ocean
 

25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,139
spot I found it's just off the ocean
here to the right you'll be able to see

26
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:39,149
here to the right you'll be able to see
 

27
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,900
here to the right you'll be able to see
it if you're going by pretty easy and

28
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:41,910
it if you're going by pretty easy and
 

29
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,610
it if you're going by pretty easy and
we're close to zero zero so pretty sure

30
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:46,620
we're close to zero zero so pretty sure
 

31
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,229
we're close to zero zero so pretty sure
you'll be able to find it yeah it's

32
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:51,239
you'll be able to find it yeah it's
 

33
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,910
you'll be able to find it yeah it's
gonna build it over here I think it's

34
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
gonna build it over here I think it's
 

35
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,430
gonna build it over here I think it's
far enough away from our first base

36
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
far enough away from our first base
 

37
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,310
far enough away from our first base
there that shouldn't be any leg issues

38
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
there that shouldn't be any leg issues
 

39
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,240
there that shouldn't be any leg issues
with redstone and that I hope I hope you

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,250
with redstone and that I hope I hope you
 

41
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,630
with redstone and that I hope I hope you
never know and yeah it's gonna build it

42
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:05,640
never know and yeah it's gonna build it
 

43
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,490
never know and yeah it's gonna build it
here I'm thinking kind of having a log

44
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
here I'm thinking kind of having a log
 

45
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,140
here I'm thinking kind of having a log
cabin style thing and maybe it dock for

46
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,150
cabin style thing and maybe it dock for
 

47
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,990
cabin style thing and maybe it dock for
the ocean boat dock that type of stuff

48
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
the ocean boat dock that type of stuff
 

49
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,410
the ocean boat dock that type of stuff
but I'll worry about the redstone stuff

50
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
but I'll worry about the redstone stuff
 

51
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,060
but I'll worry about the redstone stuff
first and then we'll put a building

52
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,070
first and then we'll put a building
 

53
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,940
first and then we'll put a building
around it after and this is a spot I

54
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:22,950
around it after and this is a spot I
 

55
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,940
around it after and this is a spot I
thinking I'll have our question board in

56
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:25,950
thinking I'll have our question board in
 

57
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,670
thinking I'll have our question board in
front of us I'll have to remove a lot of

58
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
front of us I'll have to remove a lot of
 

59
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,050
front of us I'll have to remove a lot of
this soil here but it's not it it's not

60
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,060
this soil here but it's not it it's not
 

61
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,550
this soil here but it's not it it's not
gonna be too bad the main reason I want

62
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
gonna be too bad the main reason I want
 

63
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,510
gonna be too bad the main reason I want
to build it here is because we've got

64
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
to build it here is because we've got
 

65
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,910
to build it here is because we've got
this hillside in the back and I don't

66
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
this hillside in the back and I don't
 

67
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,560
this hillside in the back and I don't
know how much space I'll need for the

68
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,570
know how much space I'll need for the
 

69
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,390
know how much space I'll need for the
redstone wiring and all that so if I

70
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,400
redstone wiring and all that so if I
 

71
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,630
redstone wiring and all that so if I
need more I can just build it into the

72
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
need more I can just build it into the
 

73
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,210
need more I can just build it into the
hill and it will be nicely hidden out of

74
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,220
hill and it will be nicely hidden out of
 

75
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,450
hill and it will be nicely hidden out of
sight so should be good should be good I

76
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,460
sight so should be good should be good I
 

77
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,440
sight so should be good should be good I
hope so I'll start working on it and I

78
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,450
hope so I'll start working on it and I
 

79
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,910
hope so I'll start working on it and I
will see you shortly

80
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
will see you shortly
 

81
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,109
will see you shortly
I got a bit of the hillside clear away

82
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
I got a bit of the hillside clear away
 

83
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,030
I got a bit of the hillside clear away
now just enough to allow us to get

84
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040
now just enough to allow us to get
 

85
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,770
now just enough to allow us to get
started here we'll probably have to

86
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:03,780
started here we'll probably have to
 

87
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,280
started here we'll probably have to
clear more eventually but I just wanted

88
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,290
clear more eventually but I just wanted
 

89
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,690
clear more eventually but I just wanted
they be able to put down our panel here

90
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:10,700
they be able to put down our panel here
 

91
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,500
they be able to put down our panel here
this is the quest

92
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,510
this is the quest
 

93
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,170
this is the quest
and panel so on the first row here will

94
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,180
and panel so on the first row here will
 

95
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,420
and panel so on the first row here will
have a glowstone indicator light to show

96
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,430
have a glowstone indicator light to show
 

97
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,780
have a glowstone indicator light to show
us which question we are on could be 11

98
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:23,790
us which question we are on could be 11
 

99
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,990
us which question we are on could be 11
questions total then this first set of

100
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,000
questions total then this first set of
 

101
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,300
questions total then this first set of
signs all the way long is the questions

102
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,310
signs all the way long is the questions
 

103
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,610
signs all the way long is the questions
all 11 questions below that is the ABCD

104
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:34,620
all 11 questions below that is the ABCD
 

105
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,220
all 11 questions below that is the ABCD
possible choices possible answers to the

106
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,230
possible choices possible answers to the
 

107
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:46,430
possible choices possible answers to the
questions and then finally finally we

108
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:46,440
questions and then finally finally we
 

109
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,460
questions and then finally finally we
have something that was highly requested

110
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,470
have something that was highly requested
 

111
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,270
have something that was highly requested
or suggested I should say it's our spore

112
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
or suggested I should say it's our spore
 

113
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,629
or suggested I should say it's our spore
board it's not set up now of course

114
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:56,639
board it's not set up now of course
 

115
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,410
board it's not set up now of course
nothing's behind here yet but I did find

116
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,420
nothing's behind here yet but I did find
 

117
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,440
nothing's behind here yet but I did find
a way so that when you start the game

118
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,450
a way so that when you start the game
 

119
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,360
a way so that when you start the game
all these lights will be off all these

120
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,370
all these lights will be off all these
 

121
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,809
all these lights will be off all these
redstone torches and if you get a

122
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:08,819
redstone torches and if you get a
 

123
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,319
redstone torches and if you get a
question wrong they'll stay off but if

124
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,329
question wrong they'll stay off but if
 

125
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,020
question wrong they'll stay off but if
you get a question right they'll come on

126
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,030
you get a question right they'll come on
 

127
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,259
you get a question right they'll come on
so if you a question one right two wrong

128
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:18,269
so if you a question one right two wrong
 

129
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,189
so if you a question one right two wrong
three right

130
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:19,199
three right
 

131
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,270
three right
it'll be on off on and the rest will be

132
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
it'll be on off on and the rest will be
 

133
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,979
it'll be on off on and the rest will be
off until you go through them so

134
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:26,989
off until you go through them so
 

135
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,759
off until you go through them so
normally to do that I'll be like

136
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:30,769
normally to do that I'll be like
 

137
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,960
normally to do that I'll be like
normally to do that you would need a

138
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:32,970
normally to do that you would need a
 

139
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,930
normally to do that you would need a
bunch of T flip-flops and it would be

140
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:35,940
bunch of T flip-flops and it would be
 

141
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,869
bunch of T flip-flops and it would be
very difficult to get them that close

142
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
very difficult to get them that close
 

143
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,610
very difficult to get them that close
together like all these indicator lights

144
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
together like all these indicator lights
 

145
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,729
together like all these indicator lights
together like this but I found a pretty

146
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:43,739
together like this but I found a pretty
 

147
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,710
together like this but I found a pretty
good way of doing it with using pistons

148
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,720
good way of doing it with using pistons
 

149
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,979
good way of doing it with using pistons
and I will show you that shortly the

150
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:48,989
and I will show you that shortly the
 

151
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,110
and I will show you that shortly the
very first thing I'm going to do is this

152
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
very first thing I'm going to do is this
 

153
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,780
very first thing I'm going to do is this
scoreboard here the second thing I'll

154
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:53,790
scoreboard here the second thing I'll
 

155
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,349
scoreboard here the second thing I'll
probably do is a glowstone thing above

156
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:57,359
probably do is a glowstone thing above
 

157
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,990
probably do is a glowstone thing above
there I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna

158
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
there I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna
 

159
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,819
there I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna
do another scoreboard like one that

160
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:01,829
do another scoreboard like one that
 

161
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,000
do another scoreboard like one that
keeps track of your losses and wins

162
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,010
keeps track of your losses and wins
 

163
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,210
keeps track of your losses and wins
vertically maybe but I haven't found a

164
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,220
vertically maybe but I haven't found a
 

165
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,110
vertically maybe but I haven't found a
good way of doing that yet and that's

166
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,120
good way of doing that yet and that's
 

167
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,439
good way of doing that yet and that's
the progress so far and of course I did

168
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:15,449
the progress so far and of course I did
 

169
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,259
the progress so far and of course I did
use sandstone again for the border here

170
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:18,269
use sandstone again for the border here
 

171
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,529
use sandstone again for the border here
I think it looks good dark wood in the

172
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:21,539
I think it looks good dark wood in the
 

173
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,720
I think it looks good dark wood in the
back

174
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,730

 

175
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,730

I kind of suggested either dark wood

176
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:26,740
I kind of suggested either dark wood
 

177
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,290
I kind of suggested either dark wood
black wool or glowstone for the back and

178
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,300
black wool or glowstone for the back and
 

179
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,740
black wool or glowstone for the back and
most people seem to prefer dark wood and

180
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:33,750
most people seem to prefer dark wood and
 

181
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,660
most people seem to prefer dark wood and
definitely don't use glow stone black

182
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:36,670
definitely don't use glow stone black
 

183
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,060
definitely don't use glow stone black
was a possibility but more people said

184
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,070
was a possibility but more people said
 

185
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,330
was a possibility but more people said
dark wood so that's what I used and I

186
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,340
dark wood so that's what I used and I
 

187
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,150
dark wood so that's what I used and I
think the sandstone looks good with it

188
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,160
think the sandstone looks good with it
 

189
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,580
think the sandstone looks good with it
but I'm no expert and the dark wood

190
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:50,590
but I'm no expert and the dark wood
 

191
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,470
but I'm no expert and the dark wood
should match the rest of the building

192
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,480
should match the rest of the building
 

193
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,090
should match the rest of the building
we're gonna make here since I'm thinking

194
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,100
we're gonna make here since I'm thinking
 

195
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,630
we're gonna make here since I'm thinking
log cabin should work out pretty good

196
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,640
log cabin should work out pretty good
 

197
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,440
log cabin should work out pretty good
so I'm going to start working on this

198
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,450
so I'm going to start working on this
 

199
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:08,090
so I'm going to start working on this
poor display and I will see you shortly

200
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,100

 

201
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,830

so I had the score display about half

202
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:10,840
so I had the score display about half
 

203
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,690
so I had the score display about half
done now I wanted to show it to you guys

204
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:12,700
done now I wanted to show it to you guys
 

205
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,640
done now I wanted to show it to you guys
before I finished it up so that you

206
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,650
before I finished it up so that you
 

207
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,610
before I finished it up so that you
could see how it works easily right now

208
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:17,620
could see how it works easily right now
 

209
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,470
could see how it works easily right now
you will see these torches are all off

210
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,480
you will see these torches are all off
 

211
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,890
you will see these torches are all off
by default now and this here is my

212
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:22,900
by default now and this here is my
 

213
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,600
by default now and this here is my
memory unit system I built pretty happy

214
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,610
memory unit system I built pretty happy
 

215
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,580
memory unit system I built pretty happy
with how this works

216
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,590
with how this works
 

217
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,580
with how this works
we got Pistons underneath all these wood

218
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,590
we got Pistons underneath all these wood
 

219
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,290
we got Pistons underneath all these wood
blocks they're facing up sticky pistons

220
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300

 

221
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,480

just have these buttons here temporarily

222
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,490

 

223
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,550

so normally these blocks go up and then

224
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
so normally these blocks go up and then
 

225
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
so normally these blocks go up and then
down and they retract but if this is

226
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:46,810
down and they retract but if this is
 

227
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,260
down and they retract but if this is
powered this wire here it sends power to

228
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,270
powered this wire here it sends power to
 

229
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,770
powered this wire here it sends power to
all these repeaters and so when you hit

230
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:52,780
all these repeaters and so when you hit
 

231
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,960
all these repeaters and so when you hit
a button the block goes up but it stays

232
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:00,970
a button the block goes up but it stays
 

233
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,809
a button the block goes up but it stays
up it doesn't retract back that's

234
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:03,819
up it doesn't retract back that's
 

235
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,909
up it doesn't retract back that's
because this for Peter sending power to

236
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
because this for Peter sending power to
 

237
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,610
because this for Peter sending power to
the wood block which then sends power

238
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:08,620
the wood block which then sends power
 

239
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,649
the wood block which then sends power
down into the piston so it's being

240
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:10,659
down into the piston so it's being
 

241
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,249
down into the piston so it's being
powered so it won't retract and it also

242
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:14,259
powered so it won't retract and it also
 

243
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,959
powered so it won't retract and it also
sends power to the left here too this

244
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:15,969
sends power to the left here too this
 

245
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,409
sends power to the left here too this
repeater sends power to this block to

246
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:19,419
repeater sends power to this block to
 

247
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,559
repeater sends power to this block to
this torch up into this wood block and

248
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:22,569
this torch up into this wood block and
 

249
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,360
this torch up into this wood block and
on the other side is our score display

250
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,370
on the other side is our score display
 

251
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,189
on the other side is our score display
indicator lights which is now on so

252
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:32,199
indicator lights which is now on so
 

253
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:40,950
indicator lights which is now on so
that's pretty cool do that now we have

254
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
that's pretty cool do that now we have
 

255
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,019
that's pretty cool do that now we have
five blocks up and so those effectively

256
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:46,029
five blocks up and so those effectively
 

257
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,959
five blocks up and so those effectively
act as RS nor latch --is but they're

258
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:48,969
act as RS nor latch --is but they're
 

259
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,050
act as RS nor latch --is but they're
very you're able to build them very

260
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,060
very you're able to build them very
 

261
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,730
very you're able to build them very
compact together they're pretty simple

262
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:53,740
compact together they're pretty simple
 

263
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,899
compact together they're pretty simple
quick the build which is nice and then

264
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:57,909
quick the build which is nice and then
 

265
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,670
quick the build which is nice and then
when you're ready to reset them all I

266
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
when you're ready to reset them all I
 

267
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,760
when you're ready to reset them all I
have this master wire here if you

268
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:02,770
have this master wire here if you
 

269
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,909
have this master wire here if you
unpowered these repeaters this block

270
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
unpowered these repeaters this block
 

271
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,709
unpowered these repeaters this block
becomes unpowered and the Pistons are

272
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:07,719
becomes unpowered and the Pistons are
 

273
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,180
becomes unpowered and the Pistons are
able to retract so you would do that by

274
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,190
able to retract so you would do that by
 

275
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,369
able to retract so you would do that by
sending a pulse into this wire here like

276
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:17,379
sending a pulse into this wire here like
 

277
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,700
sending a pulse into this wire here like
that and that's how that works it's

278
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,710
that and that's how that works it's
 

279
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,740
that and that's how that works it's
pretty cool I'm gonna finish it up now

280
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,750
pretty cool I'm gonna finish it up now
 

281
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,450
pretty cool I'm gonna finish it up now

got our thing here which keeps track of
 

303
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,110
got our thing here which keeps track of
a question we're on so this thing is one

nine ten eleven blocks wide and we have

308
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,090
nine ten eleven blocks wide and we have
 

309
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,730
nine ten eleven blocks wide and we have
eleven questions so each one of these

310
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:06,740
eleven questions so each one of these
 

311
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,480
eleven questions so each one of these
blocks represents our question and the

312
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,490
blocks represents our question and the
 

313
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,520
blocks represents our question and the
wood block indicates what question we

314
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,530
wood block indicates what question we
 

315
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,930
wood block indicates what question we
are on so one two three four five six we

316
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:16,940
are on so one two three four five six we
 

317
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,800
are on so one two three four five six we
are on the sixth question right now if

318
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:19,810
are on the sixth question right now if
 

319
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,850
are on the sixth question right now if
we hit this if we if we got the question

320
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:24,860
we hit this if we if we got the question
 

321
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,460
we hit this if we if we got the question
right we would send a pulse to this wire

322
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:27,470
right we would send a pulse to this wire
 

323
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,589
right we would send a pulse to this wire
here I'll just press a button to make it

324
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
here I'll just press a button to make it
 

325
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,980
here I'll just press a button to make it
and you can see one two three four five

326
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:35,990
and you can see one two three four five
 

327
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,880
and you can see one two three four five
six our sixth question is correct now

328
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:38,890
six our sixth question is correct now
 

329
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:45,310
six our sixth question is correct now
and then it would move ahead to the next

330
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:45,320
and then it would move ahead to the next
 

331
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,480
and then it would move ahead to the next
question so we hit this one more time

332
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,490

 

333
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,010

you can see this is on the seventh one

334
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,020
you can see this is on the seventh one
 

335
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,160
you can see this is on the seventh one
now one two three four five six seven so

336
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,170
now one two three four five six seven so
 

337
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,410
now one two three four five six seven so
it moved ahead what this is doing

338
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,420
it moved ahead what this is doing
 

339
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,820
it moved ahead what this is doing
there's Pistons moving it to the right

340
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:02,830
there's Pistons moving it to the right
 

341
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,560
there's Pistons moving it to the right
then this one moves it down there's

342
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,570
then this one moves it down there's
 

343
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,970
then this one moves it down there's
another piston here moving it to the

344
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:06,980
another piston here moving it to the
 

345
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,980
another piston here moving it to the
left and below here is an exact copy of

346
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:10,990
left and below here is an exact copy of
 

347
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,810
left and below here is an exact copy of
this row above so we have ten glass

348
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:13,820
this row above so we have ten glass
 

349
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,340
this row above so we have ten glass
blocks and one wood block

350
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,350
blocks and one wood block
 

351
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,850
blocks and one wood block
so there's 22 blocks total and two wood

352
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:21,860
so there's 22 blocks total and two wood
 

353
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,390
so there's 22 blocks total and two wood
blocks in that so it's just just a copy

354
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:27,400
blocks in that so it's just just a copy
 

355
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,560
blocks in that so it's just just a copy
and yeah we have our thing above here

356
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,570

 

357
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,320

power goes here just like below we have

358
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,330
power goes here just like below we have
 

359
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,670
power goes here just like below we have
a thing that keeps track of what

360
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
a thing that keeps track of what
 

361
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,220
a thing that keeps track of what
question we're on this is just for

362
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,230
question we're on this is just for
 

363
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,550
question we're on this is just for
visual purposes this one up here I'll be

364
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:45,560
visual purposes this one up here I'll be
 

365
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,620
visual purposes this one up here I'll be
replacing the wood with glowstone when

366
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:47,630
replacing the wood with glowstone when
 

367
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,120
replacing the wood with glowstone when
this is done but it just tells us we are

368
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,130
this is done but it just tells us we are
 

369
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,740
this is done but it just tells us we are
on the seventh question because that's

370
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:53,750
on the seventh question because that's
 

371
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,800
on the seventh question because that's
where this soon-to-be closed stone block

372
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:56,810
where this soon-to-be closed stone block
 

373
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,009
where this soon-to-be closed stone block
is above all right

374
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:02,019

 

375
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,189

and so if we send a pulse to Swire this

376
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:05,199
and so if we send a pulse to Swire this
 

377
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,340
and so if we send a pulse to Swire this
is of the only blocks that power will

378
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,350
is of the only blocks that power will
 

379
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,049
is of the only blocks that power will
get sent through to our piston on the

380
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:10,059
get sent through to our piston on the
 

381
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:15,090
get sent through to our piston on the
other side which causes it to go up and

382
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,100
other side which causes it to go up and
 

383
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,729
other side which causes it to go up and
since this is being powered it stays up

384
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:17,739
since this is being powered it stays up
 

385
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,160
since this is being powered it stays up
and it causes power to go through to the

386
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,170
and it causes power to go through to the
 

387
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,549
and it causes power to go through to the
other side to our indicator light so

388
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:26,559
other side to our indicator light so
 

389
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,910
other side to our indicator light so
that's how that works and then when we

390
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
that's how that works and then when we
 

391
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,829
that's how that works and then when we
get to the end of all this when we

392
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
get to the end of all this when we
 

393
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,910
get to the end of all this when we
finish our last question here I will

394
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
finish our last question here I will
 

395
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,069
finish our last question here I will
have to send a pulse to this thing which

396
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
have to send a pulse to this thing which
 

397
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,369
have to send a pulse to this thing which
will clear it all and it will start

398
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:41,379
will clear it all and it will start
 

399
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,999
will clear it all and it will start
fresh again

400
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,009

 

401
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:51,600

so watts to it I believe the thing I was

402
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:51,610
so watts to it I believe the thing I was
 

403
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,069
so watts to it I believe the thing I was
having trouble with last when I was

404
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,079
having trouble with last when I was
 

405
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,229
having trouble with last when I was
working on this was this selector panel

406
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:55,239
working on this was this selector panel
 

407
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,819
working on this was this selector panel
and I never did figure out how he's

408
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:56,829
and I never did figure out how he's
 

409
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:01,039
and I never did figure out how he's
gonna do it

410
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,049

 

411
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,379

so this button here would be a B C D for

412
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:07,389
so this button here would be a B C D for
 

413
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:09,960
so this button here would be a B C D for
our ABCD answers to the question above

414
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:09,970
our ABCD answers to the question above
 

415
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,769
our ABCD answers to the question above
multiple choice I decide to have a gap

416
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:13,779
multiple choice I decide to have a gap
 

417
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:20,249
multiple choice I decide to have a gap
between a B and C D just to to make it

418
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:20,259
between a B and C D just to to make it
 

419
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,840
between a B and C D just to to make it
look more symmetrical because it's an

420
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:21,850
look more symmetrical because it's an
 

421
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,480
look more symmetrical because it's an
odd number of questions so need an odd

422
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,490
odd number of questions so need an odd
 

423
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,590
odd number of questions so need an odd
block in between the wiring though is

424
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
block in between the wiring though is
 

425
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,530
block in between the wiring though is
kind of from E to D so yeah I had a wire

426
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:34,540
kind of from E to D so yeah I had a wire
 

427
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,660
kind of from E to D so yeah I had a wire
below here any of these buttons you push

428
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:39,670
below here any of these buttons you push
 

429
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,309
below here any of these buttons you push
will light this wire up this is the

430
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:44,319
will light this wire up this is the
 

431
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,030
will light this wire up this is the
player made a choice wire and then we

432
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,040
player made a choice wire and then we
 

433
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,619
player made a choice wire and then we
need to separate each of the button

434
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:51,629
need to separate each of the button
 

435
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,689
need to separate each of the button
things as well so this button would go

436
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:54,699
things as well so this button would go
 

437
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,420
things as well so this button would go
left I think

438
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,430

 

439
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,180

it's that one as trying to trying to do

440
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,190
it's that one as trying to trying to do
 

441
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,070
it's that one as trying to trying to do
it without blocking the players view of

442
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,080
it without blocking the players view of
 

443
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,540
it without blocking the players view of
the board here which is very challenging

444
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:07,550
the board here which is very challenging
 

445
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,140
the board here which is very challenging
I could put a half slab over that no

446
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,150
I could put a half slab over that no
 

447
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,840
I could put a half slab over that no
problem then the problem is like it that

448
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:19,850
problem then the problem is like it that
 

449
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:25,860
problem then the problem is like it that
just doesn't doesn't look the best I

450
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:25,870
just doesn't doesn't look the best I
 

451
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,300
just doesn't doesn't look the best I
would have to put a full block here and

452
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,310
would have to put a full block here and
 

453
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:34,740
would have to put a full block here and
yes no I I can't it would cut the wire

454
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:34,750

 

455
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,720

and if I leave it open like that you can

456
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:37,730
and if I leave it open like that you can
 

457
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,690
and if I leave it open like that you can
see the wire from the side so I don't

458
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:40,700
see the wire from the side so I don't
 

459
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,000
see the wire from the side so I don't
know I'm not sure the best way of doing

460
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,010
know I'm not sure the best way of doing
 

461
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,360
know I'm not sure the best way of doing
these panels the selector panel would

462
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,370
these panels the selector panel would
 

463
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:58,090
these panels the selector panel would
you shut up thank you lamb chops

464
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,100
you shut up thank you lamb chops
 

465
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,990
you shut up thank you lamb chops
I wonder if notches adding lamb chops to

466
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,000
I wonder if notches adding lamb chops to
 

467
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,070
I wonder if notches adding lamb chops to
the game in 1.8 he's adding a whole

468
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,080
the game in 1.8 he's adding a whole
 

469
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,570
the game in 1.8 he's adding a whole
bunch of different kinds of meats like

470
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:10,580
bunch of different kinds of meats like
 

471
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,710
bunch of different kinds of meats like
chicken and that steak so maybe could go

472
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:17,720
chicken and that steak so maybe could go
 

473
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,330
chicken and that steak so maybe could go
for some lamb chops

474
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:21,340

 

475
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,480

yeah so I would have to have a block in

476
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,490
yeah so I would have to have a block in
 

477
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,450
yeah so I would have to have a block in
front here be covered I'd probably run

478
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,460
front here be covered I'd probably run
 

479
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,640
front here be covered I'd probably run
this wire

480
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:36,650

 

481
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,770

through here and make it go down there

482
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:41,780
through here and make it go down there
 

483
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,960
through here and make it go down there
somehow so to be fairly nicely covered

484
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:46,970
somehow so to be fairly nicely covered
 

485
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,970
somehow so to be fairly nicely covered
and I would probably just have this like

486
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:51,980
and I would probably just have this like
 

487
00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:05,020
and I would probably just have this like
that yeah I don't know kind of like that

488
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,030
that yeah I don't know kind of like that
 

489
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,300
that yeah I don't know kind of like that
I'm thinking and then just have the

490
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,310
I'm thinking and then just have the
 

491
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,790
I'm thinking and then just have the
crack open here you won't be looking at

492
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:09,800
crack open here you won't be looking at
 

493
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,270
crack open here you won't be looking at
the crack if you're on the side and you

494
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,280
the crack if you're on the side and you
 

495
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,120
the crack if you're on the side and you
can still see the board pretty easy yeah

496
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,130
can still see the board pretty easy yeah
 

497
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,960
can still see the board pretty easy yeah
I think I got it now

498
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:19,970
I think I got it now
 

499
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,930
I think I got it now
I think this is how I want to do it I

500
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:21,940
I think this is how I want to do it I
 

501
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,580
I think this is how I want to do it I
think it looks good I got to be careful

502
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:24,590
think it looks good I got to be careful
 

503
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,240
think it looks good I got to be careful
not to abuse sandstone too much people

504
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,250
not to abuse sandstone too much people
 

505
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,640
not to abuse sandstone too much people
chew me out for that so this is probably

506
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:30,650
chew me out for that so this is probably
 

507
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,410
chew me out for that so this is probably
all the sandstone I will have in this

508
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,420
all the sandstone I will have in this
 

509
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,710
all the sandstone I will have in this
building that we're making what you see

510
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:35,720
building that we're making what you see
 

511
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,450
building that we're making what you see
here and I'll probably do the rest out

512
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,460
here and I'll probably do the rest out
 

513
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,470
here and I'll probably do the rest out
of wood and stuff it just looks so good

514
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:41,480
of wood and stuff it just looks so good
 

515
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,730
of wood and stuff it just looks so good
I can't resist

516
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:45,740

 

517
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,280

yeah well the wires come out the back

518
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,290
yeah well the wires come out the back
 

519
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,980
yeah well the wires come out the back
like this there's a 1 yep 1 wide gap

520
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:50,990
like this there's a 1 yep 1 wide gap
 

521
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,140
like this there's a 1 yep 1 wide gap
between them which is nice so this

522
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,150
between them which is nice so this
 

523
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,480
between them which is nice so this
button lights up that wire and then this

524
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,490
button lights up that wire and then this
 

525
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,620
button lights up that wire and then this
button lights up this wire so I need to

526
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:05,630
button lights up this wire so I need to
 

527
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,810
button lights up this wire so I need to
keep them separate and I'll probably

528
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:10,820
keep them separate and I'll probably
 

529
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,710
keep them separate and I'll probably
spiral them down into the ground run

530
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
spiral them down into the ground run
 

531
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
spiral them down into the ground run
them underground underneath all this

532
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,490
them underground underneath all this
 

533
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,400
them underground underneath all this
stuff we have here it'll have to be

534
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,410
stuff we have here it'll have to be
 

535
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,300
stuff we have here it'll have to be
fairly deep and then further to the

536
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,310
fairly deep and then further to the
 

537
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,670
fairly deep and then further to the
right here we'll have that I don't know

538
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:24,680
right here we'll have that I don't know
 

539
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,310
right here we'll have that I don't know
if you remember that memory punch card

540
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,320
if you remember that memory punch card
 

541
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,820
if you remember that memory punch card
unit loop thing I had in my previous

542
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:30,830
unit loop thing I had in my previous
 

543
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,420
unit loop thing I had in my previous
video I got to build that and the

544
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,430
video I got to build that and the
 

545
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,930
video I got to build that and the
win-lose logic all that stuff over there

546
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:37,940
win-lose logic all that stuff over there
 

547
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,340
win-lose logic all that stuff over there
somewhere and this covers up relatively

548
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,350
somewhere and this covers up relatively
 

549
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:49,020
somewhere and this covers up relatively
nicely you know something like that

550
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,030
nicely you know something like that
 

551
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,680
nicely you know something like that
looks okay I think could even put one

552
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:52,690
looks okay I think could even put one
 

553
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,510
looks okay I think could even put one
more in here yeah

554
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,520
more in here yeah
 

555
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,430
more in here yeah
that's what you would see on the bat if

556
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
that's what you would see on the bat if
 

557
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,830
that's what you would see on the bat if
I did it this way which I I feel it's

558
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:01,840
I did it this way which I I feel it's
 

559
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,910
I did it this way which I I feel it's
acceptable otherwise I'd have to build

560
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
acceptable otherwise I'd have to build
 

561
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,320
acceptable otherwise I'd have to build
up higher and it would block your view

562
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,330
up higher and it would block your view
 

563
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,140
up higher and it would block your view
of this panel and that would suck okay

564
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,150
of this panel and that would suck okay
 

565
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,910
of this panel and that would suck okay
and I'll probably have like wood planks

566
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:14,920
and I'll probably have like wood planks
 

567
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,460
and I'll probably have like wood planks
and stuff around the sandstone but I'll

568
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,470
and stuff around the sandstone but I'll
 

569
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:31,920
and stuff around the sandstone but I'll
do that later much brighter well guys

570
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:31,930
do that later much brighter well guys
 

571
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,840
do that later much brighter well guys
I'm about to go to bed here it's getting

572
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:33,850
I'm about to go to bed here it's getting
 

573
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,210
I'm about to go to bed here it's getting
late so I'll probably wrap this episode

574
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,220
late so I'll probably wrap this episode
 

575
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,440
late so I'll probably wrap this episode
soon wrap this episode up soon one thing

576
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,450
soon wrap this episode up soon one thing
 

577
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,910
soon wrap this episode up soon one thing

ideas and I will be using some of these

584
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,090
ideas and I will be using some of these
 

585
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,510
ideas and I will be using some of these
so it's much appreciated especially I

586

note block sequences they are very handy

590
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:57,610
note block sequences they are very handy
 

591
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,850
note block sequences they are very handy
because I'm not very good with music in

592
00:16:59,850 --> 00:16:59,860
because I'm not very good with music in
 

593
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,800
because I'm not very good with music in
that so I have lots to choose from it's

594
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:04,810
that so I have lots to choose from it's
 

595
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,120
that so I have lots to choose from it's
great and this wiring here turned out

596
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,130
great and this wiring here turned out
 

597
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,920
great and this wiring here turned out
really well it just spirals down it's

598
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:13,930
really well it just spirals down it's
 

599
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,949
really well it just spirals down it's
easy to keep separate like this still

600
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
easy to keep separate like this still
 

601
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,490
easy to keep separate like this still
separate here but at some point we need

602
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:20,500
separate here but at some point we need
 

603
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,380
separate here but at some point we need
to join it together which I'm doing over

604
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,390
to join it together which I'm doing over
 

605
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:30,570
to join it together which I'm doing over
here and these will connect to that

606
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:30,580
here and these will connect to that
 

607
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,670
here and these will connect to that
punch card memory thing I got to build

608
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:32,680
punch card memory thing I got to build
 

609
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,670
punch card memory thing I got to build
that like we originally planned you know

610
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:38,680
that like we originally planned you know
 

611
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,700
that like we originally planned you know
if you watch the I think his episode 95

612
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,710
if you watch the I think his episode 95
 

613
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,390
if you watch the I think his episode 95
where I did all this and I'm trying to

614
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
where I did all this and I'm trying to
 

615
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,830
where I did all this and I'm trying to
keep it 16 blocks away or more from the

616
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:52,840
keep it 16 blocks away or more from the
 

617
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,190
keep it 16 blocks away or more from the
player over here so that the player

618
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,200
player over here so that the player
 

619
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,490
player over here so that the player
won't hear the Pistons looping around

620
00:17:59,490 --> 00:17:59,500
won't hear the Pistons looping around
 

621
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,780
won't hear the Pistons looping around
just to make it a little bit nicer

622
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:02,790
just to make it a little bit nicer
 

623
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,050
just to make it a little bit nicer
that's good I haven't run this wire yet

624
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,060
that's good I haven't run this wire yet
 

625
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,240
that's good I haven't run this wire yet
though so I'll just probably run it

626
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,250
though so I'll just probably run it
 

627
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,040
though so I'll just probably run it
beside these ones once I figure them out

628
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,050

 

629
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:23,700

yeah so I think that's where I'm gonna

630
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:23,710
yeah so I think that's where I'm gonna
 

631
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,830
yeah so I think that's where I'm gonna
end it because I'm I'm getting tired as

632
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
end it because I'm I'm getting tired as
 

633
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,080
end it because I'm I'm getting tired as
you can probably tell by my voice

634
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,090
you can probably tell by my voice
 

635
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,190
you can probably tell by my voice
although I always sound sleepy so it

636
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,200
although I always sound sleepy so it
 

637
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,920
although I always sound sleepy so it
should be cool when it's done and I will
