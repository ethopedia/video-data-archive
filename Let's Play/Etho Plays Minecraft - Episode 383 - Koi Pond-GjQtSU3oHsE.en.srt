was doing some chords hunting and I'm
 

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,650
was doing some chords hunting and I'm
gonna be breaking this all down while I

14
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:27,660
gonna be breaking this all down while I
 

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,620
gonna be breaking this all down while I

oh man oh you know that that feeling
 

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,500
oh man oh you know that that feeling
what like when it's when it's beyond

20
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:36,510
what like when it's when it's beyond
 

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,150
what like when it's when it's beyond

when it feels like you got a black hole

24
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
when it feels like you got a black hole
 

25
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,440
when it feels like you got a black hole
in in your stomach that's where I'm at

26
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,450
in in your stomach that's where I'm at
 

27
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,810
in in your stomach that's where I'm at
right now like the walls are caving in

28
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
right now like the walls are caving in
 

29
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,319
right now like the walls are caving in
and everything is gonna get sucked in if

30
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:48,329
and everything is gonna get sucked in if
 

31
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,830
and everything is gonna get sucked in if
I'm if I don't eat soon alright so I

32
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm if I don't eat soon alright so I
 

33
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,630
I'm if I don't eat soon alright so I
don't know how much this is I just keep

34
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
don't know how much this is I just keep
 

35
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,319
don't know how much this is I just keep
adding and adding to it and it's it

36
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:57,329
adding and adding to it and it's it
 

37
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,880
adding and adding to it and it's it
looks like a lot of courts it's probably

38
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:58,890
looks like a lot of courts it's probably
 

39
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,040
looks like a lot of courts it's probably
not going to be much though is it it's

40
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
not going to be much though is it it's
 

41
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,670
not going to be much though is it it's
always deceptive because each like I

42
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
always deceptive because each like I
 

43
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,980
always deceptive because each like I
think to two blocks on average works out

44
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:06,990
think to two blocks on average works out
 

45
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,570
think to two blocks on average works out
to one quartz block so it's not much but

46
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:11,580
to one quartz block so it's not much but
 

47
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,890
to one quartz block so it's not much but
we'll see what we end up with and I'm

48
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
we'll see what we end up with and I'm
 

49
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,660
we'll see what we end up with and I'm
going to do some building on the Nexus

50
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:14,670
going to do some building on the Nexus
 

51
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,630
going to do some building on the Nexus
here so in total from all that quartz we

52
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:17,640
here so in total from all that quartz we
 

53
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,880
here so in total from all that quartz we
got nine stacks of quartz blocks which

54
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:19,890
got nine stacks of quartz blocks which
 

55
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,149
got nine stacks of quartz blocks which
is not too bad it's not too bad but I'm

56
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,159
is not too bad it's not too bad but I'm
 

57
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,160
is not too bad it's not too bad but I'm
using that very quickly here we're just

58
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,170
using that very quickly here we're just
 

59
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,980
using that very quickly here we're just
about out in fact and we got a lot left

60
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,990
about out in fact and we got a lot left
 

61
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,700
about out in fact and we got a lot left
to do

62
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:28,710
to do
 

63
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,899
to do
unfortunately so I put the border of

64
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:32,909
unfortunately so I put the border of
 

65
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,130
unfortunately so I put the border of
quartz all along the floor here we got a

66
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,140
quartz all along the floor here we got a
 

67
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,069
quartz all along the floor here we got a
run all right we got to do the sides

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
run all right we got to do the sides
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,810
run all right we got to do the sides
here as well which is what I've been

70
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:41,820
here as well which is what I've been
 

71
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,330
here as well which is what I've been
working on as well so I put clay all

72
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,340
working on as well so I put clay all
 

73
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,969
working on as well so I put clay all
along I put in the wire that was giving

74
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:46,979
along I put in the wire that was giving
 

75
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,819
along I put in the wire that was giving
us trouble last time and sort of figured

76
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:49,829
us trouble last time and sort of figured
 

77
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:50,630
us trouble last time and sort of figured
out what to do with that

78
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
out what to do with that
 

79
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,690
out what to do with that
this one here we got that running all

80
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:53,700
this one here we got that running all
 

81
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,359
this one here we got that running all
the way down and I'm covering it up by

82
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,369
the way down and I'm covering it up by
 

83
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,240
the way down and I'm covering it up by
doing this this is the design I settled

84
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,250
doing this this is the design I settled
 

85
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,929
doing this this is the design I settled
on so it looks a little bit different

86
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
on so it looks a little bit different
 

87
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,899
on so it looks a little bit different
now but I think that's okay

88
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:04,909
now but I think that's okay
 

89
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,100
now but I think that's okay
because the wiring is right behind this

90
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,110
because the wiring is right behind this
 

91
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,680
because the wiring is right behind this
quartz stair here so I had to bring that

92
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,690
quartz stair here so I had to bring that
 

93
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,910
quartz stair here so I had to bring that
down a bit

94
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
down a bit
 

95
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,390
down a bit
anyway it's coming along

96
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
anyway it's coming along
 

97
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,060
anyway it's coming along
today we're going to try figure out how

98
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,070
today we're going to try figure out how
 

99
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,480
today we're going to try figure out how
to get the item sorter working here so

100
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,490
to get the item sorter working here so
 

101
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,940
to get the item sorter working here so
let's go take a look we got a run here

102
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:25,950
let's go take a look we got a run here
 

103
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,970
let's go take a look we got a run here
let's get up here sure wish I had a

104
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:28,980
let's get up here sure wish I had a
 

105
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,040
let's get up here sure wish I had a
jetpack

106
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,050
jetpack
 

107
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,380
jetpack
yeah see this ice here we got to run a

108
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,390
yeah see this ice here we got to run a
 

109
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,720
yeah see this ice here we got to run a
strip of that all the way down and then

110
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:35,730
strip of that all the way down and then
 

111
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,250
strip of that all the way down and then
we got to put water on top and like

112
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,260
we got to put water on top and like
 

113
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,430
we got to put water on top and like
fences over these hoppers and see if the

114
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
fences over these hoppers and see if the
 

115
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,210
fences over these hoppers and see if the
items will go on the ice as well as the

116
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,220
items will go on the ice as well as the
 

117
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,090
items will go on the ice as well as the
hoppers if we can align it properly so

118
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,100
hoppers if we can align it properly so
 

119
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,890
hoppers if we can align it properly so
that's that's what we're going to try

120
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:48,900
that's that's what we're going to try
 

121
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,010
that's that's what we're going to try
set up so I kind of got this set up now

122
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,020
set up so I kind of got this set up now
 

123
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,080
set up so I kind of got this set up now
we got the ice down we got some glass to

124
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,090
we got the ice down we got some glass to
 

125
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,640
we got the ice down we got some glass to
hold the water in place so it doesn't

126
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,650
hold the water in place so it doesn't
 

127
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,850
hold the water in place so it doesn't
leak out and signs now I got to decide

128
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:58,860
leak out and signs now I got to decide
 

129
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,190
leak out and signs now I got to decide
which way should the water flow either

130
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
which way should the water flow either
 

131
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,720
which way should the water flow either
this way or this way not too sure so

132
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:05,730
this way or this way not too sure so
 

133
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,000
this way or this way not too sure so
maybe let's plan that out this is for

134
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,010
maybe let's plan that out this is for
 

135
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,890
maybe let's plan that out this is for
putting items into the chest right the

136
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:09,900
putting items into the chest right the
 

137
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,100
putting items into the chest right the
item items storage and sorting so I'm

138
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,110
item items storage and sorting so I'm
 

139
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,320
item items storage and sorting so I'm
guessing we'll have a chest somewhere on

140
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,330
guessing we'll have a chest somewhere on
 

141
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,449
guessing we'll have a chest somewhere on
this end of the building we'll put our

142
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459
this end of the building we'll put our
 

143
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,680
this end of the building we'll put our
stuff in it and then probably will want

144
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,690
stuff in it and then probably will want
 

145
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,160
stuff in it and then probably will want
an elevator to bring the items up high

146
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,170
an elevator to bring the items up high
 

147
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,920
an elevator to bring the items up high
right and then they'll go split to the

148
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:27,930
right and then they'll go split to the
 

149
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,449
right and then they'll go split to the
left and to the right to the four water

150
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,459
left and to the right to the four water
 

151
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,240
left and to the right to the four water
streams up here so the items will

152
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,250
streams up here so the items will
 

153
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,400
streams up here so the items will
probably flow down this way and then

154
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,410
probably flow down this way and then
 

155
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,570
probably flow down this way and then
we'll drop why she no that doesn't work

156
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:40,580
we'll drop why she no that doesn't work
 

157
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,250
we'll drop why she no that doesn't work
we need the items to pass by all eight

158
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,260
we need the items to pass by all eight
 

159
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,020
we need the items to pass by all eight
of these sections like eat all eight of

160
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,030
of these sections like eat all eight of
 

161
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,270
of these sections like eat all eight of
these sides this one this one this one

162
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
these sides this one this one this one
 

163
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,460
these sides this one this one this one
this one and those four over there right

164
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
this one and those four over there right
 

165
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,750
this one and those four over there right
ah maybe I thought we would like make it

166
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
ah maybe I thought we would like make it
 

167
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,340
ah maybe I thought we would like make it
go that way drop down then go this way

168
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,350
go that way drop down then go this way
 

169
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,600
go that way drop down then go this way
but no we should take care of the top

170
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,610
but no we should take care of the top
 

171
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,810
but no we should take care of the top
layer first so maybe the items will go

172
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:04,820
layer first so maybe the items will go
 

173
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,050
layer first so maybe the items will go
to the left then like that way then back

174
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,060
to the left then like that way then back
 

175
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,360
to the left then like that way then back
on the second row towards us then on

176
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,370
on the second row towards us then on
 

177
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,080
on the second row towards us then on
this row back to the wall then this way

178
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,090
this row back to the wall then this way
 

179
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,990
this row back to the wall then this way
so then this one would go this way

180
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
so then this one would go this way
 

181
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
so then this one would go this way
because it would drop down then this way

182
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,450
because it would drop down then this way
 

183
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,719
because it would drop down then this way
this way this way and this way and that

184
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:23,729
this way this way and this way and that
 

185
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,640
this way this way and this way and that
will complete the cycle hopefully

186
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:26,650
will complete the cycle hopefully
 

187
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,870
will complete the cycle hopefully
um yeah okay so we what did I say this

188
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
um yeah okay so we what did I say this
 

189
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,219
um yeah okay so we what did I say this
way let's go this way all right so I'm

190
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:35,229
way let's go this way all right so I'm
 

191
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,909
way let's go this way all right so I'm
going to break the ice good all right so

192
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:38,919
going to break the ice good all right so
 

193
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,590
going to break the ice good all right so
I got the water in here and I'm just

194
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,600
I got the water in here and I'm just
 

195
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,560
I got the water in here and I'm just
doing a test now this is a trick the zip

196
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:43,570
doing a test now this is a trick the zip
 

197
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,200
doing a test now this is a trick the zip
crowd guys came up with I believe where

198
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,210
crowd guys came up with I believe where
 

199
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,719
crowd guys came up with I believe where
you you have to enter chests and since

200
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:48,729
you you have to enter chests and since
 

201
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,999
you you have to enter chests and since
they're just a little bit smaller than a

202
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,009
they're just a little bit smaller than a
 

203
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,210
they're just a little bit smaller than a
full block the item can move a little

204
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,220
full block the item can move a little
 

205
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,580
full block the item can move a little
bit further so that it's both on this

206
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,590
bit further so that it's both on this
 

207
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,279
bit further so that it's both on this
block and this one so it's like right on

208
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,289
block and this one so it's like right on
 

209
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:02,480
block and this one so it's like right on
the line and when it does that it will

210
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,490
the line and when it does that it will
 

211
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,100
the line and when it does that it will
still have this speed boost from the ice

212
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,110
still have this speed boost from the ice
 

213
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,170
still have this speed boost from the ice
but also be able to go into the hoppers

214
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,180
but also be able to go into the hoppers
 

215
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,529
but also be able to go into the hoppers
so just show you that I'm going to throw

216
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:10,539
so just show you that I'm going to throw
 

217
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,930
so just show you that I'm going to throw
a torch into the wall there

218
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:12,940
a torch into the wall there
 

219
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,390
a torch into the wall there
hits the ender chest and then you see

220
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,400
hits the ender chest and then you see
 

221
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,010
hits the ender chest and then you see
how quickly it keeps going even over top

222
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,020
how quickly it keeps going even over top
 

223
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,770
how quickly it keeps going even over top
the hoppers there I put some items in

224
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:19,780
the hoppers there I put some items in
 

225
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,620
the hoppers there I put some items in
the these first four just to test this

226
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:21,630
the these first four just to test this
 

227
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,719
the these first four just to test this
so it'll be able to pass over top but

228
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:24,729
so it'll be able to pass over top but
 

229
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,890
so it'll be able to pass over top but
yeah just watch the torch zips on until

230
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:28,900
yeah just watch the torch zips on until
 

231
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,020
yeah just watch the torch zips on until
it hits these hoppers and then since

232
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,030
it hits these hoppers and then since
 

233
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,279
it hits these hoppers and then since
there's no items and these ones that's

234
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,289
there's no items and these ones that's
 

235
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,740
there's no items and these ones that's
where it ends up so that's pretty cool

236
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:34,750
where it ends up so that's pretty cool
 

237
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,589
where it ends up so that's pretty cool
and it turns out to ender chests is very

238
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:37,599
and it turns out to ender chests is very
 

239
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,420
and it turns out to ender chests is very
important for this like if you just have

240
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,430
important for this like if you just have
 

241
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,680
important for this like if you just have
one I was noticing it doesn't seem to

242
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:43,690
one I was noticing it doesn't seem to
 

243
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,779
one I was noticing it doesn't seem to
work yeah it's just sometimes it goes

244
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:48,789
work yeah it's just sometimes it goes
 

245
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,399
work yeah it's just sometimes it goes
over a little bit even if it does hit

246
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:50,409
over a little bit even if it does hit
 

247
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,629
over a little bit even if it does hit
the ender chest properly Oh even if it

248
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
the ender chest properly Oh even if it
 

249
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,450
the ender chest properly Oh even if it
hits it properly and it's aligned

250
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:57,460
hits it properly and it's aligned
 

251
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,219
hits it properly and it's aligned
properly it'll just go really slow

252
00:05:59,219 --> 00:05:59,229
properly it'll just go really slow
 

253
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:01,740
properly it'll just go really slow
overtop the hoppers with just one so

254
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:01,750
overtop the hoppers with just one so
 

255
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,740
overtop the hoppers with just one so
that's why you need to and that's that's

256
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:04,750
that's why you need to and that's that's
 

257
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,510
that's why you need to and that's that's
how we're going to do this so hopefully

258
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
how we're going to do this so hopefully
 

259
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,670
how we're going to do this so hopefully
the items will be able to go through the

260
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:08,680
the items will be able to go through the
 

261
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,350
the items will be able to go through the
thing in less than five minutes so they

262
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,360
thing in less than five minutes so they
 

263
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,790
thing in less than five minutes so they
don'tthey spawn because they have to

264
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:11,800
don'tthey spawn because they have to
 

265
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,330
don'tthey spawn because they have to
travel like they're back they're back

266
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:15,340
travel like they're back they're back
 

267
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,170
travel like they're back they're back
down they're back they're back if that

268
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,180
down they're back they're back if that
 

269
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,760
down they're back they're back if that
takes longer than five minutes we'll

270
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:20,770
takes longer than five minutes we'll
 

271
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,110
takes longer than five minutes we'll
have to refresh them somehow but anyway

272
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
have to refresh them somehow but anyway
 

273
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,580
have to refresh them somehow but anyway
we got a lot done on here today I think

274
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:26,590
we got a lot done on here today I think
 

275
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,290
we got a lot done on here today I think
we'll go do something else I did build a

276
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,300
we'll go do something else I did build a
 

277
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,930
we'll go do something else I did build a
little bit more here but we ran out of

278
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:30,940
little bit more here but we ran out of
 

279
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,899
little bit more here but we ran out of
quarts pretty much so that's all we can

280
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:33,909
quarts pretty much so that's all we can
 

281
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,469
quarts pretty much so that's all we can
do all right guys so next up here I

282
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:37,479
do all right guys so next up here I
 

283
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,940
do all right guys so next up here I
think I want to work on our our

284
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:38,950
think I want to work on our our
 

285
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,500
think I want to work on our our
wheatfields here

286
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,510
wheatfields here
 

287
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,630
wheatfields here
I've been walking around trying to think

288
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:42,640
I've been walking around trying to think
 

289
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,320
I've been walking around trying to think
of what needs to be done yet and I think

290
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,330
of what needs to be done yet and I think
 

291
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,550
of what needs to be done yet and I think
it's actually pretty close to done I

292
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:47,560
it's actually pretty close to done I
 

293
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,920
it's actually pretty close to done I
don't think I'm gonna make it any bigger

294
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:48,930
don't think I'm gonna make it any bigger
 

295
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,930
don't think I'm gonna make it any bigger
it's a good size it looks pretty cool

296
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:51,940
it's a good size it looks pretty cool
 

297
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,240
it's a good size it looks pretty cool
too right but there is one thing missing

298
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,250
too right but there is one thing missing
 

299
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,760
too right but there is one thing missing
well and some weed is missing but

300
00:06:59,760 --> 00:06:59,770
well and some weed is missing but
 

301
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,650
well and some weed is missing but
there's something in particular I feel

302
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:01,660
there's something in particular I feel
 

303
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,050
there's something in particular I feel
this split this sectional and needs to

304
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,060
this split this sectional and needs to
 

305
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,920
this split this sectional and needs to
finalize it a bit better what is it tell

306
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:07,930
finalize it a bit better what is it tell
 

307
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,760
finalize it a bit better what is it tell
me look around you know aha I think this

308
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:14,770
me look around you know aha I think this
 

309
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,920
me look around you know aha I think this
looks really strange here like when you

310
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,930
looks really strange here like when you
 

311
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,630
looks really strange here like when you
when you walk up to it just to have the

312
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:18,640
when you walk up to it just to have the
 

313
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,520
when you walk up to it just to have the
wheats there with no real border now not

314
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,530
wheats there with no real border now not
 

315
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,770
wheats there with no real border now not
so great so we're going to put a fence

316
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:25,780
so great so we're going to put a fence
 

317
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,560
so great so we're going to put a fence
around it and I think that'll be a good

318
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,570
around it and I think that'll be a good
 

319
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,230
around it and I think that'll be a good
like conclusion to how far it should

320
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,240
like conclusion to how far it should
 

321
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,720
like conclusion to how far it should
stretch so that that's what we're going

322
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:33,730
stretch so that that's what we're going
 

323
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,920
stretch so that that's what we're going
to do we're going to put a fence around

324
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:34,930
to do we're going to put a fence around
 

325
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,320
to do we're going to put a fence around
and then it'll be pretty much done I

326
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,330
and then it'll be pretty much done I
 

327
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,640
and then it'll be pretty much done I
would say so it's playing around with

328
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,650
would say so it's playing around with
 

329
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,040
would say so it's playing around with
fence ideas I think we'll do it like

330
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,050
fence ideas I think we'll do it like
 

331
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,180
fence ideas I think we'll do it like
this just fairly simple I don't want to

332
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,190
this just fairly simple I don't want to
 

333
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,710
this just fairly simple I don't want to
make it too complicated because it's got

334
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:49,720
make it too complicated because it's got
 

335
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,210
make it too complicated because it's got
to cover a large area here and it'll

336
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:51,220
to cover a large area here and it'll
 

337
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,490
to cover a large area here and it'll
take me forever if I did carry it away

338
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:53,500
take me forever if I did carry it away
 

339
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,560
take me forever if I did carry it away
so I just brought a couple logs with me

340
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:58,570
so I just brought a couple logs with me
 

341
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,120
so I just brought a couple logs with me
so that we can add some posts so just

342
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,130
so that we can add some posts so just
 

343
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,520
so that we can add some posts so just
like adding a couple logs every so often

344
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,530
like adding a couple logs every so often
 

345
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,880
like adding a couple logs every so often
just a little bit of detail adds a lot

346
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:08,890
just a little bit of detail adds a lot
 

347
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,870
just a little bit of detail adds a lot
to it I think like look at this compare

348
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:12,880
to it I think like look at this compare
 

349
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,030
to it I think like look at this compare
that to what we had just the regular

350
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,040
that to what we had just the regular
 

351
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,130
that to what we had just the regular
fence much much better I think right and

352
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,140
fence much much better I think right and
 

353
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,950
fence much much better I think right and
then you can go a little bit further I

354
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
then you can go a little bit further I
 

355
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,900
then you can go a little bit further I
was considering putting slabs on top

356
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:24,910
was considering putting slabs on top
 

357
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,720
was considering putting slabs on top
like so and maybe even let's do the

358
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:30,730
like so and maybe even let's do the
 

359
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,730
like so and maybe even let's do the
glowstone and trapdoor thing I do like

360
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:32,740
glowstone and trapdoor thing I do like
 

361
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,640
glowstone and trapdoor thing I do like
this a lot like when you have the

362
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:35,650
this a lot like when you have the
 

363
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,230
this a lot like when you have the
glowstone like this and then we put

364
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240
glowstone like this and then we put
 

365
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,589
glowstone like this and then we put
trapdoors all around I don't think

366
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599
trapdoors all around I don't think
 

367
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,120
trapdoors all around I don't think
people do this as often anymore it's

368
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,130
people do this as often anymore it's
 

369
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,240
people do this as often anymore it's
like an old I don't know there's

370
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,250
like an old I don't know there's
 

371
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,000
like an old I don't know there's
probably better ways of making like

372
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,010
probably better ways of making like
 

373
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,520
probably better ways of making like
light posts type of thing but I think

374
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,530
light posts type of thing but I think
 

375
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,210
light posts type of thing but I think
that's okay so we'll do that maybe every

376
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:54,220
that's okay so we'll do that maybe every
 

377
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,869
that's okay so we'll do that maybe every
second one and that will add more detail

378
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:57,879
second one and that will add more detail
 

379
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,900
second one and that will add more detail
to it and I think that'll be pretty good

380
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:02,910
to it and I think that'll be pretty good
 

381
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,829
to it and I think that'll be pretty good
hopefully that doesn't take too long for

382
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:04,839
hopefully that doesn't take too long for
 

383
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:05,960
hopefully that doesn't take too long for
me to build

384
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:05,970
me to build
 

385
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:13,230
me to build
oops all right so how's that yeah I

386
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,240
oops all right so how's that yeah I
 

387
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,189
oops all right so how's that yeah I
think that's good

388
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:14,199
think that's good
 

389
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,819
think that's good
ah actually maybe I just want to try

390
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:17,829
ah actually maybe I just want to try
 

391
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,030
ah actually maybe I just want to try
something maybe we'll lower this one any

392
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
something maybe we'll lower this one any
 

393
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,340
something maybe we'll lower this one any
slight variation just makes quite a

394
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,350
slight variation just makes quite a
 

395
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,160
slight variation just makes quite a
difference even to a simple pattern like

396
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,170
difference even to a simple pattern like
 

397
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:32,519
difference even to a simple pattern like
this yeah let's do it like this this

398
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:32,529
this yeah let's do it like this this
 

399
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:33,809
this yeah let's do it like this this
little so we'll have the different

400
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:33,819
little so we'll have the different
 

401
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,629
little so we'll have the different
heights to it - uh-huh so I'm going to

402
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:36,639
heights to it - uh-huh so I'm going to
 

403
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,150
heights to it - uh-huh so I'm going to
go all around the property hopefully and

404
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
go all around the property hopefully and
 

405
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,850
go all around the property hopefully and
then we'll extend the wheats up to the

406
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:41,860
then we'll extend the wheats up to the
 

407
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,769
then we'll extend the wheats up to the
fence however I lay it out and that'll

408
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:43,779
fence however I lay it out and that'll
 

409
00:09:43,779 --> 00:10:00,470
fence however I lay it out and that'll
be like the finalized look to the place

410
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480

 

411
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,750

so I've been building the fence here

412
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:02,760
so I've been building the fence here
 

413
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,790
so I've been building the fence here
guys got a little section done here and

414
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
guys got a little section done here and
 

415
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,390
guys got a little section done here and
I took a step back to look at it and now

416
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,400
I took a step back to look at it and now
 

417
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,870
I took a step back to look at it and now
that I see it you know what I don't like

418
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:11,880
that I see it you know what I don't like
 

419
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,820
that I see it you know what I don't like
these lights anymore they look they're

420
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,830
these lights anymore they look they're
 

421
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,180
these lights anymore they look they're
too Balti aren't they yeah you probably

422
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,190
too Balti aren't they yeah you probably
 

423
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,850
too Balti aren't they yeah you probably
called it before I even did it we're

424
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:19,860
called it before I even did it we're
 

425
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,200
called it before I even did it we're
going to get rid of them I think I'm

426
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,210
going to get rid of them I think I'm
 

427
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,790
going to get rid of them I think I'm
going to just keep all the posts the

428
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
going to just keep all the posts the
 

429
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,090
going to just keep all the posts the
same height - ooh because otherwise it

430
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,100
same height - ooh because otherwise it
 

431
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,210
same height - ooh because otherwise it
looks a bit strange I've been finding

432
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,220
looks a bit strange I've been finding
 

433
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,160
looks a bit strange I've been finding
all right

434
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,170
all right
 

435
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,960
all right
aha so little by little piece by piece

436
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:32,970
aha so little by little piece by piece
 

437
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,450
aha so little by little piece by piece
guys I feel this area is starting to

438
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:35,460
guys I feel this area is starting to
 

439
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,270
guys I feel this area is starting to
come together pretty good remember it

440
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,280
come together pretty good remember it
 

441
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,550
come together pretty good remember it
was just empty plains before nothing was

442
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
was just empty plains before nothing was
 

443
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,970
was just empty plains before nothing was
here it was this flat flat land and

444
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:43,980
here it was this flat flat land and
 

445
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,370
here it was this flat flat land and
grass and now we got some trees we got

446
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,380
grass and now we got some trees we got
 

447
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,190
grass and now we got some trees we got
that you've been ethought over there was

448
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
that you've been ethought over there was
 

449
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,860
that you've been ethought over there was
just a mountain before got the lake that

450
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:51,870
just a mountain before got the lake that
 

451
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,280
just a mountain before got the lake that
shoots fireworks out of it and a little

452
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,290
shoots fireworks out of it and a little
 

453
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,110
shoots fireworks out of it and a little
bit further up we have our wheat field

454
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
bit further up we have our wheat field
 

455
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,960
bit further up we have our wheat field
so this is the fence goes all the way

456
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,970
so this is the fence goes all the way
 

457
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,310
so this is the fence goes all the way
around and now we need to start like

458
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,320
around and now we need to start like
 

459
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,350
around and now we need to start like
just filling in the rest of it like

460
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
just filling in the rest of it like
 

461
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,510
just filling in the rest of it like
these little pieces here I think I'm

462
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,520
these little pieces here I think I'm
 

463
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,040
these little pieces here I think I'm
going to make them come all the way up

464
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,050
going to make them come all the way up
 

465
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,380
going to make them come all the way up
to the fence probably but we can't do

466
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,390
to the fence probably but we can't do
 

467
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,820
to the fence probably but we can't do
that today I don't have enough seeds to

468
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:16,830
that today I don't have enough seeds to
 

469
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,830
that today I don't have enough seeds to
do it all this is the last of what I

470
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:18,840
