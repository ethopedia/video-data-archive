00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,570
didn't imagine that yeah so this doesn't
 

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,180
didn't imagine that yeah so this doesn't
work anymore hey everybody check out my

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,190
work anymore hey everybody check out my
 

9

work anymore hey everybody check out my
new box or derp it works awesome for one

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:41,489
new box or derp it works awesome for one
 

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,250
new box or derp it works awesome for one
day cutting-edge technology for one day

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,260
day cutting-edge technology for one day
 

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,610
day cutting-edge technology for one day
and now we're at 1.3 and mob behaviors

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,620
and now we're at 1.3 and mob behaviors
 

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,439
and now we're at 1.3 and mob behaviors
got changed and now it doesn't know

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,449
got changed and now it doesn't know
 

17
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:06,080
got changed and now it doesn't know
anyone but not to fear I think I'll be

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,090
anyone but not to fear I think I'll be
 

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:23,899
anyone but not to fear I think I'll be
able to rebuild it all right so this is

20
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:23,909
able to rebuild it all right so this is
 

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:31,030
able to rebuild it all right so this is
kind of strange mob behavior changed and

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
kind of strange mob behavior changed and
 

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,950
kind of strange mob behavior changed and
remember I told you not to build it this

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
remember I told you not to build it this
 

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,069
remember I told you not to build it this
way what is this don't build it I said

26
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
way what is this don't build it I said
 

27
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,020
way what is this don't build it I said
don't build it east west and now North

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,030
don't build it east west and now North
 

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,660
don't build it east west and now North
the South doesn't work or whatever and

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:47,670
the South doesn't work or whatever and
 

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,399
the South doesn't work or whatever and
now East the West does so I built this

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,409
now East the West does so I built this
 

33
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,330
now East the West does so I built this
little tunnel thing as a test and before

34
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,340
little tunnel thing as a test and before
 

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,670
little tunnel thing as a test and before
the mobs used to freeze when they would

36
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:00,680
the mobs used to freeze when they would
 

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,740
the mobs used to freeze when they would
see you when you were in this tunnel

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:04,750

 

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,980

alright here's a zombie so before they

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:08,990
alright here's a zombie so before they
 

41
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,120
alright here's a zombie so before they
used to freeze this is MCU and now

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,130
used to freeze this is MCU and now
 

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,199
used to freeze this is MCU and now
they'll come after you so kind of

44
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,209
they'll come after you so kind of
 

45
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:21,040
they'll come after you so kind of
interesting

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,050
interesting
 

47
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:29,260
interesting
oh and so I thought if I built at East

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,270
oh and so I thought if I built at East
 

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,410
oh and so I thought if I built at East
the West it would work again so that's

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,420
the West it would work again so that's
 

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,949
the West it would work again so that's
exactly what I did

52
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
exactly what I did
 

53
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,720
exactly what I did
built an exact copy and it doesn't work

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:40,730
built an exact copy and it doesn't work
 

55
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,140
built an exact copy and it doesn't work
either because they freeze when they get

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,150
either because they freeze when they get
 

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,229
either because they freeze when they get
to the first pad there they don't charge

58
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:47,239
to the first pad there they don't charge
 

59
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,960
to the first pad there they don't charge
after you and I think the reason is

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:52,970
after you and I think the reason is
 

61
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,720
after you and I think the reason is
because it's high off the ground this is

62
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:55,730
because it's high off the ground this is
 

63
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,440
because it's high off the ground this is
my theory

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,450
my theory
 

65
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,080
my theory
I think the mobs freeze because they're

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,090
I think the mobs freeze because they're
 

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,370
I think the mobs freeze because they're
pathfinding senses that they're high

68
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,380
pathfinding senses that they're high
 

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,110
pathfinding senses that they're high
above the ground or something and so

70
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
above the ground or something and so
 

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,890
above the ground or something and so
they freeze instead of charging so I

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:08,900
they freeze instead of charging so I
 

73
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,069
they freeze instead of charging so I
think if I place a fake ground under the

74
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:12,079
think if I place a fake ground under the
 

75
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:18,520
think if I place a fake ground under the
sing it'll work but I'll have to try

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,530
sing it'll work but I'll have to try
 

77
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,530
sing it'll work but I'll have to try
that later

78
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:23,540

 

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,479

so I'm a little bummed out this doesn't

80
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,489
so I'm a little bummed out this doesn't
 

81
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,899
so I'm a little bummed out this doesn't
work anymore but I'm confident it'll

82
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:28,909
work anymore but I'm confident it'll
 

83
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,699
work anymore but I'm confident it'll
I'll be able to get it working or

84
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:30,709
I'll be able to get it working or
 

85
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,839
I'll be able to get it working or
someone else will

86
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:33,849

 

87
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,690

the mob still behave the same way

88
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:37,700
the mob still behave the same way
 

89
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,509
the mob still behave the same way
skeletons still the left and creepers

90
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:40,519
skeletons still the left and creepers
 

91
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,470
skeletons still the left and creepers
still the left so there's no reason it

92
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
still the left so there's no reason it
 

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,089
still the left so there's no reason it
won't be possible to get it working

94
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:46,099
won't be possible to get it working
 

95
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,229
won't be possible to get it working
again might have to change a few things

96
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
again might have to change a few things
 

97
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,099
again might have to change a few things
but I'm sure it's possible but other

98
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:54,109
but I'm sure it's possible but other
 

99
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,180
but I'm sure it's possible but other
than that I am actually really psyched

100
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,190
than that I am actually really psyched
 

101
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,569
than that I am actually really psyched
about this new 1.3 patch I think it's

102
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:01,579
about this new 1.3 patch I think it's
 

103
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,470
about this new 1.3 patch I think it's
it's probably my favorite patch yet it's

104
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,480
it's probably my favorite patch yet it's
 

105
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,599
it's probably my favorite patch yet it's
awesome um you guys know I don't use any

106
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:10,609
awesome um you guys know I don't use any
 

107
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,020
awesome um you guys know I don't use any
mods or anything or embed it or anything

108
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,030
mods or anything or embed it or anything
 

109
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,060
mods or anything or embed it or anything
like that but I have been so tempted to

110
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,070
like that but I have been so tempted to
 

111
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,370
like that but I have been so tempted to
download that better light mod forever

112
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,380
download that better light mod forever
 

113
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,659
download that better light mod forever
and I was actually going to do it after

114
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:25,669
and I was actually going to do it after
 

115
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,650
and I was actually going to do it after
the 1.3 patch and then I saw it's

116
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:29,660
the 1.3 patch and then I saw it's
 

117
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,320
the 1.3 patch and then I saw it's
actually included in the 1.3 patch so

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,330
actually included in the 1.3 patch so
 

119
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,089
actually included in the 1.3 patch so
that is totally awesome I'm really happy

120
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:37,099
that is totally awesome I'm really happy
 

121
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:42,129
that is totally awesome I'm really happy
with that I think it looks great and not

122
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:42,139
with that I think it looks great and not
 

123
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:44,260
with that I think it looks great and not
only that we got all these new gadgets

124
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,270
only that we got all these new gadgets
 

125
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,920
only that we got all these new gadgets
to play around with and yeah I've been

126
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:50,930
to play around with and yeah I've been
 

127
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,670
to play around with and yeah I've been
playing around with them a bit and we

128
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680
playing around with them a bit and we
 

129
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,570
playing around with them a bit and we
should spend some time doing that let's

130
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:58,580
should spend some time doing that let's
 

131
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,500
should spend some time doing that let's
see let's get out our torches get some

132
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,510
see let's get out our torches get some
 

133
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,100
see let's get out our torches get some
of our redstone repeaters if you guys

134
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,110
of our redstone repeaters if you guys
 

135
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,839
of our redstone repeaters if you guys
don't already know how to make one of

136
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:13,849
don't already know how to make one of
 

137
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:20,860
don't already know how to make one of
these repeaters it's pretty simple wait

138
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:20,870
these repeaters it's pretty simple wait
 

139
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,129
these repeaters it's pretty simple wait
yeah I forgot for a second and I think

140
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:27,139
yeah I forgot for a second and I think
 

141
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,230
yeah I forgot for a second and I think
that yeah that's how you make a repeater

142
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
that yeah that's how you make a repeater
 

143
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:44,230
that yeah that's how you make a repeater
very interesting little things um let's

144
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
very interesting little things um let's
 

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,980
very interesting little things um let's
see let's get this started

146
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:52,990

 

147
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,390

this is one thing I made the light kind

148
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
this is one thing I made the light kind
 

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,390
this is one thing I made the light kind
of just flashes on for a brief second

150
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,400
of just flashes on for a brief second
 

151
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:17,610
of just flashes on for a brief second
and then it's out not really useful so

152
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:17,620

 

153
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,100

one thing I found very useful with these

154
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,110
one thing I found very useful with these
 

155
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,540
one thing I found very useful with these
is you can now make different clocks

156
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,550
is you can now make different clocks
 

157
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,110
is you can now make different clocks
that are a lot smaller like before if

158
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,120
that are a lot smaller like before if
 

159
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,670
that are a lot smaller like before if
you wanted to make a five o'clock you

160
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
you wanted to make a five o'clock you
 

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,200
you wanted to make a five o'clock you
had to do something like this and it was

162
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,210
had to do something like this and it was
 

163
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,250
had to do something like this and it was
huge and I'm building this because we're

164
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,260
huge and I'm building this because we're
 

165
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:57,670
huge and I'm building this because we're
going to do a test

166
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680

 

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,110

so yeah that's about as small as you can

168
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
so yeah that's about as small as you can
 

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,909
so yeah that's about as small as you can
make I'm sure you can make a little bit

170
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
make I'm sure you can make a little bit
 

171
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,279
make I'm sure you can make a little bit
smaller but that's about the size I have

172
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:04,289
smaller but that's about the size I have
 

173
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:15,010
smaller but that's about the size I have
a 5 o'clock it's 3 by 5 by 2 um

174
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,020
a 5 o'clock it's 3 by 5 by 2 um
 

175
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:28,909
a 5 o'clock it's 3 by 5 by 2 um
wait I'm supposed to be on hard and so I

176
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
wait I'm supposed to be on hard and so I
 

177
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,080
wait I'm supposed to be on hard and so I
was playing around with this the

178
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,090
was playing around with this the
 

179
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,119
was playing around with this the
smallest 5 o'clock I was able to make

180
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,129
smallest 5 o'clock I was able to make
 

181
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,879
smallest 5 o'clock I was able to make
was place your repeater place block in

182
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:37,889
was place your repeater place block in
 

183
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:51,610
was place your repeater place block in
front torch get to that room

184
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:51,620

 

185
00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:03,999

yeah I did reversed and torch behind

186
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,009

 

187
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,240

burns out at that setting go one more it

188
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,250
burns out at that setting go one more it
 

189
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:16,430
burns out at that setting go one more it
also burns out go one more and it works

190
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,440
also burns out go one more and it works
 

191
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,420
also burns out go one more and it works
so I think that's actually one thing I

192
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,430
so I think that's actually one thing I
 

193
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,260
so I think that's actually one thing I
wanted to check I think yeah so this is

194
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,270
wanted to check I think yeah so this is
 

195
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:33,079
wanted to check I think yeah so this is
a 2 by 3 way smaller and it's adjustable

196
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,089
a 2 by 3 way smaller and it's adjustable
 

197
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,019
a 2 by 3 way smaller and it's adjustable
too

198
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:35,029
too
 

199
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,709
too
it's a little bit slower now I think

200
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
it's a little bit slower now I think
 

201
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,459
it's a little bit slower now I think
each of these uh it's got four settings

202
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:43,469
each of these uh it's got four settings
 

203
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,170
each of these uh it's got four settings
this repeater thing 1 2 3 4 I think the

204
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,180
this repeater thing 1 2 3 4 I think the
 

205
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,500
this repeater thing 1 2 3 4 I think the
1 2 3 4 represents torches and not ticks

206
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,510
1 2 3 4 represents torches and not ticks
 

207
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,939
1 2 3 4 represents torches and not ticks
so 2 ticks for ticks 6 sticks and a

208
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:55,949
so 2 ticks for ticks 6 sticks and a
 

209
00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:00,439
so 2 ticks for ticks 6 sticks and a
ticks so I think right now it's actually

210
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:00,449
ticks so I think right now it's actually
 

211
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,000
ticks so I think right now it's actually
a 4 o'clock at the setting

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,010
a 4 o'clock at the setting
 

213
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,579
a 4 o'clock at the setting
it should be blinking slightly faster

214
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:05,589
it should be blinking slightly faster
 

215
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:11,870
it should be blinking slightly faster
than the five o'clock here yeah it is

216
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:11,880
than the five o'clock here yeah it is
 

217
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,939
than the five o'clock here yeah it is
so yeah each of these represents a torch

218
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:16,949
so yeah each of these represents a torch
 

219
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:20,939
so yeah each of these represents a torch
so now it would be a five o'clock that's

220
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:20,949
so now it would be a five o'clock that's
 

221
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,840
so now it would be a five o'clock that's
four plus the one so now they should be

222
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:24,850
four plus the one so now they should be
 

223
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,889
four plus the one so now they should be
blinking at the same exact yeah no

224
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:28,899
blinking at the same exact yeah no
 

225
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:36,120
blinking at the same exact yeah no
difference and so if you want to make it

226
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,130
difference and so if you want to make it
 

227
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,879
difference and so if you want to make it
another if you want to make a slower

228
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:41,889
another if you want to make a slower
 

229
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,939
another if you want to make a slower
clock you'll have to make it a little

230
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:44,949
clock you'll have to make it a little
 

231
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:58,949
clock you'll have to make it a little
bit bigger you can add one their torch

232
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
bit bigger you can add one their torch
 

233
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:11,100
bit bigger you can add one their torch
on the back there so now it's a two by

234
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,110
on the back there so now it's a two by
 

235
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,990
on the back there so now it's a two by
four but we have three of these things

236
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
four but we have three of these things
 

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,819
four but we have three of these things
and so that allows us to make up to a

238
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:20,829
and so that allows us to make up to a
 

239
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:30,850
and so that allows us to make up to a
fork a fork lock up to a what is that

240
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:30,860

 

241
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,350

four eight twelve thirteen we can make

242
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
four eight twelve thirteen we can make
 

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,100
four eight twelve thirteen we can make
up to a 13 o'clock and we can make it

244
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,110
up to a 13 o'clock and we can make it
 

245
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,280
up to a 13 o'clock and we can make it
bigger if we want to even slower

246
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,290
bigger if we want to even slower
 

247
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,620
bigger if we want to even slower
that's pretty compact I saw on the forum

248
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,630
that's pretty compact I saw on the forum
 

249
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,290
that's pretty compact I saw on the forum
someone made a gives a one o'clock the

250
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:53,300
someone made a gives a one o'clock the
 

251
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:01,600
someone made a gives a one o'clock the
way that works is and sorry if this

252
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,610
way that works is and sorry if this
 

253
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,130
way that works is and sorry if this
doesn't interest you it kind of it

254
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,140
doesn't interest you it kind of it
 

255
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:14,620
doesn't interest you it kind of it
interests me yeah so these are set at

256
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:14,630
interests me yeah so these are set at
 

257
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,910
interests me yeah so these are set at
one you place a torch and then remove it

258
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:20,920

 

259
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,480

and I think that's one o'clock maybe

260
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,490
and I think that's one o'clock maybe
 

261
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,980
and I think that's one o'clock maybe
it's a two o'clock and that won't burn

262
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:29,990
it's a two o'clock and that won't burn
 

263
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,920
it's a two o'clock and that won't burn
out but if you leave the world and come

264
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:32,930
out but if you leave the world and come
 

265
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,630
out but if you leave the world and come
back it's not it's going to be stopped

266
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
back it's not it's going to be stopped
 

267
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,240
back it's not it's going to be stopped
so the only way to get it going again I

268
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,250
so the only way to get it going again I
 

269
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,810
so the only way to get it going again I
think is to place a torch and remove it

270
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:42,820
think is to place a torch and remove it
 

271
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,030
think is to place a torch and remove it
if you hook up button up to as a reset

272
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,040
if you hook up button up to as a reset
 

273
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:58,889
if you hook up button up to as a reset
it won't work it just gets stuck on

274
00:11:58,889 --> 00:11:58,899

 

275
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,869

but pretty cool i liking these new

276
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:01,879
but pretty cool i liking these new
 

277
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,759
but pretty cool i liking these new
things they're going to make things a

278
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:03,769
things they're going to make things a
 

279
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,699
things they're going to make things a
lot simpler for me I want to redesign

280
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:06,709
lot simpler for me I want to redesign
 

281
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,600
lot simpler for me I want to redesign
the either amps variable timer using

282
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,610
the either amps variable timer using
 

283
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:23,249
the either amps variable timer using
those I'm sure we made a lot smaller now

284
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:23,259

 

285
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:35,889

and let's see I did this I learned

286
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:35,899
and let's see I did this I learned
 

287
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,540
and let's see I did this I learned
something new to when I was playing

288
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,550
something new to when I was playing
 

289
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:50,019
something new to when I was playing
around with these things so if you place

290
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,029
around with these things so if you place
 

291
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,829
around with these things so if you place
my games get an all-lady here place a

292
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
my games get an all-lady here place a
 

293
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,569
my games get an all-lady here place a
dispenser does nothing if you place a

294
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:55,579
dispenser does nothing if you place a
 

295
00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:01,030
dispenser does nothing if you place a
torch near it starts ticking so if

296
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
torch near it starts ticking so if
 

297
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:16,360
torch near it starts ticking so if
there's power near it so I didn't notice

298
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,370
there's power near it so I didn't notice
 

299
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,420
there's power near it so I didn't notice
but if the dispenser is facing a solid

300
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,430
but if the dispenser is facing a solid
 

301
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,660
but if the dispenser is facing a solid
block and you put something in it it

302
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:22,670
block and you put something in it it
 

303
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,160
block and you put something in it it
actually shoots it through the ground

304
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,170
actually shoots it through the ground
 

305
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:33,129
actually shoots it through the ground
upwards which is interesting I didn't

306
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:33,139
upwards which is interesting I didn't
 

307
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,189
upwards which is interesting I didn't
know that and if you place the block

308
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
know that and if you place the block
 

309
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:47,470
know that and if you place the block
above that one it like places items into

310
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:47,480
above that one it like places items into
 

311
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,980
above that one it like places items into
the ground actually I guess you can pick

312
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:50,990
the ground actually I guess you can pick
 

313
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:58,500
the ground actually I guess you can pick
them up

314
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,510

 

315
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,629

and then if you destroy the block they

316
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:01,639
and then if you destroy the block they
 

317
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:10,569
and then if you destroy the block they
all kind of pop up like that but yeah

318
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:10,579

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,000
experiment too because I'm actually
 

505
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,010
experiment too because I'm actually
working on a computer program right now

506
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,020
working on a computer program right now
 

507
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,540
working on a computer program right now
that I think it is a really good idea

508
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:46,550
that I think it is a really good idea
 

509

518
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
it'll work if I charge people for it
 

519
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,930
it'll work if I charge people for it
because people are just going to pirate

520
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:08,940
because people are just going to pirate
 

521
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,980
because people are just going to pirate
it anyways and it's this going to be

522
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,990
it anyways and it's this going to be
 

523
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,750
it anyways and it's this going to be
just going to annoy people if I charge

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:19,950
money for it so I'm curious to see if
 

527
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,250
money for it so I'm curious to see if
anyone will donate to my minecraft

528
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,260
anyone will donate to my minecraft
 

529
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,020
anyone will donate to my minecraft
videos to see if that's actually a good

530
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,030
videos to see if that's actually a good
 

531
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,250
videos to see if that's actually a good
way of making money because I think

532
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,260
way of making money because I think
 

533
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,900
way of making money because I think
about making a website for my program

534
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:32,910
about making a website for my program
 

535
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,050
about making a website for my program
and then setting up a donation link and

536
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,060
and then setting up a donation link and
 

537
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:50,250
and then setting up a donation link and
making money off the program that way

538
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,260

 

539
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,740

all right she's almost done here um I

540
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:53,750
all right she's almost done here um I
 

541
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,750
all right she's almost done here um I
forgot I wanted to point something else

542
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
forgot I wanted to point something else
 

543
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,090
forgot I wanted to point something else
out with these other Peters too there's

544
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,100
out with these other Peters too there's
 

545
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,280
out with these other Peters too there's
a weird quirk with them

546
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,290

 

547
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:25,000

let's see setup up a lock and a repeater

548
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,010
let's see setup up a lock and a repeater
 

549
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:33,250
let's see setup up a lock and a repeater
here it doesn't change the state of this

550
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,260
here it doesn't change the state of this
 

551
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:44,760
here it doesn't change the state of this
torch and there's even one wire here

552
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:44,770

 

553
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,990

which is kind of weird you have it right

554
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
which is kind of weird you have it right
 

555
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,170
which is kind of weird you have it right
next to it it doesn't work either okay

556
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:56,180
next to it it doesn't work either okay
 

557
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,920
next to it it doesn't work either okay
it does work

558
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:56,930
it does work
 

559
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:05,020
it does work
never mind if you make it too long

560
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,030
never mind if you make it too long
 

561
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,790
never mind if you make it too long
though then I think it works the wire

562
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:08,800
though then I think it works the wire
 

563
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,430
though then I think it works the wire
yeah well if it works if it's right next

564
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
yeah well if it works if it's right next
 

565
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,700
yeah well if it works if it's right next
to it I might have changes

566
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:22,710

 

567
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:33,700

vertical cannon design um got the button
 

573
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,550
vertical cannon design um got the button
here goes to the boosters wraps all

574
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:49,560
here goes to the boosters wraps all
 

575
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,860
here goes to the boosters wraps all
around the boosters and this is a very

576
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:53,870
around the boosters and this is a very
 

577
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,020
around the boosters and this is a very
cheap way of doing a variable timer

578
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,030
cheap way of doing a variable timer
 

579
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,990
cheap way of doing a variable timer
system I'm still going to try do the

580
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
system I'm still going to try do the
 

581
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,050
system I'm still going to try do the
binary method like in either amps timer

582
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,060
binary method like in either amps timer
 

583
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:12,140
binary method like in either amps timer
this torch is off and I haven't tested

584
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,150
this torch is off and I haven't tested
 

585
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,720
this torch is off and I haven't tested
it out yet so this would be ten torches

586
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:17,730
it out yet so this would be ten torches
 

587
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:33,150
it out yet so this would be ten torches
plus two twelve torches

588
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,160

 

589
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,950

come on cow I dare you to hop into the
 

591
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:46,350
come on cow I dare you to hop into the
center and hopefully this isn't blowing

592
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,360
center and hopefully this isn't blowing
 

593
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,030
center and hopefully this isn't blowing
the TNT goes there the torch lights the

594
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,040
the TNT goes there the torch lights the
 

595
00:24:49,040 --> 00:25:08,740
the TNT goes there the torch lights the
TNT and it shoots up hopefully and

596
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:08,750
TNT and it shoots up hopefully and
 

597
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,270
TNT and it shoots up hopefully and
that's the first cannon I've made in

598
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:10,280
that's the first cannon I've made in
 

599
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,760

this LP I guess you should expect to see

600
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:15,770
this LP I guess you should expect to see
 

601
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:25,420
this LP I guess you should expect to see
a lot more of those in the future a and

602
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,430
a lot more of those in the future a and
 

603
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,760
a lot more of those in the future a and
yeah this is a mini cannon it doesn't

604
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:27,770
yeah this is a mini cannon it doesn't
 

605
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,910
yeah this is a mini cannon it doesn't
have a whole lot of power this might

606
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:30,920
have a whole lot of power this might
 

607
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,120
have a whole lot of power this might
actually make it blow up so I've added

608
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,130
actually make it blow up so I've added
 

609
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:52,690
actually make it blow up so I've added
an extra nine torches or 18 ticks - yep

610
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:52,700
an extra nine torches or 18 ticks - yep
 

611
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,230
an extra nine torches or 18 ticks - yep
still in one piece until I fell into it

612
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
still in one piece until I fell into it
 

613
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,700
still in one piece until I fell into it

and hopefully I made the donation link
 

619
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,300
and hopefully I made the donation link
properly I had to take the HTML code for

620
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:16,310
properly I had to take the HTML code for
 

621
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,690

the donation button and I manually

622
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:19,700
the donation button and I manually
 

623
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,320
the donation button and I manually
converted it into a hyperlink so

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,510
to keep making those mob system
 

639
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,430

tutorials and then we'll probably do

640
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,440
