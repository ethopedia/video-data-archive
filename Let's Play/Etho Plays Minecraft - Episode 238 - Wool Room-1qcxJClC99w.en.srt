for some reason okay right that might be

166
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,150
for some reason okay right that might be
 

167
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,190
for some reason okay right that might be
a bug I don't know what to do now

168
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,200
a bug I don't know what to do now
 

169
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,510
a bug I don't know what to do now
ah I must have be problems I don't know

170
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,520
ah I must have be problems I don't know
 

171
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,550
ah I must have be problems I don't know
I don't think I have my way into that

172
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't think I have my way into that
 

173
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think I have my way into that
room anymore either do I maybe this was

174
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,010
room anymore either do I maybe this was
 

175
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,900
room anymore either do I maybe this was
it yeah this is it whoa thought I had a

176
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:43,910
it yeah this is it whoa thought I had a
 

177
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,680
it yeah this is it whoa thought I had a
better way of getting in

178
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,690

 

179
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,880

so obviously the wall didn't fall down

180
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:51,890
so obviously the wall didn't fall down
 

181
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,890
so obviously the wall didn't fall down
otherwise it would have washed down

182
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:53,900
otherwise it would have washed down
 

183
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,720
otherwise it would have washed down
these streams so it's like it can't go

184
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:58,730
these streams so it's like it can't go
 

185
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,150
these streams so it's like it can't go
through the stairs anymore it's very

186
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
through the stairs anymore it's very
 

187
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,020
through the stairs anymore it's very
strange

188
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,030
strange
 

189
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:10,350
strange
I bet you it's because of that whole

190
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,360
I bet you it's because of that whole
 

191
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,390
I bet you it's because of that whole
items and blocks getting transported

192
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,400
items and blocks getting transported
 

193
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,310
items and blocks getting transported
it's considering the stairs as a full

194
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,320
it's considering the stairs as a full
 

195
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:23,409
it's considering the stairs as a full
block let's test that idea maybe okay so

196
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:23,419
block let's test that idea maybe okay so
 

197
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,180
block let's test that idea maybe okay so
this is a setup here we got an upside

198
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,190
this is a setup here we got an upside
 

199
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,360
this is a setup here we got an upside
down stair before an item used people

200
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,370
down stair before an item used people
 

201
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,270
down stair before an item used people
pass through that now it seems like

202
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,280

 

203
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,770

doesn't want to refuses if multiple

204
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:41,780
doesn't want to refuses if multiple
 

205
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,090
doesn't want to refuses if multiple
items go they get clumped together that

206
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,100
items go they get clumped together that
 

207
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,700
items go they get clumped together that
is very strange I pretty sure that's a

208
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:48,710
is very strange I pretty sure that's a
 

209
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,480
is very strange I pretty sure that's a
bug with the snapshots

210

going to start shaping this out what
 

293
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,720
going to start shaping this out what
should it be so we can fit possibly

294
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:35,730
should it be so we can fit possibly
 

295
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,690
should it be so we can fit possibly
eight going across here so we'll have to

296
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:38,700
eight going across here so we'll have to
 

297
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,590
eight going across here so we'll have to
put four per side if we can fit eight so

298
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
put four per side if we can fit eight so
 

299
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,380
put four per side if we can fit eight so
we need this to be nine nine wide by at

300
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,390
we need this to be nine nine wide by at
 

301
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,210
we need this to be nine nine wide by at
least four deep I guess that's pretty

302
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,220
least four deep I guess that's pretty
 

303
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,500
least four deep I guess that's pretty
much cleared out already isn't it okay

304
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,510

 

305
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,660

for the floor

306
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,670

 

307
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,040

we'll try connect that together

308
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,050
we'll try connect that together
 

309
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,870

bit of this actually so one second

322
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:42,620
bit of this actually so one second
 

323
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,900
bit of this actually so one second
alright check this out guys I was

324
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:44,910
alright check this out guys I was
 

325
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,620
alright check this out guys I was
clearing out the land for this and red

326
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:48,630
clearing out the land for this and red
 

327
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,260
clearing out the land for this and red
stone for the sheep farm is right here

328
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,270
stone for the sheep farm is right here
 

329
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,870
stone for the sheep farm is right here
like right right here and there's some

330
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
like right right here and there's some
 

331
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,440
like right right here and there's some
there so the wall was supposed to go

332
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,450
there so the wall was supposed to go
 

333
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,130
there so the wall was supposed to go
here so that works out just perfect

334
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:00,140
here so that works out just perfect
 

335
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,610
here so that works out just perfect
cutting it close

336
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:01,620
cutting it close
 

337
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,910
cutting it close
cutting it very close so I thought you

338
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:04,920
cutting it very close so I thought you
 

339
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,100
cutting it very close so I thought you
know what the sheep farm we got this

340
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,110
know what the sheep farm we got this
 

341
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,950
know what the sheep farm we got this
line of stone brick going around the

342
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:09,960
line of stone brick going around the
 

343
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,630
line of stone brick going around the
bottom and then wood maybe we should do

344
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:11,640
bottom and then wood maybe we should do
 

345
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,800
bottom and then wood maybe we should do
that here to see how that goes so one

346
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:18,810
that here to see how that goes so one
 

347
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,420
that here to see how that goes so one
two three four five might do it like

348
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:23,430
two three four five might do it like
 

349
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,690
two three four five might do it like
that I wanted to have a half slabs on

350
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:26,700
that I wanted to have a half slabs on
 

351
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,910
that I wanted to have a half slabs on
the ground

352
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920

 

353
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,430

although I just you can see full blocks

354
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
although I just you can see full blocks
 

355
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,470
although I just you can see full blocks
yet there can't you might look a little

356
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
yet there can't you might look a little
 

357
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,180
yet there can't you might look a little
weird if we only have half a block

358
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,190
weird if we only have half a block
 

359
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,930
weird if we only have half a block
showing and we got to figure out the

360
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:43,940
showing and we got to figure out the
 

361
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,640
showing and we got to figure out the
layout for the chess and we're going to

362
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:48,650
layout for the chess and we're going to
 

363
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,110
layout for the chess and we're going to
tweak this don't worry this is just the

364
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,120
tweak this don't worry this is just the
 

365
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,950
tweak this don't worry this is just the
rough layout a rough plan so the thing

366
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:53,960
rough layout a rough plan so the thing
 

367
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,150
rough layout a rough plan so the thing
with the chess though it's really it's

368
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
with the chess though it's really it's
 

369
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,270
with the chess though it's really it's
really hard to have lots of unique items

370
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,280
really hard to have lots of unique items
 

371
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,770
really hard to have lots of unique items
going in chess because okay well first

372
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:05,780
going in chess because okay well first
 

373
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,520
going in chess because okay well first
of all we should have some kind of thing

374
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:09,530
of all we should have some kind of thing
 

375
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,500
of all we should have some kind of thing
there to hide the redstone so we should

376
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,510
there to hide the redstone so we should
 

377
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,180
there to hide the redstone so we should
actually make this come out at least one

378
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,190
actually make this come out at least one
 

379
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,060
actually make this come out at least one
more to count for that and then like to

380
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,070
more to count for that and then like to
 

381
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,680
more to count for that and then like to
do chess I think we'd have to stagger

382
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:20,690
do chess I think we'd have to stagger
 

383
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:30,340
do chess I think we'd have to stagger
them um just kind of crummy I guess I

384
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,350
them um just kind of crummy I guess I
 

385
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,210
them um just kind of crummy I guess I
don't know that I might use dispensers

386
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,220
don't know that I might use dispensers
 

387
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,410
don't know that I might use dispensers
because you can put them side by side

388
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:37,420
because you can put them side by side
 

389
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,580
because you can put them side by side
downside is you don't have as much

390
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:39,590
downside is you don't have as much
 

391
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,150
downside is you don't have as much
storage and they're they're not really

392
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,160
storage and they're they're not really
 

393
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,580
storage and they're they're not really
meant for storage

394
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:50,590

 

395
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,270

okay well let's let's trap some wool

396
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,280
okay well let's let's trap some wool
 

397
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,480
okay well let's let's trap some wool
varies colors of wool we're trying to

398
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,490
varies colors of wool we're trying to
 

399
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,550
varies colors of wool we're trying to
figure out the layouts which how should

400
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
figure out the layouts which how should
 

401
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,840
figure out the layouts which how should
we put this so I want to label them too

402
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:04,850
we put this so I want to label them too
 

403
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,310
we put this so I want to label them too
with the color let's pretend we have a

404
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
with the color let's pretend we have a
 

405
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,900
with the color let's pretend we have a
color wheel going around the top that's

406
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:10,910
color wheel going around the top that's
 

407
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,740
color wheel going around the top that's
one option

408
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:11,750
one option
 

409
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,230
one option
doing it like that let's see what it

410
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
doing it like that let's see what it
 

411
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:23,080
doing it like that let's see what it
looks like when we put the wood in yeah

412
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,090
looks like when we put the wood in yeah
 

413
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,090
looks like when we put the wood in yeah
that would be one possible method I

414
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,100
that would be one possible method I
 

415
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,140
that would be one possible method I
don't like that at all no let's try

416
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,150
don't like that at all no let's try
 

417
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,010
don't like that at all no let's try
something else

418
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,020

 

419
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,500

and new noop noop not gonna happen oh I

420
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,510
and new noop noop not gonna happen oh I
 

421
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,850
and new noop noop not gonna happen oh I
can tell I'm gonna have a hard time with

422
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:39,860
can tell I'm gonna have a hard time with
 

423
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,890
can tell I'm gonna have a hard time with
this already ah

424
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:43,900

 

425
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900

hmm well I do like that a little bit
 

427
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,860
hmm well I do like that a little bit
more but it's kind of cluttered I don't

428
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:50,870
more but it's kind of cluttered I don't
 

429
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,140
more but it's kind of cluttered I don't
know not sure if I'm going to be happy

430
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,150
know not sure if I'm going to be happy
 

431

435
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,690
can't do that yeah I like it a little
more I think with the wood above -

436
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:09,700
more I think with the wood above -
 

437
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,310
more I think with the wood above -
although I you know what I'll probably

438
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
although I you know what I'll probably
 

439
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,350
although I you know what I'll probably
put a pattern in the floor like I have

440
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360
put a pattern in the floor like I have
 

441
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,800

spectrum in that it'll look better if
 

479
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,200
spectrum in that it'll look better if
it's not just random colors alright

480
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,210
it's not just random colors alright
 

481
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,850
it's not just random colors alright
we're getting there we're getting there

482
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:24,860
we're getting there we're getting there
 

483
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,800
we're getting there we're getting there
seems a little bit better now

484
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:26,810
seems a little bit better now
 

485
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,030
seems a little bit better now
I also changed it so that these wood

486
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
I also changed it so that these wood
 

487
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,130
I also changed it so that these wood
blocks are actually stairs you can see

488
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,140
blocks are actually stairs you can see
 

489
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,630
blocks are actually stairs you can see
just barely

490
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:34,640
just barely
 

491
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,960
just barely
it's stair from this angle so that means

492
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:37,970
it's stair from this angle so that means
 

493
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,350
it's stair from this angle so that means
we can open the chest same with the odd

494
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,360
we can open the chest same with the odd
 

495
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
we can open the chest same with the odd
it's trying to collect it I wasn't

496

it's trying to collect it I wasn't
 

497
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,140
it's trying to collect it I wasn't
trying to break it same with those

498
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,150
trying to break it same with those
 

499
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,910
trying to break it same with those
blocks I have to go back there and fix

500
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:46,920
blocks I have to go back there and fix
 

501
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,840
blocks I have to go back there and fix
it ah but yeah those are stairs I'd open

502
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:53,850
it ah but yeah those are stairs I'd open
 

503
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,760
it ah but yeah those are stairs I'd open
all the chests got that going I'm not

504
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:58,770
all the chests got that going I'm not
 

505
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,380
all the chests got that going I'm not
liking the leave so so we're going to

506
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,390
liking the leave so so we're going to
 

507
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,620
liking the leave so so we're going to
get rid of them my new plan is to use

508
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:05,630
get rid of them my new plan is to use
 

509
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,020
get rid of them my new plan is to use
lamps because it also feels a little bit

510
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,030
lamps because it also feels a little bit
 

511
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,970
lamps because it also feels a little bit
dark in here it's close to what I want

512
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
dark in here it's close to what I want
 

513
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,480
dark in here it's close to what I want
but not quite so if we get lamps we'll

514
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:20,490
but not quite so if we get lamps we'll
 

515
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,100
but not quite so if we get lamps we'll
get rid of the pumpkins just do that

516
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,110
get rid of the pumpkins just do that
 

517
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,260
get rid of the pumpkins just do that
this might be good

518
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,270
this might be good
 

519
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,950
this might be good
and instead you know what else I would

520
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:33,960
and instead you know what else I would
 

521
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,230
and instead you know what else I would
like maybe have out a ring or a kind of

522
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,240
like maybe have out a ring or a kind of
 

523
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,580
like maybe have out a ring or a kind of
like a half circle of leaves going

524
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,590
like a half circle of leaves going
 

525
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,070
like a half circle of leaves going
around the top here that could look cool

526
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,080
around the top here that could look cool
 

527
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,250
around the top here that could look cool
so we'll try that out too how's that you

528
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,260
so we'll try that out too how's that you
 

529
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,170
so we'll try that out too how's that you
know that lit up the room a little bit

530
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,180
know that lit up the room a little bit
 

531
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,120
know that lit up the room a little bit
more doesn't feel too out of place maybe

532
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,130
more doesn't feel too out of place maybe
 

533
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,810
more doesn't feel too out of place maybe
we want to lamp there too I like it's on

534
00:16:59,810 --> 00:16:59,820
we want to lamp there too I like it's on
 

535
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,640
we want to lamp there too I like it's on
this side if we don't have one there

536
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:01,650
this side if we don't have one there
 

537
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,110
this side if we don't have one there
because then it looks like it connects

538
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
because then it looks like it connects
 

539
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,590
because then it looks like it connects
from here and goes down mm-hmm so I'm

540
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
from here and goes down mm-hmm so I'm
 

541
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,880
from here and goes down mm-hmm so I'm
going to fix that in which I put some

542
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:10,890
going to fix that in which I put some
 

543
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,390
going to fix that in which I put some
leaves

544
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,400
leaves
 

545
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,340
leaves
maybe another line of wood and then a

546
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,350
maybe another line of wood and then a
 

547
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,620
maybe another line of wood and then a
ceiling oh and also I wanted to try this

548
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:18,630
ceiling oh and also I wanted to try this
 

549
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,970
ceiling oh and also I wanted to try this
to kind of make an X here and who knows

550
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:22,980
to kind of make an X here and who knows
 

551
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,780
to kind of make an X here and who knows
that might look cool the idea of this is

552
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:25,790
that might look cool the idea of this is
 

553
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,640
that might look cool the idea of this is
we're going to have the items pop out of

554
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:28,650
we're going to have the items pop out of
 

555
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,100
we're going to have the items pop out of
the floor over here so we're going to

556
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,110
the floor over here so we're going to
 

557
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,700
the floor over here so we're going to
run I'm going to run a nice stream these

558
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:37,710
run I'm going to run a nice stream these
 

559
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,330
run I'm going to run a nice stream these
two sides are going to connect

560
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,340

 

561
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,820

you're going to go to just below that

562
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:43,830
you're going to go to just below that
 

563
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,320
you're going to go to just below that
and then they're going to pop up with a

564
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,330
and then they're going to pop up with a
 

565
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,260
and then they're going to pop up with a
little bit of wiring hopefully that's

566
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,270
little bit of wiring hopefully that's
 

567
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,950
little bit of wiring hopefully that's
the plan

568
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
the plan
 

569
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,920
the plan
where's my sandstone there we go let's

570
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:57,930
where's my sandstone there we go let's
 

571
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,280
where's my sandstone there we go let's
see if we like this

572
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,290

 

573
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,320

another possibility with the items

574
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,330
another possibility with the items
 

575
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,970
another possibility with the items
popping on the ground we might not be

576
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:10,980
popping on the ground we might not be
 

577
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,550
popping on the ground we might not be
will have a half slab there so we could

578
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:16,560
will have a half slab there so we could
 

579
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,800
will have a half slab there so we could
potentially have a lamp there if it

580
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:18,810
potentially have a lamp there if it
 

581
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,900
potentially have a lamp there if it
doesn't let us use a half slab and just

582
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:23,910
doesn't let us use a half slab and just
 

583
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,380
doesn't let us use a half slab and just
have a drop maybe I'm that might be what

584
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,390
have a drop maybe I'm that might be what
 

585
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,110
have a drop maybe I'm that might be what
we do also I was looking at this and

586
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
we do also I was looking at this and
 

587
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,330
we do also I was looking at this and
since we can connect stairs together

588
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
since we can connect stairs together
 

589
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,640
since we can connect stairs together
maybe we should do that so it looks a

590
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,650
maybe we should do that so it looks a
 

591
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,720
maybe we should do that so it looks a
little strange

592
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,730
little strange
 

593
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,930
little strange
my other beef is with this the fences

594
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:44,940
my other beef is with this the fences
 

595
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,120
my other beef is with this the fences
are not connecting to the stairs on both

596
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,130
are not connecting to the stairs on both
 

597
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,550
are not connecting to the stairs on both
sides so we should change that to a full

598
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:49,560
sides so we should change that to a full
 

599
00:18:49,560 --> 00:19:06,190
sides so we should change that to a full
block I think yeah I think that's better

600
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,200

 

601
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,510

I'm not good with this kind of stuff

602
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm not good with this kind of stuff
 

603
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,770
I'm not good with this kind of stuff
guys OOP no I don't want that that's not

604
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:12,780
guys OOP no I don't want that that's not
 

605
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,260
guys OOP no I don't want that that's not
going to connect I know there's a trick

606
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,270
going to connect I know there's a trick
 

607
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,090
going to connect I know there's a trick
to placing them I haven't figured out

608
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,100
to placing them I haven't figured out
 

609
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,550
to placing them I haven't figured out
how do that though but if you place it a

610
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:19,560
how do that though but if you place it a
 

611
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,310
how do that though but if you place it a
certain way oh there we go maybe I have

612
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
certain way oh there we go maybe I have
 

613
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,320
certain way oh there we go maybe I have
figured out the trick this one's

614
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,330
figured out the trick this one's
 

615
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,660
figured out the trick this one's
different to you hmm

616
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:31,670

 

617
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,900

nope nope

618
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:34,910
nope nope
 

619
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,920
nope nope
who anyway I'll fix it up is this good

with that I especially like this the
 

645
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,690
with that I especially like this the
leaves around the top I think that just

646
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:28,700
leaves around the top I think that just
 

647
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,490
leaves around the top I think that just
completes the look this middle little

648
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:33,500
completes the look this middle little
 

649
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,880
completes the look this middle little
part here I tried that let's try it

650
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,890
part here I tried that let's try it
 

651
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,000
part here I tried that let's try it
without the light I'll just put that

652
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,010
without the light I'll just put that
 

653
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,680
without the light I'll just put that
there for now I'll have to go down there

654
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:44,690
there for now I'll have to go down there
 

655
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,980
there for now I'll have to go down there
and fix it anyway without the light it

656
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,990
and fix it anyway without the light it
 

657
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,140
and fix it anyway without the light it
would be like that and without the

658
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,150
would be like that and without the
 

659
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:59,640
would be like that and without the
sandstone mmm not sure about that yeah I

660
00:20:59,640 --> 00:20:59,650
sandstone mmm not sure about that yeah I
 

661
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,300
sandstone mmm not sure about that yeah I
think it turned out

think it turned out
 

663
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,540
think it turned out
oh I rotate it I don't want to rotate it

664
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:04,550
oh I rotate it I don't want to rotate it
 

665
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,580

matches a style so I'm happy about that
yeah projects sort of done so we just

672
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,270
yeah projects sort of done so we just
 

673
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:25,150
yeah projects sort of done so we just
got to do the the piping here although

674
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,160
got to do the the piping here although
 

675
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,700
got to do the the piping here although
yeah you can probably guess on then do

676
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:27,710
yeah you can probably guess on then do
 

677
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,380
yeah you can probably guess on then do
them just gonna run ice and then water

678
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,390
them just gonna run ice and then water
 

679
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,270
them just gonna run ice and then water
streams with signs to hold the water in

680
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,280
streams with signs to hold the water in
 

681
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,430
streams with signs to hold the water in
place and such and then we'll bring it

682
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,440
place and such and then we'll bring it
 

683
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,910
place and such and then we'll bring it
down to over here and I'm guessing I'll

684
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:39,920
down to over here and I'm guessing I'll
 

685
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,460
down to over here and I'm guessing I'll
make its hit a pressure plate which will

686
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,470
make its hit a pressure plate which will
 

687
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:48,100
make its hit a pressure plate which will
move a piston which will put the item in

688
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,110
move a piston which will put the item in
 

689
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,580
move a piston which will put the item in
a block and make it go up that's sort of

690
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,590
a block and make it go up that's sort of
 

691
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,560
a block and make it go up that's sort of
what I'm thinking of doing although I'm

692
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,570
what I'm thinking of doing although I'm
 

693
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,560
what I'm thinking of doing although I'm
running out of time today so we did not

694
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:56,570
running out of time today so we did not
 

695
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,480
running out of time today so we did not
get this done today unfortunately not

696
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,490
get this done today unfortunately not
 

697
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,180
get this done today unfortunately not
totally but we are very very very very

698
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,190
totally but we are very very very very
 

699
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,820
totally but we are very very very very
close and it's all stuff I think I could

700
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:03,830
close and it's all stuff I think I could
 

701
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:11,140
close and it's all stuff I think I could
do on my own so cool uh yeah that that

702
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,150
do on my own so cool uh yeah that that
 

703
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,030
do on my own so cool uh yeah that that
bug with this too is kind of holding me

704
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,040
bug with this too is kind of holding me
 

705
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,150
bug with this too is kind of holding me
back so I think I'll wait on that

706
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,160
back so I think I'll wait on that
 

707
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,010
back so I think I'll wait on that
hopefully it gets fixed and if not I'll

708
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,020
hopefully it gets fixed and if not I'll
 

709
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,700
hopefully it gets fixed and if not I'll
fix I'll I'll switch to half slabs now

710
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:21,710
fix I'll I'll switch to half slabs now
 

711
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,560
fix I'll I'll switch to half slabs now
we have these little areas here these

712
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,570
we have these little areas here these
 

713
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,510
we have these little areas here these
things that we need to finish there's

714
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
things that we need to finish there's
 

715
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,170
things that we need to finish there's
one there and there's one here I thought

716
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,180
one there and there's one here I thought
 

717
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,920
one there and there's one here I thought
you know might be cool if I plant wheat

718
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:32,930
you know might be cool if I plant wheat
 

719
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:40,420
you know might be cool if I plant wheat
here change that to dirt hide some water

720
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,430
here change that to dirt hide some water
 

721
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,580
here change that to dirt hide some water
somewhere plant wheats we'll see what

722
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:42,590
somewhere plant wheats we'll see what
 

723
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,180
somewhere plant wheats we'll see what
that looks like

724
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,190
that looks like
 

725
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,100
that looks like
although on this side I have a problem

726
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,110
although on this side I have a problem
 

727
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,060
although on this side I have a problem
with the repeaters I don't know what to

728
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,070
with the repeaters I don't know what to
 

729

with the repeaters I don't know what to
do about that these eggs man they're

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:04,810

 

739
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,720

who knew it would be so tough has me a

740
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:09,730
who knew it would be so tough has me a
 

741
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,340

little worried about this too that the

742
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,350
little worried about this too that the
 

743
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,050
little worried about this too that the
wool is not going to fly straight up

744

wool is not going to fly straight up
 

745
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,520
wool is not going to fly straight up
it's going all over the place maybe

746
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,530
it's going all over the place maybe
 

747
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,930
it's going all over the place maybe
although it's only four or five blocks

748
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:17,940
although it's only four or five blocks
 

749
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,790
although it's only four or five blocks
that I got to move it up so it can't

750
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:20,800
that I got to move it up so it can't
 

751
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,400
that I got to move it up so it can't
scatter too far from that yeah I went

752
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,410
scatter too far from that yeah I went
 

753
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,470
scatter too far from that yeah I went
through here and I did some cleanup so I

754
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
through here and I did some cleanup so I
 

755
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,730
through here and I did some cleanup so I
got rid of the chests that were in the

756
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:29,740
got rid of the chests that were in the
 

757
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,880
got rid of the chests that were in the
way I changed this door I don't know if

758
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:32,890
way I changed this door I don't know if
 

759
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,510
way I changed this door I don't know if
you notice this but I used to have

760
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
you notice this but I used to have
 

761
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,560
you notice this but I used to have
through torches here well there and I

762
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:40,570
through torches here well there and I
 

763
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,510
through torches here well there and I
had some Pistons that were letting light

764
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,520
had some Pistons that were letting light
 

765
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,780
had some Pistons that were letting light
through down there now I got lamps and

766
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,790
through down there now I got lamps and
 

767
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,380
through down there now I got lamps and
they light up a lot better I don't know

768
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,390
they light up a lot better I don't know
 

769
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,310
they light up a lot better I don't know
they really fit but seems to be a better

770
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,320
they really fit but seems to be a better
 

771
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,300
they really fit but seems to be a better
better way of lighting place for sure

772
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,310
better way of lighting place for sure
 

773
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,480
better way of lighting place for sure
because without them it drops below a

774
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,490
because without them it drops below a
 

775
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,130
because without them it drops below a
light level eight here so mobs could

776
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,140
light level eight here so mobs could
 

777
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,750
light level eight here so mobs could
potentially spawn which is a bad thing

778
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
potentially spawn which is a bad thing
 

779
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,820
potentially spawn which is a bad thing
actually I noticed here too there's a

780
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:05,830
actually I noticed here too there's a
 

781
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,040
actually I noticed here too there's a
level level seven spot right there which

782
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,050
level level seven spot right there which
 

783
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,220
level level seven spot right there which
is a little bit of a problem but yeah I

784
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,230
is a little bit of a problem but yeah I
 

785
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,440
is a little bit of a problem but yeah I
got the wheats on this side I think it's

786
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,450
got the wheats on this side I think it's
 

787
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,690
got the wheats on this side I think it's
a pretty good addition and I want to do

788
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:18,700
a pretty good addition and I want to do
 

789
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,040
a pretty good addition and I want to do
it over here but we have the repeater

790
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,050
it over here but we have the repeater
 

791
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,990
it over here but we have the repeater
but I was looking at it and I might be

792
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,000
but I was looking at it and I might be
 

793
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,220
but I was looking at it and I might be
able to move that thankfully this door

794
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,230
able to move that thankfully this door
 

795
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,440
able to move that thankfully this door
design wasn't all that compact so I can

796
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,450
design wasn't all that compact so I can
 

797
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,380
design wasn't all that compact so I can
tweak it a little bit I think if I

798
