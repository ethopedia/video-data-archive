00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:36,919
episode so I just put chests here these
 

161
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,540
episode so I just put chests here these
are actually supposed to be droppers so

162
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:40,550
are actually supposed to be droppers so
 

163
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,470
are actually supposed to be droppers so
i deceived you a little bit the other

164
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,480
i deceived you a little bit the other
 

165
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,900
i deceived you a little bit the other
goal of this thing though is to have an

166
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:46,910
goal of this thing though is to have an
 

167
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,540
goal of this thing though is to have an
automatic retrieval system so you can

168
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:49,550
automatic retrieval system so you can
 

169
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,480
automatic retrieval system so you can
request items out of the storage room

170
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,490
request items out of the storage room
 

171
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,189
request items out of the storage room
without having to go into

172
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
without having to go into
 

173
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,280
without having to go into
which is going to be complicating

174
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,290
which is going to be complicating
 

175
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,879
which is going to be complicating
because there's going to be 256

176
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:02,889
because there's going to be 256
 

177
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,280
because there's going to be 256
different items in here how do you pick

178
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,290
different items in here how do you pick
 

179
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,560
different items in here how do you pick
which one you want and how do you get it

180
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,570
which one you want and how do you get it
 

181
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,500
which one you want and how do you get it
out like you can get items out of a

182
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:10,510
out like you can get items out of a
 

183
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,219
out like you can get items out of a
chest using a hopper and a and a dropper

184
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:14,229
chest using a hopper and a and a dropper
 

185
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,930
chest using a hopper and a and a dropper
right but how do you pick it so that is

186
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:18,940
right but how do you pick it so that is
 

187
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,090
right but how do you pick it so that is
that is the big challenge what we're

188
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,100
that is the big challenge what we're
 

189
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,260
that is the big challenge what we're
going to do we're going to be setting up

190
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,270
going to do we're going to be setting up
 

191
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,070
going to do we're going to be setting up
some kind of thing like this at the main

192
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,080
some kind of thing like this at the main
 

193
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,040
some kind of thing like this at the main
command room and depending on the

194
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,050
command room and depending on the
 

195
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,800
command room and depending on the
different combination of these levers

196
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:33,810
different combination of these levers
 

197
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,510
different combination of these levers
each one of these is like a bit so

198
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
each one of these is like a bit so
 

199
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,420
each one of these is like a bit so
there's 256 different combinations you

200
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,430
there's 256 different combinations you
 

201
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,210
there's 256 different combinations you
can do depending on how these levers are

202
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,220
can do depending on how these levers are
 

203
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,240
can do depending on how these levers are
arranged like maybe some are down some

204
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,250
arranged like maybe some are down some
 

205
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,390
arranged like maybe some are down some
are up and you would select which item

206
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
are up and you would select which item
 

207
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,090
are up and you would select which item
you want that way out of the 256 then

208
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,100
you want that way out of the 256 then
 

209
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,320
you want that way out of the 256 then
hit a button for requesting that item

210
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,330
hit a button for requesting that item
 

211
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,340
hit a button for requesting that item
they'll probably be a few different

212
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,350
they'll probably be a few different
 

213
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,870
they'll probably be a few different
options for how many items you want and

214
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:57,880
options for how many items you want and
 

215
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,700
options for how many items you want and
it's going to send a bunch of pulses to

216
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,710
it's going to send a bunch of pulses to
 

217
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,190
it's going to send a bunch of pulses to
the proper dropper down there we'll

218
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,200
the proper dropper down there we'll
 

219
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,080
the proper dropper down there we'll
probably also have some kind of chart

220
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,090
probably also have some kind of chart
 

221
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,620
probably also have some kind of chart
over over here explaining which item is

222
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:10,630
over over here explaining which item is
 

223
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,170
over over here explaining which item is
what with the combination because

224
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,180
what with the combination because
 

225
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,350
what with the combination because
there's no way I can remember 256

226
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,360
there's no way I can remember 256
 

227
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,300
there's no way I can remember 256
different combinations and what item is

228
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,310
different combinations and what item is
 

229
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,029
different combinations and what item is
what so we'll need some organizational

230
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
what so we'll need some organizational
 

231
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,650
what so we'll need some organizational
system to it too um but I'll tell you

232
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:25,660
system to it too um but I'll tell you
 

233
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,240
system to it too um but I'll tell you
what I'm going to start moving this

234
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,250
what I'm going to start moving this
 

235
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,250
what I'm going to start moving this
stuff down here and then I'll show you

236
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,260
stuff down here and then I'll show you
 

237
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,219
stuff down here and then I'll show you
how we will be able to control the the

238
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:32,229
how we will be able to control the the
 

239
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,350
how we will be able to control the the
droppers and there we go so I cleared

240
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
droppers and there we go so I cleared
 

241
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,420
droppers and there we go so I cleared
out some more space got these droppers

242
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,430
out some more space got these droppers
 

243
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,370
out some more space got these droppers
in place this is probably their official

244
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:41,380
in place this is probably their official
 

245
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,439
in place this is probably their official
position now there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of

246
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,449
position now there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of
 

247
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,629
position now there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of
them 8 times 4 is 32

248
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
them 8 times 4 is 32
 

249
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,510
them 8 times 4 is 32
that's 1/8 of our total storage room

250
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
that's 1/8 of our total storage room
 

251
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,800
that's 1/8 of our total storage room
over here and I am going to show you how

252
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:55,810
over here and I am going to show you how
 

253
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,420
over here and I am going to show you how
I'm going to start wiring up the

254
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm going to start wiring up the
 

255
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm going to start wiring up the
retrieval system so how we're going to

256
00:06:59,640 --> 00:06:59,650
retrieval system so how we're going to
 

257
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,370
retrieval system so how we're going to
do the binary the bits so yeah it's

258
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:05,380
do the binary the bits so yeah it's
 

259
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,890
do the binary the bits so yeah it's
basically yes or no

260
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:07,900
basically yes or no
 

261
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,219
basically yes or no
we trigger this dropper or not and the

262
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:11,229
we trigger this dropper or not and the
 

263
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,020
we trigger this dropper or not and the
easiest way of doing that in Minecraft

264
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,030
easiest way of doing that in Minecraft
 

265
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,710
easiest way of doing that in Minecraft
that I found is to use sideways sticky

266
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
that I found is to use sideways sticky
 

267
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,760
that I found is to use sideways sticky
pistons I think I think some of the more

268
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:20,770
pistons I think I think some of the more
 

269
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,219
pistons I think I think some of the more
like computer redstone guys might know

270
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:23,229
like computer redstone guys might know
 

271
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,830
like computer redstone guys might know
more about this than me but this is how

272
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
more about this than me but this is how
 

273
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,159
more about this than me but this is how
I'm going to do it and I decide to space

274
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:29,169
I'm going to do it and I decide to space
 

275
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,350
I'm going to do it and I decide to space
these three blocks apart instead of just

276
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
these three blocks apart instead of just
 

277
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,170
these three blocks apart instead of just
one so that we can have more details to

278
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,180
one so that we can have more details to
 

279
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,810
one so that we can have more details to
the build like aesthetic details and

280
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:36,820
the build like aesthetic details and
 

281
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,430
the build like aesthetic details and
also it's going to make the redstone so

282
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,440
also it's going to make the redstone so
 

283
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,790
also it's going to make the redstone so
much easier and efficient because I can

284
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:41,800
much easier and efficient because I can
 

285
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,950
much easier and efficient because I can
get rid of like eight repeaters per

286
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:43,960
get rid of like eight repeaters per
 

287
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,050
get rid of like eight repeaters per
section or something crazy so I kind of

288
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,060
section or something crazy so I kind of
 

289
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,730
section or something crazy so I kind of
need to like make a circuit board almost

290
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:52,740
need to like make a circuit board almost
 

291
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,260
need to like make a circuit board almost
so much redstone is going to be involved

292
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,270
so much redstone is going to be involved
 

293
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,080
so much redstone is going to be involved
in this so these these sticky pistons

294
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,090
in this so these these sticky pistons
 

295
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,950
in this so these these sticky pistons
here are all part of one bit one of

296
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:01,960
here are all part of one bit one of
 

297
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,050
here are all part of one bit one of
those levers over there this is like the

298
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,060
those levers over there this is like the
 

299
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,879
those levers over there this is like the
high bit or the little bit I forget what

300
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:05,889
high bit or the little bit I forget what
 

301
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,529
high bit or the little bit I forget what
it's called exactly but there's going to

302
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:10,539
it's called exactly but there's going to
 

303
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,920
it's called exactly but there's going to
be 128 for this bit the next bit there

304
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:13,930
be 128 for this bit the next bit there
 

305
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,060
be 128 for this bit the next bit there
will be 64 Pistons in the next one 32

306
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,070
will be 64 Pistons in the next one 32
 

307
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,750
will be 64 Pistons in the next one 32
and 16 it gets progressively less it's

308
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:21,760
and 16 it gets progressively less it's
 

309
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,020
and 16 it gets progressively less it's
like we're building a pyramid type of

310
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,030
like we're building a pyramid type of
 

311
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,670
like we're building a pyramid type of
thing I don't know it's hard to explain

312
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,680
thing I don't know it's hard to explain
 

313
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,629
thing I don't know it's hard to explain
basically we will have a row of

314
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
basically we will have a row of
 

315
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,940
basically we will have a row of
repeaters then the next bit would start

316
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:32,950
repeaters then the next bit would start
 

317
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,490
repeaters then the next bit would start
somewhere here not exactly sure how to

318
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:38,500
somewhere here not exactly sure how to
 

319
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:49,350
somewhere here not exactly sure how to
do it maybe like this and this it

320
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
do it maybe like this and this it
 

321
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,550
do it maybe like this and this it
doesn't really matter if they're not

322
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
doesn't really matter if they're not
 

323
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,940
doesn't really matter if they're not
exactly the same timing I do have to

324
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:53,950
exactly the same timing I do have to
 

325
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,980
exactly the same timing I do have to
make sure I don't set my repeaters

326
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:55,990
make sure I don't set my repeaters
 

327
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,380
make sure I don't set my repeaters
longer than one tick though and I can't

328
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,390
longer than one tick though and I can't
 

329
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,540
longer than one tick though and I can't
use redstone torches when I when I do

330
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,550
use redstone torches when I when I do
 

331
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,730
use redstone torches when I when I do
this as sort of a limitation that we

332
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:02,740
this as sort of a limitation that we
 

333
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,070
this as sort of a limitation that we
have to follow because I'm going to be

334
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,080
have to follow because I'm going to be
 

335
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,590
have to follow because I'm going to be
using a rapid pulsing clock to get the

336
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
using a rapid pulsing clock to get the
 

337
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,190
using a rapid pulsing clock to get the
items out of here and if it's a long

338
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
items out of here and if it's a long
 

339
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,930
items out of here and if it's a long
delay on that it's going to take forever

340
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:12,940
delay on that it's going to take forever
 

341
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,000
delay on that it's going to take forever
to get our items so we have to make it

342
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,010
to get our items so we have to make it
 

343
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,400
to get our items so we have to make it
as quick as possible um I think we do

344
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,410
as quick as possible um I think we do
 

345
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,660
as quick as possible um I think we do
something like this then

346
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:21,670
something like this then
 

347
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,670
something like this then
and yeah it kind of makes a pyramid so

348
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
and yeah it kind of makes a pyramid so
 

349
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,030
and yeah it kind of makes a pyramid so
here let me show you if I power this

350
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
here let me show you if I power this
 

351
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,350
here let me show you if I power this
it's going to branch off to the right

352
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
it's going to branch off to the right
 

353
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,060
it's going to branch off to the right
only because that's where this block is

354
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,070
only because that's where this block is
 

355
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,940
only because that's where this block is
if the block was or if this bit was

356
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:35,950
if the block was or if this bit was
 

357
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,150
if the block was or if this bit was
active it would switch to the left and

358
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
active it would switch to the left and
 

359
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
active it would switch to the left and
it would go to here and then it only

360
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,050
it would go to here and then it only
 

361
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,860
it would go to here and then it only
goes to this dropper because the block

362
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:43,870
goes to this dropper because the block
 

363
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,430
goes to this dropper because the block
is not over here right so here I'll put

364
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
is not over here right so here I'll put
 

365
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,390
is not over here right so here I'll put
up a cobblestone and I sin how about

366
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,400
up a cobblestone and I sin how about
 

367
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:58,620
up a cobblestone and I sin how about
that so oh yeah so if I click this only

368
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:58,630
that so oh yeah so if I click this only
 

369
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,570
that so oh yeah so if I click this only
one of the four droppers are going to

370
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:00,580
one of the four droppers are going to
 

371
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,130
one of the four droppers are going to
get activated it was that one there if I

372
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,140
get activated it was that one there if I
 

373
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,580
get activated it was that one there if I
extend this cobblestone gets triggered

374
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:07,590
extend this cobblestone gets triggered
 

375
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,350
extend this cobblestone gets triggered
if I power this it's going to switch to

376
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,360
if I power this it's going to switch to
 

377
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,080
if I power this it's going to switch to
ice like that ah so the other thing we

378
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,090
ice like that ah so the other thing we
 

379
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:22,230
ice like that ah so the other thing we
got to do underneath all of these we

380
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
got to do underneath all of these we
 

381
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,500
got to do underneath all of these we
will need to connect the one of those

382
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,510
will need to connect the one of those
 

383
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,240
will need to connect the one of those
levers hmm tell you what I'll do it off

384
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,250
levers hmm tell you what I'll do it off
 

385
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,580
levers hmm tell you what I'll do it off
camera the eye I don't want to spend too

386
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:32,590
camera the eye I don't want to spend too
 

387
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,050
camera the eye I don't want to spend too
much time on this today I want to do a

388
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,060
much time on this today I want to do a
 

389
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,400
much time on this today I want to do a
few other projects but I thought we

390
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,410
few other projects but I thought we
 

391
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,350
few other projects but I thought we
would just kind of look into it a little

392
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
would just kind of look into it a little
 

393
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,970
would just kind of look into it a little
bit

394
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:37,980
bit
 

395
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,010
bit
aha so check this out guys when I pull

396
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,020
aha so check this out guys when I pull
 

397
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,890
aha so check this out guys when I pull
this lever now it does this but uh so

398
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:46,900
this lever now it does this but uh so
 

399
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,530
this lever now it does this but uh so
this isn't super complicated redstone or

400
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:49,540
this isn't super complicated redstone or
 

401
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,760
this isn't super complicated redstone or
anything it's actually really simple

402
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:50,770
anything it's actually really simple
 

403
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,800
anything it's actually really simple
it's gonna line the redstone running

404
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:52,810
it's gonna line the redstone running
 

405
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,040
it's gonna line the redstone running
underneath each of the pistons and

406
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,050
underneath each of the pistons and
 

407
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,690
underneath each of the pistons and
depending on if this is powered or not

408
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:57,700
depending on if this is powered or not
 

409
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,390
depending on if this is powered or not
it switches between the different

410
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,400
it switches between the different
 

411
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,190
it switches between the different
droppers right it chooses which one to

412
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,200
droppers right it chooses which one to
 

413
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,930
droppers right it chooses which one to
pick and for this first line there's 128

414
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:06,940
pick and for this first line there's 128
 

415
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,870
pick and for this first line there's 128
sticky pistons then the second line 64

416
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:09,880
sticky pistons then the second line 64
 

417
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,530
sticky pistons then the second line 64
32 16 and it just chooses which branch

418
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:13,540
32 16 and it just chooses which branch
 

419
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,620
32 16 and it just chooses which branch
to take as we make our way through it

420
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,630
to take as we make our way through it
 

421
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,310
to take as we make our way through it
right so to actually connect this to our

422
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
right so to actually connect this to our
 

423
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,920
right so to actually connect this to our
control panel very simple all I got to

424
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:22,930
control panel very simple all I got to
 

425
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,230
control panel very simple all I got to
do is connect one of these bits to this

426
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
do is connect one of these bits to this
 

427
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,570
do is connect one of these bits to this
first line of sticky pistons is like

428
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:30,580
first line of sticky pistons is like
 

429
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,650
first line of sticky pistons is like
right to this all you got to do

430
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
right to this all you got to do
 

431
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,240
right to this all you got to do
the second lever up there I would

432
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,250
the second lever up there I would
 

433
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,220
the second lever up there I would
connect to the second line of sticky

434
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,230
connect to the second line of sticky
 

435
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,930
connect to the second line of sticky
pistons let's get our ender pearls this

436
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:41,940
pistons let's get our ender pearls this
 

437
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,540
pistons let's get our ender pearls this
one here where there's half as many and

438
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,550
one here where there's half as many and
 

439
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,850
one here where there's half as many and
half as many past that so it gets easier

440
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:46,860
half as many past that so it gets easier
 

441
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,190
half as many past that so it gets easier
and easier um and yeah by doing that we

442
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,200
and easier um and yeah by doing that we
 

443
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,060
and easier um and yeah by doing that we
can choose exactly hey guy

444
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,070
can choose exactly hey guy
 

445
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,490
can choose exactly hey guy
exactly which dropper we want using

446
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:58,500
exactly which dropper we want using
 

447
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,090
exactly which dropper we want using
those eight levers up there um but I

448
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,100
those eight levers up there um but I
 

449
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,710
those eight levers up there um but I
kind of used up all the redstone I had

450
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:03,720
kind of used up all the redstone I had
 

451
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,230
kind of used up all the redstone I had
on me and even though we've collected a

452
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
on me and even though we've collected a
 

453
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,050
on me and even though we've collected a
bunch over at our at our area there our

454
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,060
bunch over at our at our area there our
 

455
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,970
bunch over at our at our area there our
Nexus Fund I think we should do

456
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:10,980
Nexus Fund I think we should do
 

457
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,070
Nexus Fund I think we should do
something else today okay so we are

458
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,080
something else today okay so we are
 

459

wanted me to set up some scarecrows

464
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:25,500
wanted me to set up some scarecrows
 

465
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
wanted me to set up some scarecrows
maybe we'll do that so we'll head over

466

481
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,620
know if we'll need it and I was thinking
what should we put the stick scarecrows

482
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:48,630

494
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:11,810
alright and just make a few quickly and
 

495
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,050
alright and just make a few quickly and
that's not the recipe is it no what did

496
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,060
that's not the recipe is it no what did
 

497
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,920
that's not the recipe is it no what did
I do wrong again

498
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:15,930
I do wrong again
 

499
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,640
I do wrong again

Oh move it up there we go sweet I
 

501
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,670
Oh move it up there we go sweet I
haven't made too many of them yet I've

502
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:22,680
haven't made too many of them yet I've
 

503
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,710
haven't made too many of them yet I've
been distracted by all kinds of things I

504
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
been distracted by all kinds of things I
 

505
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,950
been distracted by all kinds of things I
wanted to use them more so maybe we will

506
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:30,960
wanted to use them more so maybe we will
 

507
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:38,410
wanted to use them more so maybe we will
put one now let's put one over here so

508
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,420

 

509
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,970

and I don't want to jump I'll trample it

510
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:40,980
and I don't want to jump I'll trample it
 

511
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,770
and I don't want to jump I'll trample it
crops let's see if I just place it

512
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:42,780
crops let's see if I just place it
 

513
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,760
crops let's see if I just place it
straight on it

514
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,770
straight on it
 

515
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,190
straight on it
ah I fell through darn it

516
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,200
ah I fell through darn it
 

517
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,690
ah I fell through darn it
and I'd yield the crop and it like

518
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:49,700
and I'd yield the crop and it like
 

519
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,790
and I'd yield the crop and it like
jumped off somewhere did I get it back I

520
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:51,800
jumped off somewhere did I get it back I
 

521
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,670
jumped off somewhere did I get it back I
think I did okay we probably need a

522
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:54,680
think I did okay we probably need a
 

523
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,100
think I did okay we probably need a
block then and I'm gonna have to trample

524
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,110
block then and I'm gonna have to trample
 

525
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,630
block then and I'm gonna have to trample
him there we go

526
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:01,640
him there we go
 

527
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,960
him there we go
now if I drop it is it gonna stay oh

528
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:06,970

 

529
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,430

that's not good it's floating um dad

530
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,440
that's not good it's floating um dad
 

531
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,910

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
pumped you in chest piece for sure right
 

533
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,780
pumped you in chest piece for sure right
how's that look probably shouldn't be

534
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,790
how's that look probably shouldn't be
 

535
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,510
how's that look probably shouldn't be
floating right I'm not sure um Oh

that was spooky let's try pants just to

538
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:30,950
that was spooky let's try pants just to
 

539
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,290
that was spooky let's try pants just to
see scarecrows usually have pants don't

540
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,300
see scarecrows usually have pants don't
 

541
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,860
see scarecrows usually have pants don't
they I think they'd do maybe not

542
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:40,870
they I think they'd do maybe not
 

543
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,830
they I think they'd do maybe not
um it looks kind of goofy okay how about

544
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:47,840
um it looks kind of goofy okay how about
 

545
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,460
um it looks kind of goofy okay how about
this

546
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:48,470
this
 

547
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,690
this
we'll give them a red plaid shirt and

548
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:51,700
we'll give them a red plaid shirt and
 

549
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,440
we'll give them a red plaid shirt and
blue jeans ah that's what I think of

550
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,450
blue jeans ah that's what I think of
 

551
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,790
blue jeans ah that's what I think of
when I think it was stripped row anyway

552
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:57,800
when I think it was stripped row anyway
 

553
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,610
when I think it was stripped row anyway
there's lots of different types though

554
00:14:59,610 --> 00:14:59,620
there's lots of different types though
 

555
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,230
there's lots of different types though
and we'll sit him on a hay bale maybe

556
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
and we'll sit him on a hay bale maybe
 

557
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,760
and we'll sit him on a hay bale maybe
and see what this looks like do that

558
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:06,770
and see what this looks like do that
 

559
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:14,710
and see what this looks like do that
okay yeah I like that more I think yeah

560
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
okay yeah I like that more I think yeah
 

561

so I made three of them this guy this

564
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:21,740
so I made three of them this guy this
 

565
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,079
so I made three of them this guy this
one and

566
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,089
one and
 

567
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,310
one and
where's the other guy oh he's turned

568
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
where's the other guy oh he's turned
 

569
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,860
where's the other guy oh he's turned
around he's over there they're pretty

570
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:30,870
around he's over there they're pretty
 

571
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,439
around he's over there they're pretty
cool I like them good suggestion

572
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:33,449

everybody that suggested them I like it
 

575
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,470
everybody that suggested them I like it
so next up I'm going to attempt to make

576
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,480
so next up I'm going to attempt to make
 

577
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,889
so next up I'm going to attempt to make
some custom trees along our path here

578
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:41,899
some custom trees along our path here
 

579
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,810
some custom trees along our path here
which is something I don't have a lot of

580
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:44,820
which is something I don't have a lot of
 

581
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,639
which is something I don't have a lot of
experience with let's see I will maybe

582
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:49,649
experience with let's see I will maybe
 

583
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,170
experience with let's see I will maybe
build one I'm going to build one here to

584
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,180
build one I'm going to build one here to
 

585
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,930
build one I'm going to build one here to
start off with just like short 2x2 trees

586
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:56,940
start off with just like short 2x2 trees
 

587
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:06,470
start off with just like short 2x2 trees
and hopefully they turn out good this is

588
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
and hopefully they turn out good this is
 

589
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,030
and hopefully they turn out good this is
tougher than I thought I'm having a

590
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,040
tougher than I thought I'm having a
 

591
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,730
tougher than I thought I'm having a
little bit of trouble but I'll keep

592
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:10,740
little bit of trouble but I'll keep
 

593
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,019
little bit of trouble but I'll keep
working on it

594
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:14,029

 

595
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:16,460

it's a little thin on the side I'm

596
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,470
it's a little thin on the side I'm
 

597
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,100
it's a little thin on the side I'm
hoping if I just BAM leaves around it's

598
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,110
hoping if I just BAM leaves around it's
 

599
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,639
hoping if I just BAM leaves around it's
gonna look good it might be a bit of an

600
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:22,649
gonna look good it might be a bit of an
 

601
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:28,240
gonna look good it might be a bit of an
optimistic outlook but I guess we'll see

602
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,250
optimistic outlook but I guess we'll see
 

603
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,730
optimistic outlook but I guess we'll see
cuz either supposed to be branches and

604
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:33,740
cuz either supposed to be branches and
 

605
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,100
cuz either supposed to be branches and
yeah I guess we'll see what it turns out

606
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,110
yeah I guess we'll see what it turns out
 

607
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,250
yeah I guess we'll see what it turns out
like and there we go guys that is the

608
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,260
like and there we go guys that is the
 

609
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,460
like and there we go guys that is the
finished product that is how I'm gonna

610
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,470
finished product that is how I'm gonna
 

611
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:55,460
finished product that is how I'm gonna
leave it get it leave it leaves ah ah I

612
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,470
leave it get it leave it leaves ah ah I
 

613
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,199
leave it get it leave it leaves ah ah I
had a bit of trouble building it I

614
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,209
had a bit of trouble building it I
 

615
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,309
had a bit of trouble building it I
thought it was going to be easier than

616
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:58,319
thought it was going to be easier than
 

617
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,949
thought it was going to be easier than
it was about I guess it's one of those

618
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
it was about I guess it's one of those
 

619
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,689
it was about I guess it's one of those
things I'm going to have to practice and

620
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:02,699
things I'm going to have to practice and
 

621
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,579
things I'm going to have to practice and
I added all these little droopy leaves

622
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:04,589
I added all these little droopy leaves
 

623
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,829
I added all these little droopy leaves
on it because it looked pretty pretty

624
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
on it because it looked pretty pretty
 

625
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,270
on it because it looked pretty pretty
flat without them from a distance I

626
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280

 

627
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,559

think it's okay I tried to build it up

628
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:15,569
think it's okay I tried to build it up
 

629
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,939
think it's okay I tried to build it up
quite a bit it's it's like hundreds and

630
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:19,949
