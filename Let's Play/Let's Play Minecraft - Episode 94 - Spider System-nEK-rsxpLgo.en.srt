00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,839
spelunking came across something coolant
that show it to you start off the

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,550
episode for today least I think it's
cool

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560

 

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,790

I had one of those like wow moments in

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:25,800
I had one of those like wow moments in
 

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,740
I had one of those like wow moments in
Minecraft as soon as I saw this that

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:27,750
Minecraft as soon as I saw this that
 

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,979
Minecraft as soon as I saw this that
epic cave music played too and it was

16
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:30,989
epic cave music played too and it was
 

17
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,260
epic cave music played too and it was
just perfect alright guys we're back in

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,270
just perfect alright guys we're back in
 

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,720
just perfect alright guys we're back in
her lab here I had a pretty good haul I

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:38,730
her lab here I had a pretty good haul I
 

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,400
her lab here I had a pretty good haul I
think I got about 15 more diamonds and I

22
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,410
think I got about 15 more diamonds and I
 

23
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,860
think I got about 15 more diamonds and I
mean it was close to 10 stacks of

24
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:45,870
mean it was close to 10 stacks of
 

25
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,130
mean it was close to 10 stacks of
redstone I was really happy about that

26
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,140
redstone I was really happy about that
 

27
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,610
redstone I was really happy about that
three stacks

28
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,620
three stacks
 

29
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,600
three stacks
I earned a bunch of gold bunch of lapis

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:55,610
I earned a bunch of gold bunch of lapis
 

31
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,410
I earned a bunch of gold bunch of lapis
lapis yeah and yeah so our mission for

32
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420
lapis yeah and yeah so our mission for
 

33
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,800
lapis yeah and yeah so our mission for
today is to start working on our spider

34
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,810
today is to start working on our spider
 

35
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,890
today is to start working on our spider
system spider spawning system so if

36
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:09,900
system spider spawning system so if
 

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,109
system spider spawning system so if
you're unfamiliar with the concept I'll

38
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
you're unfamiliar with the concept I'll
 

39
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,740
you're unfamiliar with the concept I'll
run it down for you basically you need a

40
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:15,750
run it down for you basically you need a
 

41
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,070
run it down for you basically you need a
solid block with an airspace above then

42
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
solid block with an airspace above then
 

43
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,060
solid block with an airspace above then
above that airspace you need a glass

44
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
above that airspace you need a glass
 

45
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,999
above that airspace you need a glass
block this is a robotic oz figured out

46
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:28,009
block this is a robotic oz figured out
 

47
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,489
block this is a robotic oz figured out
and now Derek Lee will blow this glass

48
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:31,499
and now Derek Lee will blow this glass
 

49
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,700
and now Derek Lee will blow this glass
if it was dark a spider would be able to

50
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:34,710
if it was dark a spider would be able to
 

51
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,550
if it was dark a spider would be able to
spawn there but nolde call mobs would be

52
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
spawn there but nolde call mobs would be
 

53
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,200
spawn there but nolde call mobs would be
able to because it's glass is in the way

54
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,210
able to because it's glass is in the way
 

55
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,459
able to because it's glass is in the way
so it's a pretty cool trick and with

56
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:43,469
so it's a pretty cool trick and with
 

57
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,919
so it's a pretty cool trick and with
that we can make a spider only spawning

58
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:45,929
that we can make a spider only spawning
 

59
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,590
that we can make a spider only spawning
system and that's what we're gonna be

60
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
system and that's what we're gonna be
 

61
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,349
system and that's what we're gonna be
doing today and so I've looked around

62
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:51,359
doing today and so I've looked around
 

63
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,980
doing today and so I've looked around
I've seen a lot of people's spider

64
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:54,990
I've seen a lot of people's spider
 

65
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,929
I've seen a lot of people's spider
systems they've been making like docum

66
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
systems they've been making like docum
 

67
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,459
systems they've been making like docum
for example has made a pretty cool thing

68
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:00,469
for example has made a pretty cool thing
 

69
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,840
for example has made a pretty cool thing
everybody seems to be making a spider

70
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:02,850
everybody seems to be making a spider
 

71
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,120
everybody seems to be making a spider
switching options which are really cool

72
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,130
switching options which are really cool
 

73
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,980
switching options which are really cool
they allow you to have only spiders or

74
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:08,990
they allow you to have only spiders or
 

75
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,990
they allow you to have only spiders or
have spiders and tall mobs mixed

76
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
have spiders and tall mobs mixed
 

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
have spiders and tall mobs mixed
together I think some have even made it

78
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,610
together I think some have even made it
 

79
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,760
together I think some have even made it
so they can have only tall mobs so you

80
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,770
so they can have only tall mobs so you
 

81
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,280
so they can have only tall mobs so you
have like three options there

82
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,290
have like three options there
 

83
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,170
have like three options there
and they're cool and everything but I

84
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,180
and they're cool and everything but I
 

85
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,990
and they're cool and everything but I
really just want a spider only system

86
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,000
really just want a spider only system
 

87
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,750
really just want a spider only system
because we're gonna have to spawning

88
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
because we're gonna have to spawning
 

89
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
because we're gonna have to spawning
systems we're gonna have one dedicated

90
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,370
systems we're gonna have one dedicated
 

91
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,270
systems we're gonna have one dedicated
for the spiders only and we're gonna

92
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
for the spiders only and we're gonna
 

93
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,250
for the spiders only and we're gonna
design it specifically for them and

94
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,260
design it specifically for them and
 

95
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,399
design it specifically for them and
their unique shape and climbing ability

96
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:40,409
their unique shape and climbing ability
 

97
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,430
their unique shape and climbing ability
and all that annoying stuff about them

98
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,440
and all that annoying stuff about them
 

99
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,309
and all that annoying stuff about them
to make it work efficiently and then

100
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
to make it work efficiently and then
 

101
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,569
to make it work efficiently and then
we're gonna have a second spawning

102
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:47,579
we're gonna have a second spawning
 

103
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,280
we're gonna have a second spawning
system for the tall mobs

104
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,290
system for the tall mobs
 

105
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,860
system for the tall mobs
only so we're gonna keep them separate

106
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:51,870
only so we're gonna keep them separate
 

107
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,500
only so we're gonna keep them separate
and design each one specifically for the

108
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,510
and design each one specifically for the
 

109
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,080
and design each one specifically for the
shape and that of the mob because that's

110
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,090
shape and that of the mob because that's
 

111
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,449
shape and that of the mob because that's
to me that's a real benefit of being

112
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:02,459
to me that's a real benefit of being
 

113
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,240
to me that's a real benefit of being
able to make a spider only system or to

114
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,250
able to make a spider only system or to
 

115
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,300
able to make a spider only system or to
make you know that whole trick with a

116
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,310
make you know that whole trick with a
 

117
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,210
make you know that whole trick with a
glass block and that is so that you can

118
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,220
glass block and that is so that you can
 

119
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,430
glass block and that is so that you can
make specific spawning systems for that

120
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
make specific spawning systems for that
 

121
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,399
make specific spawning systems for that
mom now what was I gonna say I lost my

122
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:19,409
mom now what was I gonna say I lost my
 

123
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:31,479
mom now what was I gonna say I lost my
thought now we're all my cows and sheep

124
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:31,489

 

125
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,040

there's nothing spawning what's going on

126
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,050
there's nothing spawning what's going on
 

127
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,080
there's nothing spawning what's going on
oh man I'm worried about this never

128
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,090
oh man I'm worried about this never
 

129
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,850
oh man I'm worried about this never
happened before and me have messed

130
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:44,860
happened before and me have messed
 

131
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,660
happened before and me have messed
something up the chickens stuck there

132
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:51,670
something up the chickens stuck there
 

133
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,450
something up the chickens stuck there
that's from before I know still waiting

134
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:54,460
that's from before I know still waiting
 

135
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,590
that's from before I know still waiting
for him to be spawned dead no they're

136
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:01,600
for him to be spawned dead no they're
 

137
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,640
for him to be spawned dead no they're
not on

138
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:06,650

 

139
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:14,839

no I think I'm being affected by the

140
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:14,849
no I think I'm being affected by the
 

141
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,610
no I think I'm being affected by the
mobs not spawning glitch for the first

142
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:19,620
mobs not spawning glitch for the first
 

143
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:41,770
mobs not spawning glitch for the first
time for some reason that was unexpected

144
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,780

 

145
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,810

yeah I don't know I was weird but

146
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,820
yeah I don't know I was weird but
 

147
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,730
yeah I don't know I was weird but
they're they're back to normal now I

148
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:46,740
they're they're back to normal now I
 

149
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,000
they're they're back to normal now I
just walked towards that Island that

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,010
just walked towards that Island that
 

151
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,300
just walked towards that Island that
blew up or that piece of land I blew up

152
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,310
blew up or that piece of land I blew up
 

153
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,379
blew up or that piece of land I blew up
and came back and is working again so

154
00:04:59,379 --> 00:04:59,389

 

155
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,680

don't know anyway back to work here so

156
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,690
don't know anyway back to work here so
 

157
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,650
don't know anyway back to work here so
originally I think you're making a giant

158
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:08,660
originally I think you're making a giant
 

159
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,330
originally I think you're making a giant
spawning pad for the spiders like just

160
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:11,340
spawning pad for the spiders like just
 

161
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,710
spawning pad for the spiders like just
one huge pad with water canals in it to

162
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,720
one huge pad with water canals in it to
 

163
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,279
one huge pad with water canals in it to
push them the direction the general

164
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,289
push them the direction the general
 

165
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,540
push them the direction the general
direction I want them to go as even

166
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,550
direction I want them to go as even
 

167
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,450
direction I want them to go as even
experimenting with the lighting for the

168
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:26,460
experimenting with the lighting for the
 

169
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,860
experimenting with the lighting for the
floor that I could use and I've actually

170
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:30,870
floor that I could use and I've actually
 

171
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,690
floor that I could use and I've actually
recorded an episode of me building the

172
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:32,700
recorded an episode of me building the
 

173
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,090
recorded an episode of me building the
spawning pad that I have now deleted

174
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,100

 

175
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:44,900

because I changed my life yeah so I came

176
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:44,910
because I changed my life yeah so I came
 

177
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,760
because I changed my life yeah so I came
up with a pretty good idea that we're

178
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,770
up with a pretty good idea that we're
 

179
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,790
up with a pretty good idea that we're
gonna do instead so I loaded my back up

180
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:49,800
gonna do instead so I loaded my back up
 

181
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,120
gonna do instead so I loaded my back up
and we're redoing everything here

182
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,130
and we're redoing everything here
 

183
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,710
and we're redoing everything here
although it looks like I'm starting

184
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
although it looks like I'm starting
 

185
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,930
although it looks like I'm starting
fresh and in the episode I deleted I

186
00:05:59,930 --> 00:05:59,940
fresh and in the episode I deleted I
 

187
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,510
fresh and in the episode I deleted I
decided I was gonna build with smooth

188
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
decided I was gonna build with smooth
 

189
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,890
decided I was gonna build with smooth
stone mostly the pad because one thing I

190
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:06,900
stone mostly the pad because one thing I
 

191
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,570
stone mostly the pad because one thing I
don't have enough sandstone to do it's

192
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,580
don't have enough sandstone to do it's
 

193
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,240
don't have enough sandstone to do it's
another thing

194
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,250
another thing
 

195
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,279
another thing
cobblestone would be the easiest but I

196
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,289
cobblestone would be the easiest but I
 

197
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,080
cobblestone would be the easiest but I
don't really like how it looks

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,090
don't really like how it looks
 

199
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,340
don't really like how it looks
and also I don't want to use dirt so

200
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,350
and also I don't want to use dirt so
 

201
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,330
and also I don't want to use dirt so
smooth stone I have an abundant source

202
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:26,340
smooth stone I have an abundant source
 

203
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,909
smooth stone I have an abundant source
of it as long as I have enough fuel to

204
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
of it as long as I have enough fuel to
 

205
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,500
of it as long as I have enough fuel to
to smelt it and it looks pretty good too

206
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,510
to smelt it and it looks pretty good too
 

207
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,510
to smelt it and it looks pretty good too
this is gonna actually gonna be the

208
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
this is gonna actually gonna be the
 

209
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,640
this is gonna actually gonna be the
first thing I've ever really built with

210
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:37,650
first thing I've ever really built with
 

211
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,780
first thing I've ever really built with
smooth stone which it's kind of hard to

212
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:41,790
smooth stone which it's kind of hard to
 

213
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,860
smooth stone which it's kind of hard to
leave because I've been playing this

214
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:42,870
leave because I've been playing this
 

215
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,600
leave because I've been playing this
game how long I always use cobblestone

216
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,610
game how long I always use cobblestone
 

217
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,770
game how long I always use cobblestone
instead just because it's easier but

218
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:48,780
instead just because it's easier but
 

219
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,719
instead just because it's easier but
we're gonna use some with stone and we

220
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:50,729
we're gonna use some with stone and we
 

221
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,180
we're gonna use some with stone and we
are going to go up there and get started

222
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,190
are going to go up there and get started
 

223
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,490
are going to go up there and get started
so the main problem I'm having here is

224
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
so the main problem I'm having here is
 

225
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,530
so the main problem I'm having here is
the passive mob farm is in the way like

226
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,540
the passive mob farm is in the way like
 

227
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,159
the passive mob farm is in the way like
really in the way with this new idea I

228
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,169
really in the way with this new idea I
 

229
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:13,250
really in the way with this new idea I
have we may end up half having to cut

230
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,260
have we may end up half having to cut
 

231
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,070
have we may end up half having to cut
off this wing here from the passive mob

232
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
off this wing here from the passive mob
 

233
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,090
off this wing here from the passive mob
farm and maybe adjusting things to it

234
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,100
farm and maybe adjusting things to it
 

235
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,700
farm and maybe adjusting things to it
later but for right now what we're gonna

236
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
later but for right now what we're gonna
 

237
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,250
later but for right now what we're gonna
do we're just gonna cut a hole through

238
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,260
do we're just gonna cut a hole through
 

239
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:35,850
do we're just gonna cut a hole through
it from this tube and I'm gonna mark

240
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:35,860

 

241
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,690

mark clear this whole belongs

242
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:42,700

 

243
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,220

I have to be quick otherwise the water

244
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,230
I have to be quick otherwise the water
 

245
00:07:47,230 --> 00:08:00,140
I have to be quick otherwise the water
will spill out ah

246
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,150

 

247
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:12,870

there you'll see

248
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:12,880

 

249
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,710

um yeah let's go up there find that spot

250
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:19,720
um yeah let's go up there find that spot
 

251
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,490
um yeah let's go up there find that spot
the spider spawning system I'm making

252
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:24,500
the spider spawning system I'm making
 

253
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,980
the spider spawning system I'm making
now instead being one large pad it's

254
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:26,990
now instead being one large pad it's
 

255
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,110
now instead being one large pad it's
gonna be mostly vertical and several

256
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
gonna be mostly vertical and several
 

257
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,860
gonna be mostly vertical and several
layers as many layers as we can get with

258
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:35,870
layers as many layers as we can get with
 

259
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,300
layers as many layers as we can get with
all this stuff in the way I figured out

260
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,310
all this stuff in the way I figured out
 

261
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,550
all this stuff in the way I figured out
I can only get six layers unfortunately

262
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:41,560
I can only get six layers unfortunately
 

263
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,670
I can only get six layers unfortunately
for a total of fleming calculate here

264
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
for a total of fleming calculate here
 

265
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,420
for a total of fleming calculate here
about 800 now it'd be less it's maybe

266
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,430
about 800 now it'd be less it's maybe
 

267
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,910
about 800 now it'd be less it's maybe
about 700 spawning spaces for spiders

268
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:54,920
about 700 spawning spaces for spiders
 

269
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:04,050
about 700 spawning spaces for spiders
with six layers kind of small

270
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,060

 

271
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,970

so yeah hours gonna cut a hole through

272
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:05,980
so yeah hours gonna cut a hole through
 

273
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:15,060
so yeah hours gonna cut a hole through
here right now probably leave this one

274
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,070
here right now probably leave this one
 

275
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:23,780
here right now probably leave this one
here run our two braids through the

276
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:23,790
here run our two braids through the
 

277
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:31,310
here run our two braids through the
passive spawning system I will need to

278
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,320
passive spawning system I will need to
 

279
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,010
passive spawning system I will need to
adjust this a little bit because the

280
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,020
adjust this a little bit because the
 

281
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,270
adjust this a little bit because the
water currents are really messed up

282
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,280
water currents are really messed up
 

283
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,000
water currents are really messed up
right now but I'll do that in a little

284
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,010
right now but I'll do that in a little
 

285
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,500
right now but I'll do that in a little
bit later

286
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,510
bit later
 

287
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,640
bit later
it may be off-camera then we need to go

288
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:44,650
it may be off-camera then we need to go
 

289
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,580
it may be off-camera then we need to go
through here oh yeah we have that

290
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:50,590
through here oh yeah we have that
 

291
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:57,900
through here oh yeah we have that
stinking piston switch above us - all

292
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:57,910
stinking piston switch above us - all
 

293
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,730
stinking piston switch above us - all
right I'll deal with that and then I

294
00:09:59,730 --> 00:09:59,740
right I'll deal with that and then I
 

295
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,840
right I'll deal with that and then I
will be back all right so that's done

296
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:03,850
will be back all right so that's done
 

297
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,820
will be back all right so that's done
I hate crippling the passive mob

298
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:05,830
I hate crippling the passive mob
 

299
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,870
I hate crippling the passive mob
spawning system but I think you man it's

300
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:09,880
spawning system but I think you man it's
 

301
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,690
spawning system but I think you man it's
gonna work out better this way and it

302
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:12,700
gonna work out better this way and it
 

303
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,390
gonna work out better this way and it
shouldn't affect it too much so our next

304
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,400
shouldn't affect it too much so our next
 

305
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,800
shouldn't affect it too much so our next
step here is to start building and I

306
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:18,810
step here is to start building and I
 

307
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,440
step here is to start building and I
think I'm gonna try do one of those

308
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,450
think I'm gonna try do one of those
 

309
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,940
think I'm gonna try do one of those
super speed things with voiceover

310
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:23,950
super speed things with voiceover
 

311
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,500
super speed things with voiceover
commentary so you can watch them deal

312
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,510
commentary so you can watch them deal
 

313
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,950
commentary so you can watch them deal
the whole thing and hopefully I don't

314
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:28,960
the whole thing and hopefully I don't
 

315
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,160
the whole thing and hopefully I don't
mess up in editing and it actually turns

316
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,170
mess up in editing and it actually turns
 

317
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,540
mess up in editing and it actually turns
out so here we go here we go

318
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,550
out so here we go here we go
 

319
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,770
out so here we go here we go
so the first thing I'm doing here is I'm

320
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:40,780
so the first thing I'm doing here is I'm
 

321
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,900
so the first thing I'm doing here is I'm
counting out ten blocks on each of the

322
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:42,910
counting out ten blocks on each of the
 

323
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,760
counting out ten blocks on each of the
sides I got to make a giant square here

324
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:46,770
sides I got to make a giant square here
 

325
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,670
sides I got to make a giant square here
it's gonna be a 20 by 20 square to start

326
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:50,680
it's gonna be a 20 by 20 square to start
 

327
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,700
it's gonna be a 20 by 20 square to start
out with and I'm just outlining the

328
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:52,710
out with and I'm just outlining the
 

329
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,200
out with and I'm just outlining the
borders of it now holding shifts so I

330
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,210
borders of it now holding shifts so I
 

331
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:06,239
borders of it now holding shifts so I
don't fall off

332
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,249

 

333
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,460

yeah this is this layer here is 20 by 20

334
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,470
yeah this is this layer here is 20 by 20
 

335
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,619
yeah this is this layer here is 20 by 20
but this is not where the spiders are

336
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:11,629
but this is not where the spiders are
 

337
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,600
but this is not where the spiders are
actually I'm spawning on we gotta go up

338
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:13,610
actually I'm spawning on we gotta go up
 

339
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,689
actually I'm spawning on we gotta go up
one more layer yet which the next layer

340
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:16,699
one more layer yet which the next layer
 

341
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:22,859
one more layer yet which the next layer
will be 22 by 22 so keep that in mind

342
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:22,869
will be 22 by 22 so keep that in mind
 

343
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,540
will be 22 by 22 so keep that in mind
yeah this is this is how I like to fill

344
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,550
yeah this is this is how I like to fill
 

345
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,069
yeah this is this is how I like to fill
things in I'll put down these cross

346
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:27,079
things in I'll put down these cross
 

347
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,949
things in I'll put down these cross
sections with the two or three wide

348
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:29,959
sections with the two or three wide
 

349
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:47,859
sections with the two or three wide
airspace between and then it's really

350
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:47,869
airspace between and then it's really
 

351
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:51,160
airspace between and then it's really
easy to fill in the square hole down

352
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,170
easy to fill in the square hole down
 

353
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:58,210
easy to fill in the square hole down
right right click sounds really cool in

354
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,220
right right click sounds really cool in
 

355
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:06,009
right right click sounds really cool in
3 times speed I love that noise and of

356
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:06,019
3 times speed I love that noise and of
 

357
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,600
3 times speed I love that noise and of
course I fell down there I was trying

358
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,610
course I fell down there I was trying
 

359
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,419
course I fell down there I was trying
very careful not to do that and I still

360
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:10,429
very careful not to do that and I still
 

361
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:25,539
very careful not to do that and I still
did it anyway done here yeah so that's

362
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:25,549
did it anyway done here yeah so that's
 

363
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:29,650
did it anyway done here yeah so that's
that's 20 by 20 I'm just counting here

364
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,660
that's 20 by 20 I'm just counting here
 

365
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,889
that's 20 by 20 I'm just counting here
to make sure I I measured right because

366
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:31,899
to make sure I I measured right because
 

367
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,799
to make sure I I measured right because
this is the base measurement for my

368
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:35,809
this is the base measurement for my
 

369
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,329
this is the base measurement for my
whole thing here it would suck if I got

370
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:37,339
whole thing here it would suck if I got
 

371
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,160
whole thing here it would suck if I got
this wrong and now I'm just adding

372
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,170
this wrong and now I'm just adding
 

373
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,259
this wrong and now I'm just adding
outside border for the second layer so

374
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:44,269
outside border for the second layer so
 

375
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,970
outside border for the second layer so
it's gonna be 22 by 22 the layer below

376
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:48,980
it's gonna be 22 by 22 the layer below
 

377
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,939
it's gonna be 22 by 22 the layer below
is just the bold water in place

378
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:51,949
is just the bold water in place
 

379
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,039
is just the bold water in place
basically because I'll be drilling some

380
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,049
basically because I'll be drilling some
 

381
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:57,280
basically because I'll be drilling some
holes in the second layer and the first

382
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,290
holes in the second layer and the first
 

383
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,109
holes in the second layer and the first
layer I put down is to catch the water

384
00:12:59,109 --> 00:12:59,119
layer I put down is to catch the water
 

385
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:03,269
layer I put down is to catch the water
from spilling everywhere

386
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279

 

387
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,189

alright get the borders done I want to

388
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:06,199
alright get the borders done I want to
 

389
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,669
alright get the borders done I want to
make sure I don't fall down again fill

390
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:09,679
make sure I don't fall down again fill
 

391
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:20,210
make sure I don't fall down again fill
it in

392
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,220

 

393
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,920

it's been a long time since I've done

394
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:22,930
it's been a long time since I've done
 

395
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,869
it's been a long time since I've done
anything fancy with editing so I thought

396
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:24,879
anything fancy with editing so I thought
 

397
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,759
anything fancy with editing so I thought
I'd give it a shot this this time last

398
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:29,769
I'd give it a shot this this time last
 

399
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,860
I'd give it a shot this this time last
time I tried to do the three time speed

400
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:31,870
time I tried to do the three time speed
 

401
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,340
time I tried to do the three time speed
thing was I think for that nether trip

402
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,350
thing was I think for that nether trip
 

403
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,790
thing was I think for that nether trip
disaster and I ended up recording the

404
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
disaster and I ended up recording the
 

405
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,429
disaster and I ended up recording the
whole thing with voice over commentary

406
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:41,439
whole thing with voice over commentary
 

407
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,410
whole thing with voice over commentary
and after about 30 minutes I realized

408
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:43,420
and after about 30 minutes I realized
 

409
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,249
and after about 30 minutes I realized
that my mic plugged in yeah I got pretty

410
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:47,259
that my mic plugged in yeah I got pretty
 

411
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,499
that my mic plugged in yeah I got pretty
upset with that and I just ended up

412
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:49,509
upset with that and I just ended up
 

413
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,009
upset with that and I just ended up
releasing the episode sense and they're

414
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:53,019
releasing the episode sense and they're
 

415
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,619
releasing the episode sense and they're
pretty crummy episodes so I haven't been

416
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:55,629
pretty crummy episodes so I haven't been
 

417
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,170
pretty crummy episodes so I haven't been
too excited to try anything fancy in a

418
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,180
too excited to try anything fancy in a
 

419
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:08,790
too excited to try anything fancy in a
long time and now I'm just adding

420
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
long time and now I'm just adding
 

421
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,030
long time and now I'm just adding
another outside wall this will be to

422
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
another outside wall this will be to
 

423
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,030
another outside wall this will be to
hold the water and stuff in place all

424
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
hold the water and stuff in place all
 

425
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,079
hold the water and stuff in place all
right to work in the clouds though

426
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,089
right to work in the clouds though
 

427
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:30,170
right to work in the clouds though
they're pretty annoying

428
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,180

 

429
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,060

so I thought for this part of the

430
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,070
so I thought for this part of the
 

431
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,520
so I thought for this part of the
building we do it at regular speed cuz

432
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:34,530
building we do it at regular speed cuz
 

433
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,840
building we do it at regular speed cuz
it's gonna get a little bit more

434
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:35,850
it's gonna get a little bit more
 

435
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,930
it's gonna get a little bit more
difficult here and I have my graphic set

436
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:38,940
difficult here and I have my graphic set
 

437
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,570
difficult here and I have my graphic set
to fast now just so the clouds will be

438
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:41,580
to fast now just so the clouds will be
 

439
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,620
to fast now just so the clouds will be
less irritating we're gonna be doing the

440
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:45,630
less irritating we're gonna be doing the
 

441
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:52,040
less irritating we're gonna be doing the
water canals now I know it looks like

442
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,050
water canals now I know it looks like
 

443
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,200
water canals now I know it looks like
I've built this before but I haven't I'm

444
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,210
I've built this before but I haven't I'm
 

445
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,580
I've built this before but I haven't I'm
just going off of something night

446
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:55,590
just going off of something night
 

447
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,140
just going off of something night
doodled on paper this whole design so

448
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,150
doodled on paper this whole design so
 

449
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,000
doodled on paper this whole design so
it's a little bit challenging for me

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,010
it's a little bit challenging for me
 

451
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,390
it's a little bit challenging for me
it's still too but for the center's

452
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,400
it's still too but for the center's
 

453
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,170
it's still too but for the center's
we're gonna have I do need an infinite

454
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,180
we're gonna have I do need an infinite
 

455
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:18,590
we're gonna have I do need an infinite
pool somewhere for the Centers we'll

456
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,600
pool somewhere for the Centers we'll
 

457
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,870
pool somewhere for the Centers we'll
have the water like this I think this

458
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
have the water like this I think this
 

459
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,610
have the water like this I think this
will work good because it'll kind of

460
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:25,620
will work good because it'll kind of
 

461
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,500
will work good because it'll kind of
suck the spiders into the center and

462
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,510
suck the spiders into the center and
 

463
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,320
suck the spiders into the center and
they won't be able to go out of this

464
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,330
they won't be able to go out of this
 

465
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,300
they won't be able to go out of this
stream by going left or right I hope

466
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,310

 

467
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,550

that ends up short how did I figure this

468
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:37,560
that ends up short how did I figure this
 

469
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:47,180
that ends up short how did I figure this
I think I have to afford two blocks

470
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,190

 

471
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:55,460

that tells me I made this too big I

472
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,470
that tells me I made this too big I
 

473
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,750
that tells me I made this too big I
think I'm going to afford one more block

474
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:57,760
think I'm going to afford one more block
 

475
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:19,070
think I'm going to afford one more block
yet right make some pressure plates oh

476
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,080

 

477
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,060

wait how did I do that I was gonna have

478
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,070
wait how did I do that I was gonna have
 

479
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,380
wait how did I do that I was gonna have
two blocks behind there and then a

480
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,390
two blocks behind there and then a
 

481
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,840
two blocks behind there and then a
pressure plate don't understand why I

482
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:30,850
pressure plate don't understand why I
 

483
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,760
pressure plate don't understand why I
have all this space I'm sure I built

484
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:32,770
have all this space I'm sure I built
 

485
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:42,180
have all this space I'm sure I built
this too big anyway so the trick here is

486
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,190
this too big anyway so the trick here is
 

487
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,850
this too big anyway so the trick here is
going to be deep down going to be too

488
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:44,860
going to be deep down going to be too
 

489
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,270
going to be deep down going to be too
big down two blocks here this is why we

490
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,280
big down two blocks here this is why we
 

491
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,370
big down two blocks here this is why we
have that layer below and then date down

492
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:53,380
have that layer below and then date down
 

493
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:01,920
have that layer below and then date down
I think around here just work okay don't

494
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:01,930
I think around here just work okay don't
 

495
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,810
I think around here just work okay don't
work we got this issue we should place

496
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:06,820
work we got this issue we should place
 

497
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,680
work we got this issue we should place
box over top actually just so that our

498
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:10,690
box over top actually just so that our
 

499
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:23,329
box over top actually just so that our
water doesn't freeze while we're working

500
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:23,339

 

501
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:40,770

all right speaking ice there we go look

502
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:40,780
all right speaking ice there we go look
 

503
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,100
all right speaking ice there we go look
went through another diamond pick all

504
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,110
went through another diamond pick all
 

505
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,960
went through another diamond pick all
right so now it should be safe or

506
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:48,970
right so now it should be safe or
 

507
00:17:48,970 --> 00:18:01,790
right so now it should be safe or
Newsies just like magic

508
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:01,800

 

509
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:10,760

water stays where we want it to and now

510
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:10,770

 

511
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,460

definitely messed up somewhere here yeah

512
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,470
definitely messed up somewhere here yeah
 

513
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,260
definitely messed up somewhere here yeah
well we'll try building another one on

514
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,270
well we'll try building another one on
 

515
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:29,250
well we'll try building another one on
this side how did we do this and then

516
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:29,260
this side how did we do this and then
 

517
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:36,000
this side how did we do this and then
next one here and we had the pressure

518
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,010
next one here and we had the pressure
 

519
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:42,299
next one here and we had the pressure
plates three from the wall there I'm not

520
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:42,309
plates three from the wall there I'm not
 

521
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,860
plates three from the wall there I'm not
sure why it's so big don't know why I

522
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:46,870
sure why it's so big don't know why I
 

523
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,669
sure why it's so big don't know why I
put those there

524
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
put those there
 

525
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:57,140
put those there
okay put those there and then two behind

526
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,150
okay put those there and then two behind
 

527
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:11,330
okay put those there and then two behind
gets more water

528
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,340

 

529
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:28,640

place it torch that cover them again

530
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:28,650
place it torch that cover them again
 

531
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:39,900
place it torch that cover them again
look how fast that froze okay and then

532
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:39,910
look how fast that froze okay and then
 

533
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:46,080
look how fast that froze okay and then
we'll punch hurt our holes there and add

534
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,090
we'll punch hurt our holes there and add
 

535
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:54,870
we'll punch hurt our holes there and add
this one to away from the end trying to

536
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
this one to away from the end trying to
 

537
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,800
this one to away from the end trying to
do this without using signs just because

538
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:58,810
do this without using signs just because
 

539
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,700
do this without using signs just because
I think it's a lot better if you can

540
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:02,710
I think it's a lot better if you can
 

541
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,060
I think it's a lot better if you can
make something without signs so it ends

542
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,070
make something without signs so it ends
 

543
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,420
make something without signs so it ends
right at the hole that's perfect but I

544
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,430
right at the hole that's perfect but I
 

545
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,340
right at the hole that's perfect but I
figured something out wrong here I'm

546
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,350
figured something out wrong here I'm
 

547
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,850
figured something out wrong here I'm
sure

548
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:16,860

 

549
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,890

let me count this one two three four one

550
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:22,900
let me count this one two three four one
 

551
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:33,420
let me count this one two three four one
two three four yep definitely counted

552
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,430
two three four yep definitely counted
 

553
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,480
two three four yep definitely counted
wrong

554
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,490

 

555
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,420

so I gotta move these walls in one it

556
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,430
so I gotta move these walls in one it
 

557
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:48,040
so I gotta move these walls in one it
seems and then I will be back that's

558
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,050
seems and then I will be back that's
 

559
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,130
seems and then I will be back that's
done now it's gonna affect my plans a

560
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,140
done now it's gonna affect my plans a
 

561
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,670
done now it's gonna affect my plans a
little bit though the way I figured this

562
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:53,680
little bit though the way I figured this
 

563
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,990
little bit though the way I figured this
because the next thing we're gonna do

564
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
because the next thing we're gonna do
 

565
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,490
because the next thing we're gonna do
here is the outside stream this is the

566
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:00,500
here is the outside stream this is the
 

567
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,100
here is the outside stream this is the
main stream actually I should mention

568
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,110
main stream actually I should mention
 

569
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,440
main stream actually I should mention
this is what's going to get our spiders

570
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,450
this is what's going to get our spiders
 

571
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,020
this is what's going to get our spiders
down the hole but I also want to put a

572
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,030
down the hole but I also want to put a
 

573
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,770
down the hole but I also want to put a
stream over here that'll push them that

574
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:11,780
stream over here that'll push them that
 

575
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,020
stream over here that'll push them that
way and that way if they come to this

576
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,030
way and that way if they come to this
 

577
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,270
way and that way if they come to this
outside wall just so that they'll get

578
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,280
outside wall just so that they'll get
 

579
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,690
outside wall just so that they'll get
closer to the center here and hopefully

580
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:19,700
closer to the center here and hopefully
 

581
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,900
closer to the center here and hopefully
get down faster and if I was to place

582
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:25,910
get down faster and if I was to place
 

583
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,430
get down faster and if I was to place
water here it would just spill out

584
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
water here it would just spill out
 

585
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,570
water here it would just spill out
everywhere so we can't do that we need

586
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:31,580
everywhere so we can't do that we need
 

587
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,650
everywhere so we can't do that we need
to do something fancy they're gonna put

588
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:35,660
to do something fancy they're gonna put
 

589
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:46,480
to do something fancy they're gonna put
a barrier here for it like that now and

590
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,490
a barrier here for it like that now and
 

591
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:54,420
a barrier here for it like that now and
replace it and we will put stone above

592
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,430

 

593
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,810

now it does that but again if we remove

594
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:58,820
now it does that but again if we remove
 

595
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,320
now it does that but again if we remove
this it'll just come out so we're gonna

596
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,330
this it'll just come out so we're gonna
 

597
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:08,320
this it'll just come out so we're gonna
dig down all the way here again that's

598
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,330
dig down all the way here again that's
 

599
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:14,980
dig down all the way here again that's
why we have that layer below like that

600
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:14,990
why we have that layer below like that
 

601
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,220
why we have that layer below like that
and now it's safe to remove our soil

602
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,230
and now it's safe to remove our soil
 

603
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:28,150
and now it's safe to remove our soil
barrier

604
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,160

 

605
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,160

and so what that leaves us with is this

606
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,170
and so what that leaves us with is this
 

607
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,100
and so what that leaves us with is this
seven by seven pad here this is what the

608
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,110
seven by seven pad here this is what the
 

609
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,070
seven by seven pad here this is what the
spiders are in spawn on but the way I

610
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
spiders are in spawn on but the way I
 

611
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,300
spiders are in spawn on but the way I
had this figure of four is this water

612
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,310
had this figure of four is this water
 

613
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,260
had this figure of four is this water
stream was like over here so the spider

614
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,270
stream was like over here so the spider
 

615
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,870
stream was like over here so the spider
would get forced into a center stream

616
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
would get forced into a center stream
 

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,290
would get forced into a center stream
now it's this pointing at nothing

618
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:53,300
now it's this pointing at nothing
 

619
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:02,420
now it's this pointing at nothing
unfortunately so if you try to deal with

620
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,430
unfortunately so if you try to deal with
 

621
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:13,430
unfortunately so if you try to deal with
that actually what I'll do using stone

622
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
that actually what I'll do using stone
 

623
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,690
that actually what I'll do using stone
pressure plates now maybe I'll extend

624
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,700
pressure plates now maybe I'll extend
 

625
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:26,210
pressure plates now maybe I'll extend
this and put a water here that'll force

626
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,220
this and put a water here that'll force
 

627
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,490
this and put a water here that'll force
the spider into this stream that way if

628
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,500
the spider into this stream that way if
 

629
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,950
the spider into this stream that way if
he decides he wants to go to this

630
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
he decides he wants to go to this
 

631
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,080
he decides he wants to go to this
outside wall instead of going to the

632
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,090
outside wall instead of going to the
 

633
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,300
outside wall instead of going to the
center here like we want them to yeah

634
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,310
center here like we want them to yeah
 

635
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,960
center here like we want them to yeah
okay and then in the center here we're

636
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:44,970
okay and then in the center here we're
 

637
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,470
okay and then in the center here we're
gonna drill a hole

638
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:49,480

 

639
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,960

and I'm gonna copy this pattern and I

640
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:51,970
and I'm gonna copy this pattern and I
 

641
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,220
and I'm gonna copy this pattern and I
will be back there it is that's the

642
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,230
will be back there it is that's the
 

643
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,759
will be back there it is that's the
floorplan so each of these pads is seven

644
00:23:59,759 --> 00:23:59,769
floorplan so each of these pads is seven
 

645
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:03,720
floorplan so each of these pads is seven
by seven but unfortunately because

646
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,730
by seven but unfortunately because
 

647
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,799
by seven but unfortunately because
spiders are so fat you don't get the

648
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:07,809
spiders are so fat you don't get the
 

649
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,769
spiders are so fat you don't get the
full seven by seven here to zip them if

650
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:10,779
full seven by seven here to zip them if
 

651
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,100
full seven by seven here to zip them if
they were to try to spawn say here they

652
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,110
they were to try to spawn say here they
 

653
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,500
they were to try to spawn say here they
need that three by three air space

654
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,510
need that three by three air space
 

655
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,970
need that three by three air space
around them for this bonding to work and

656
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:19,980
around them for this bonding to work and
 

657
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,430
around them for this bonding to work and
if they try to spawn here guess what we

658
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
if they try to spawn here guess what we
 

659
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,019
if they try to spawn here guess what we
got water next to that block so it

660
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:25,029
got water next to that block so it
 

661
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:29,009
got water next to that block so it
doesn't count so we only count five by

662
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,019
doesn't count so we only count five by
 

663
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,169
doesn't count so we only count five by
five really even though it's a seven by

664
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:31,179
five really even though it's a seven by
 

665
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,450
five really even though it's a seven by
seven and we're missing a block in the

666
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:33,460
seven and we're missing a block in the
 

667
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,779
seven and we're missing a block in the
center so it's it's only 24 blocks of

668
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:36,789
center so it's it's only 24 blocks of
 

669
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,470
center so it's it's only 24 blocks of
spawning space each of these pads so 24

670
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
spawning space each of these pads so 24
 

671
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,200
spawning space each of these pads so 24
times four is 96 right so each layer I

672
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,210
times four is 96 right so each layer I
 

673
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,690
times four is 96 right so each layer I
build will be 96 spawning spaces for

674
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:48,700
build will be 96 spawning spaces for
 

675
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,649
build will be 96 spawning spaces for
spiders which isn't a whole lot but it

676
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:52,659
spiders which isn't a whole lot but it
 

677
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,470
spiders which isn't a whole lot but it
will be super effective efficient

678
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,480
will be super effective efficient
 

679
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,590
will be super effective efficient
whatever when it's all done here and I'm

680
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
whatever when it's all done here and I'm
 

681
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,940
whatever when it's all done here and I'm
gonna make six six layers like this so

682
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:05,950
gonna make six six layers like this so
 

683
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,159
gonna make six six layers like this so
directly above this one we're gonna have

684
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:08,169
directly above this one we're gonna have
 

685
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,820
directly above this one we're gonna have
another layer each layer takes up three

686
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,830
another layer each layer takes up three
 

687
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,000
another layer each layer takes up three
vertical spaces unfortunately we're

688
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,010
vertical spaces unfortunately we're
 

689
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,860
vertical spaces unfortunately we're
really close to the top of the map so I

690
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:16,870
really close to the top of the map so I
 

691
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,389
really close to the top of the map so I
can only go up another five layers so

692
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:21,399
can only go up another five layers so
 

693
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,139
can only go up another five layers so
yeah that's what I will do let's finish

694
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:25,149
yeah that's what I will do let's finish
 

695
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,129
yeah that's what I will do let's finish
this up though I realized I'm being

696
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:29,139
this up though I realized I'm being
 

697
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,019
this up though I realized I'm being
pretty silly with the smooth stone I'm

698
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:31,029
pretty silly with the smooth stone I'm
 

699
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,269
pretty silly with the smooth stone I'm
going to switch to using cobble because

700
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
going to switch to using cobble because
 

701
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,549
going to switch to using cobble because
once this is built there's no way of

702
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:35,559
once this is built there's no way of
 

703
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,340
once this is built there's no way of
actually even seen in here because it's

704
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,350
actually even seen in here because it's
 

705
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,259
actually even seen in here because it's
only gonna be one high for the spiders

706
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:40,269
only gonna be one high for the spiders
 

707
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,009
only gonna be one high for the spiders
so there's no way of entering here so

708
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:44,019
so there's no way of entering here so
 

709
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,139
so there's no way of entering here so
switching the cobble for the inside

710
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:46,149
switching the cobble for the inside
 

711
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,740
switching the cobble for the inside
stuff and I'll keep smooth stone on the

712
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,750
stuff and I'll keep smooth stone on the
 

713
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,779
stuff and I'll keep smooth stone on the
outside anything that you can see I

714
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:51,789
outside anything that you can see I
 

715
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:57,960
outside anything that you can see I
guess just to save all my coal which is

716
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:57,970
guess just to save all my coal which is
 

717
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,540
guess just to save all my coal which is
dwindling away

718
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,550

 

719
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:09,050

so fill all this in putting Kabul over

720
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,060
so fill all this in putting Kabul over
 

721
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:15,080
so fill all this in putting Kabul over
all the water stream sections just to

722
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,090
all the water stream sections just to
 

723
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:31,030
all the water stream sections just to
save on glass here

724
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,040

 

725
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,220

one really good advantage of though

726
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,230
one really good advantage of though
 

727
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,740
one really good advantage of though
making this only one high is spiders

728
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:35,750
making this only one high is spiders
 

729
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,260
making this only one high is spiders
can't really fight the water streams if

730
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,270
can't really fight the water streams if
 

731
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,500
can't really fight the water streams if
they only have a one high clearance

732
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,510
they only have a one high clearance
 

733
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,540
they only have a one high clearance
because they hit their head on that one

734
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,550
because they hit their head on that one
 

735
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:48,220
because they hit their head on that one
high clearance so that's the main reason

736
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,230
high clearance so that's the main reason
 

737
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,030
high clearance so that's the main reason
why I didn't want to use the standard

738
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,040
why I didn't want to use the standard
 

739
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,070
why I didn't want to use the standard
water canals for this because they jump

740
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
water canals for this because they jump
 

741
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,590
water canals for this because they jump
around in those and if you let them

742
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:56,600
around in those and if you let them
 

743
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,670
around in those and if you let them
climb they will climb so they won't be

744
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:00,680
climb they will climb so they won't be
 

745
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,320
climb they will climb so they won't be
able to climb it in here and then we

746
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,330
able to climb it in here and then we
 

747
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,210
able to climb it in here and then we
need to put glass over the areas where

748
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,220
need to put glass over the areas where
 

749
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,990
need to put glass over the areas where
they can spawn I just

750
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
they can spawn I just
 

751
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,430
they can spawn I just
technically you probably don't need on

752
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:12,440
technically you probably don't need on
 

753
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,730
technically you probably don't need on
these outside this outside 7x7 ring as I

754
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:18,740
these outside this outside 7x7 ring as I
 

755
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,920
these outside this outside 7x7 ring as I
covered already but I'm going to put it

756
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:20,930
covered already but I'm going to put it
 

757
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,950
covered already but I'm going to put it
just just in case it has any influence I

758
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:23,960
just just in case it has any influence I
 

759
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:34,240
just just in case it has any influence I
don't think it does it's like that and

760
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,250
don't think it does it's like that and
 

761
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,740
don't think it does it's like that and
then I'm gonna leave a hole in the

762
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,750
then I'm gonna leave a hole in the
 

763
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,510
then I'm gonna leave a hole in the
center here and then I would start the

764
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:40,520
center here and then I would start the
 

765
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,020
center here and then I would start the
next layer so I would put down another

766
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,030
next layer so I would put down another
 

767
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,250
next layer so I would put down another
layer of cobble over this I guess

768
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,260
layer of cobble over this I guess
 

769
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:53,170
layer of cobble over this I guess
that'll make it dark inside don't want

770
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,180
that'll make it dark inside don't want
 

771
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:02,440
that'll make it dark inside don't want
to cover up my whole though and I oh I

772
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,450
to cover up my whole though and I oh I
 

773
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:11,380
to cover up my whole though and I oh I
do that more fish this up I'm only gonna

774
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,390
do that more fish this up I'm only gonna
 

775
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,580
do that more fish this up I'm only gonna
show you one that I'm gonna do the rest

776
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:12,590
show you one that I'm gonna do the rest
 

777
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:19,980
show you one that I'm gonna do the rest
off camera okay

778
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:19,990

 

779
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,680

so then this would be the next pad for

780
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:23,690
so then this would be the next pad for
 

781
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,260
so then this would be the next pad for
the spiders to spawn on directly what

782
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,270
the spiders to spawn on directly what
 

783
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,760
the spiders to spawn on directly what
we're on here and we would have the

784
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:27,770
we're on here and we would have the
 

785
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,280
we're on here and we would have the
water around it and it would all go to

786
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,290
water around it and it would all go to
 

787
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,750
water around it and it would all go to
the center like this one below and we're

788
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:34,760
the center like this one below and we're
 

789
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,520
the center like this one below and we're
just making a tall vertical tower type

790
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:36,530
just making a tall vertical tower type
 

791
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,930
just making a tall vertical tower type
thing then the beauty of all this once

792
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:40,940
thing then the beauty of all this once
 

793
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,610
thing then the beauty of all this once
it's all done at the very top we'll have

794
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:42,620
it's all done at the very top we'll have
 

795
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,880
it's all done at the very top we'll have
Pistons controlling lava and the lava

796
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:45,890
Pistons controlling lava and the lava
 

797
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,760
Pistons controlling lava and the lava
will flow down a column down the center

798
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:48,770
will flow down a column down the center
 

799
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,320
will flow down a column down the center
here and it will light up every single

800
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,330
here and it will light up every single
 

801
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,510
here and it will light up every single
pad on its way down

802
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:52,520
pad on its way down
 

803
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,549
pad on its way down
because if there's lava right where the

804
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:57,559
because if there's lava right where the
 

805
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,760
because if there's lava right where the
soil block is it lights up

806
00:28:59,760 --> 00:28:59,770
soil block is it lights up
 

807
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,270
soil block is it lights up
lavel eight level 15 this would be 14 13

808
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,280
lavel eight level 15 this would be 14 13
 

809
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,560
lavel eight level 15 this would be 14 13
12 11 10 9 at the very corner here and

810
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:10,570
12 11 10 9 at the very corner here and
 

811
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,880
12 11 10 9 at the very corner here and
mobs can spawn at light level 7 or less

812
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:15,890
mobs can spawn at light level 7 or less
 

813
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,530
mobs can spawn at light level 7 or less
so if it's light level 9 they won't be

814
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:17,540
so if it's light level 9 they won't be
 

815
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,110
so if it's light level 9 they won't be
able to spawn so if we have lava flowing

816
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,120
able to spawn so if we have lava flowing
 

817
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,650
able to spawn so if we have lava flowing
down it should do the trick in light up

818
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:23,660
down it should do the trick in light up
 

819
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,680
down it should do the trick in light up
however many pads we want using only for

820
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,690
however many pads we want using only for
 

821
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,450
however many pads we want using only for
lava so that's cool however many stacks

822
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:31,460
lava so that's cool however many stacks
 

823
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,180
lava so that's cool however many stacks
of these pads whatever I don't know what

824
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,190
of these pads whatever I don't know what
 

825
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,190
of these pads whatever I don't know what
the call that's the plan it's gonna take

826
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
the call that's the plan it's gonna take
 

827
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,430
the call that's the plan it's gonna take
a lot of resources though because well

828
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,440
a lot of resources though because well
 

829
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,380
a lot of resources though because well
let me figure it out here I use 7 times

830
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,390
let me figure it out here I use 7 times
 

831
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:50,730
let me figure it out here I use 7 times
7 that's 49 200 times 6 only 1200 glass

832
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:50,740
7 that's 49 200 times 6 only 1200 glass
 

833
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,030
7 that's 49 200 times 6 only 1200 glass
just to do six stacks of these pads I

834
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,040
just to do six stacks of these pads I
 

835
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,720
just to do six stacks of these pads I
don't know where I'm going to get all

836
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:58,730
don't know where I'm going to get all
 

837
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:05,420
don't know where I'm going to get all
that glass that's a lot

838
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,430

 

839
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,640

good I switch to Kabul though because I

840
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:07,650
good I switch to Kabul though because I
 

841
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,080
good I switch to Kabul though because I
will have no problem getting that much

842
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,090
will have no problem getting that much
 

843
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,840
will have no problem getting that much
Kabul smooth stone on the other hand I

844
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:11,850
Kabul smooth stone on the other hand I
 

845
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,049
Kabul smooth stone on the other hand I
would have a problem with that because I

846
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:15,059
would have a problem with that because I
 

847
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,740
would have a problem with that because I
don't have that much coal but yeah

848
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:18,750
don't have that much coal but yeah
 

849
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,020
don't have that much coal but yeah
that's the plan I will continue this

850
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,030
that's the plan I will continue this
 

851
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,400
that's the plan I will continue this
more off-camera and hopefully sometime

852
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,410
more off-camera and hopefully sometime
 

853
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,480
more off-camera and hopefully sometime
soon we can see it actually work again

854
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,490
soon we can see it actually work again
 

855
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,460
soon we can see it actually work again
that's not much responding space only 24

856
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,470
that's not much responding space only 24
 

857
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:37,310
that's not much responding space only 24
blocks that's that's very little so yeah

858
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,320
blocks that's that's very little so yeah
 

859
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,560
blocks that's that's very little so yeah
I'll figure it out 24 times four times

860
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,570
I'll figure it out 24 times four times
 

861
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,210
I'll figure it out 24 times four times
six with six stacks we will have 576

862
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,220
six with six stacks we will have 576
 

863
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,600
six with six stacks we will have 576
blocks of Bonnie's base that's also very

864
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,610
blocks of Bonnie's base that's also very
 

865
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,750
blocks of Bonnie's base that's also very
little so I might have to move the

866
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:50,760
little so I might have to move the
 

867
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,040
little so I might have to move the
passive mob farm so I can put in a few

868
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,050
passive mob farm so I can put in a few
 

869
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,040
passive mob farm so I can put in a few
more stacks to get more space I don't

870
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,050
more stacks to get more space I don't
 

871
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,510
more stacks to get more space I don't
know we'll see but yeah I'm gonna end it

872
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:02,520
know we'll see but yeah I'm gonna end it
 

873
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,299
know we'll see but yeah I'm gonna end it
here thank you for watching and take

874
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:05,309
here thank you for watching and take
 

875
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:12,740
here thank you for watching and take
care as always bye bye um yeah so we got

876
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:12,750
care as always bye bye um yeah so we got
 

877
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,390
care as always bye bye um yeah so we got
some bad news guys it looks like I'm

878
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:14,400
some bad news guys it looks like I'm
 

879
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
some bad news guys it looks like I'm
gonna have to load my back up and

880
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,290
gonna have to load my back up and
 

881
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,450
gonna have to load my back up and
rethink all this because even though

882
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:20,460
rethink all this because even though
 

883
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,480
rethink all this because even though
that concept looked like it was good it

884
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,490
that concept looked like it was good it
 

885
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:30,200
that concept looked like it was good it
is not good so it's all closed off

886
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,210
is not good so it's all closed off
 

887
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,390
is not good so it's all closed off
inside there we got the 96 spawning

888
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:32,400
inside there we got the 96 spawning
 

889
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,160
inside there we got the 96 spawning
spaces in one layer and very few spiders

890
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,170
spaces in one layer and very few spiders
 

891
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,110
spaces in one layer and very few spiders
if any at all they're actually spawning

892
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
if any at all they're actually spawning
 

893
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,370
if any at all they're actually spawning
it compared to you know like the 20 or

894
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,380
it compared to you know like the 20 or
 

895
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,040
it compared to you know like the 20 or
so that are spawning on top if it was a

896
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,050
so that are spawning on top if it was a
 

897
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:52,070
so that are spawning on top if it was a
flat surface so I don't know if the

898
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
flat surface so I don't know if the
 

899
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
flat surface so I don't know if the
glass has something to do with that or

900
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,090
glass has something to do with that or
 

901
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:01,040
glass has something to do with that or
not but regardless my rates suck inside

902
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,050
not but regardless my rates suck inside
 

903
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,150
not but regardless my rates suck inside
there the other problem if a spider does

904
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,160
there the other problem if a spider does
 

905
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,669
there the other problem if a spider does
spawn in there he seems to not want to

906
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
spawn in there he seems to not want to
 

907
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,960
spawn in there he seems to not want to
go in the water streams so that didn't

908
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:11,970
go in the water streams so that didn't
 

909
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,780
go in the water streams so that didn't
work out too well they they just wander

910
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:14,790
work out too well they they just wander
 

911
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,460
work out too well they they just wander
around and they don't seem to go into

912
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:16,470
around and they don't seem to go into
 

913
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,950
around and they don't seem to go into
the water streams it's like they know

914
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
the water streams it's like they know
 

915
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:30,649
the water streams it's like they know
to avoid them so oh yeah
