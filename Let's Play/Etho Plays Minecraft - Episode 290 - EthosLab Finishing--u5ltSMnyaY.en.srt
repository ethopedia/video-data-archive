29
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,639

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,420
gonna make it so instead of having water
bottles in these chests and had like

58
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,430
bottles in these chests and had like
 

59
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,340
bottles in these chests and had like
having a nether wart at the start of

60
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,350
having a nether wart at the start of
 

61
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,780
having a nether wart at the start of
each of these brewing chains and then

62
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,790
each of these brewing chains and then
 

63
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,810
each of these brewing chains and then
going to sugar redstone or another word

64
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:47,820
going to sugar redstone or another word
 

65
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,139
going to sugar redstone or another word
spider eyes gunpowder all that we

66
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:51,149
spider eyes gunpowder all that we
 

67
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,850
spider eyes gunpowder all that we
skipped a step of adding the nether wart

68
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:52,860
skipped a step of adding the nether wart
 

69
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,679
skipped a step of adding the nether wart
and instead we start with awkward

70
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:54,689
and instead we start with awkward
 

71
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,200
and instead we start with awkward
potions here but then we got to

72
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,210
potions here but then we got to
 

73
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,959
potions here but then we got to
distribute those aquaporins we brew them

74
00:01:59,959 --> 00:01:59,969
distribute those aquaporins we brew them
 

75
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,459
distribute those aquaporins we brew them
over there and we got to send them to

76
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:01,469
over there and we got to send them to
 

77
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,420
over there and we got to send them to
all these starter chests so like here

78
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,430
all these starter chests so like here
 

79
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,270
all these starter chests so like here
let's chests here that one there that

80
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
let's chests here that one there that
 

81
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,949
let's chests here that one there that
one there there's eight to drop off

82
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
one there there's eight to drop off
 

83
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,410
one there there's eight to drop off
zones we have to send awkward potions to

84
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,420
zones we have to send awkward potions to
 

85
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,030
zones we have to send awkward potions to
so that's

86
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
so that's
 

87
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,380
so that's
that's what the episode was about we

88
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,390
that's what the episode was about we
 

89
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,380
that's what the episode was about we
were building a minecart system to to

90
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,390
were building a minecart system to to
 

91
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,240
were building a minecart system to to
move them around and I think I think the

92
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,250
move them around and I think I think the
 

93
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,300
move them around and I think I think the
lab is done now you just have to test it

94
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,310
lab is done now you just have to test it
 

95
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,610
lab is done now you just have to test it
out I haven't tested it to see if it

96
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
out I haven't tested it to see if it
 

97
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,000
out I haven't tested it to see if it
works but let's go check some things out

98
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,010
works but let's go check some things out
 

99
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,740
works but let's go check some things out
so kind of finished up this area bits

100
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:32,750
so kind of finished up this area bits
 

101
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,460
so kind of finished up this area bits
didn't really know what to do with this

102
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,470
didn't really know what to do with this
 

103
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,890
didn't really know what to do with this
wall we have all this wiring back there

104
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:36,900
wall we have all this wiring back there
 

105
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,420
wall we have all this wiring back there
so kind of have to be one thick and

106
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,430
so kind of have to be one thick and
 

107
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,240
so kind of have to be one thick and
that's about the best I could do it

108
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,250
that's about the best I could do it
 

109
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,619
that's about the best I could do it
adding depth to the wall here we got the

110
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:45,629
adding depth to the wall here we got the
 

111
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,210
adding depth to the wall here we got the
five brewing stands for brewing awkward

112
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220
five brewing stands for brewing awkward
 

113
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,259
five brewing stands for brewing awkward
potions and we have hoppers above here

114
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:51,269
potions and we have hoppers above here
 

115
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,539
potions and we have hoppers above here
that are supposed to distribute water

116
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:53,549
that are supposed to distribute water
 

117
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,940
that are supposed to distribute water
bottles so they run across these hoppers

118
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:55,950
bottles so they run across these hoppers
 

119
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,520
bottles so they run across these hoppers
at the second level and they get dropped

120
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,530
at the second level and they get dropped
 

121
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,750
at the second level and they get dropped
off into these and and the broom stands

122
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
off into these and and the broom stands
 

123
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,190
off into these and and the broom stands
can pick them up if we go up here this

124
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
can pick them up if we go up here this
 

125
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,180
can pick them up if we go up here this
is what I've added to fill the bottles

126
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,190
is what I've added to fill the bottles
 

127
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,430
is what I've added to fill the bottles
to make water bottles

128
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
to make water bottles
 

129
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,580
to make water bottles
you got a chest up here they're the

130
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:16,590
you got a chest up here they're the
 

131
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,050
you got a chest up here they're the
first ones we're doing by the way I

132
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,060
first ones we're doing by the way I
 

133
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,819
first ones we're doing by the way I
tried to do everything for the first

134
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:19,829
tried to do everything for the first
 

135
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,490
tried to do everything for the first
time on camera when I can this is

136
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
time on camera when I can this is
 

137
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,680
time on camera when I can this is
working so so these things to be falling

138
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:27,690
working so so these things to be falling
 

139
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,449
working so so these things to be falling
maybe I gotta stand a little more

140
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:29,459
maybe I gotta stand a little more
 

141
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,670
maybe I gotta stand a little more
centered yeah so the idea is we're gonna

142
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,680
centered yeah so the idea is we're gonna
 

143
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,460
centered yeah so the idea is we're gonna
have a huge huge buffer of water bottles

144
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,470
have a huge huge buffer of water bottles
 

145
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,439
have a huge huge buffer of water bottles
here and these filter down through a

146
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:39,449
here and these filter down through a
 

147
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:45,430
here and these filter down through a
bunch of hoppers to these chests and

148
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
bunch of hoppers to these chests and
 

149
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,960
bunch of hoppers to these chests and
these are gonna be a big buffer of water

150
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:47,970
these are gonna be a big buffer of water
 

151
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,500
these are gonna be a big buffer of water
bottles there's I think there's a double

152
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,510
bottles there's I think there's a double
 

153
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,309
bottles there's I think there's a double
chest there there there there there it's

154
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:55,319
chest there there there there there it's
 

155
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,710
chest there there there there there it's
over five double chests I think and then

156
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
over five double chests I think and then
 

157
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,149
over five double chests I think and then
we have all the hopper space to do so

158
00:03:59,149 --> 00:03:59,159
we have all the hopper space to do so
 

159
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,009
we have all the hopper space to do so
it's a lot of a lot of space for water

160
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,019
it's a lot of a lot of space for water
 

161
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,080
it's a lot of a lot of space for water

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,270
now they're good sweet all right that
 

323
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,090
now they're good sweet all right that
simplifies me a lot I was worried about

324
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,100
simplifies me a lot I was worried about
 

325
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,790
simplifies me a lot I was worried about
that so let's do the minecart thing now

326
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
that so let's do the minecart thing now
 

327
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,610
that so let's do the minecart thing now
see how that works all right we got the

328
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:44,620
see how that works all right we got the
 

329
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,680
see how that works all right we got the
minecart and storage minecart here

330
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:46,690
minecart and storage minecart here
 

331
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,740
minecart and storage minecart here
please tell me it's filling it's full

332
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:49,750
please tell me it's filling it's full
 

333
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,870
please tell me it's filling it's full
okay good

334
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:51,880
okay good
 

335
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,380
okay good
this was supposed to mmm every time this

336
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,390
this was supposed to mmm every time this
 

337
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,550
this was supposed to mmm every time this
power turns on it was supposed to send

338
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,560
power turns on it was supposed to send
 

339
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,820
power turns on it was supposed to send
power through here down and to the power

340
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:08,830
power through here down and to the power
 

341
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,380
power through here down and to the power
rail below but it doesn't seem like it's

342
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,390
rail below but it doesn't seem like it's
 

343
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,970
rail below but it doesn't seem like it's
launching it let's let's change it let's

344
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:14,980
launching it let's let's change it let's
 

345
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,300
launching it let's let's change it let's
change this to for next time this turns

346
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,310
change this to for next time this turns
 

347
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,060
change this to for next time this turns
on let's see if it turns the power wheel

348
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,070
on let's see if it turns the power wheel
 

349
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,770
on let's see if it turns the power wheel
on I think the minecart did move it just

350
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:22,780
on I think the minecart did move it just
 

351
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,300
on I think the minecart did move it just
need more time should happen any second

352
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,310
need more time should happen any second
 

353
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,550
need more time should happen any second
so every time we brew a set of awkward

354
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,560
so every time we brew a set of awkward
 

355
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,370
so every time we brew a set of awkward
potions my church should depart from

356
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,380
potions my church should depart from
 

357
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,900
potions my church should depart from
here it's only gonna run when this

358
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:33,910
here it's only gonna run when this
 

359
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,910
here it's only gonna run when this
systems running okay there it goes I

360
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
systems running okay there it goes I
 

361
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,590
systems running okay there it goes I
don't want this running all the time

362
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
don't want this running all the time
 

363
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,390
don't want this running all the time
because I find that really annoying when

364
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,400
because I find that really annoying when
 

365
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,460
because I find that really annoying when
you have a minecart running all the time

366
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,470
you have a minecart running all the time
 

367
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,510
you have a minecart running all the time
so it's gonna make its way through all

368
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:45,520
so it's gonna make its way through all
 

369
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,250
so it's gonna make its way through all
these drop-off zones it's dropping off

370
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,260
these drop-off zones it's dropping off
 

371
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,230
these drop-off zones it's dropping off
the potions into this hopper here and as

372
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
the potions into this hopper here and as
 

373
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,350
the potions into this hopper here and as
it's dropping it off there's always one

374
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,360
it's dropping it off there's always one
 

375
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,710
it's dropping it off there's always one
one potion in this hopper and that

376
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
one potion in this hopper and that
 

377
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,420
one potion in this hopper and that
that's how it knows it's in drop-off

378
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,430
that's how it knows it's in drop-off
 

379
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,140
that's how it knows it's in drop-off
mode if there's no items in this hopper

380
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,150
mode if there's no items in this hopper
 

381
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,790
mode if there's no items in this hopper
there's no potions that means it's done

382
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:05,800
there's no potions that means it's done
 

383
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,870
there's no potions that means it's done
dropping off and then this this power

384
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:09,880
dropping off and then this this power
 

385
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,120
dropping off and then this this power
rail turns on and the minecart takes off

386
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,130
rail turns on and the minecart takes off
 

387
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,670
rail turns on and the minecart takes off
if there's two or more items in here it

388
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:14,680
if there's two or more items in here it
 

389
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,960
if there's two or more items in here it
also takes off because this is the thing

390
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:18,970
also takes off because this is the thing
 

391
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,040
also takes off because this is the thing
I think I had the most trouble

392
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,050
I think I had the most trouble
 

393
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,650
I think I had the most trouble
explaining last episode oh wow it came

394
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:22,660
explaining last episode oh wow it came
 

395
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,190
explaining last episode oh wow it came
back sorry I only had three in mmm

396
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:26,200
back sorry I only had three in mmm
 

397
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,220
back sorry I only had three in mmm
that's less than ideal

398
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,230

 

399
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,569

see since it's empty it just goes over

400
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:36,579
see since it's empty it just goes over
 

401
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,579
see since it's empty it just goes over
top these these are powered by default

402
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:38,589
top these these are powered by default
 

403
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,939
top these these are powered by default
but if if there is an item in the

404
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:41,949
but if if there is an item in the
 

405
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:45,990
but if if there is an item in the
minecarts it'll send an item to this

406
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
minecarts it'll send an item to this
 

407
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,259
minecarts it'll send an item to this
hopper this turns that compared Iran and

408
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:48,269
hopper this turns that compared Iran and
 

409
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,150
hopper this turns that compared Iran and
then there this comparator goes to a

410
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,160
then there this comparator goes to a
 

411
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,650
then there this comparator goes to a
redstone torch above so if items are

412
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,660
redstone torch above so if items are
 

413
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,389
redstone torch above so if items are
passing through the hopper this power

414
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:57,399
passing through the hopper this power
 

415
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,389
passing through the hopper this power
rail turns off because that redstone

416
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
rail turns off because that redstone
 

417
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,699
rail turns off because that redstone
torch goes to this wire which is what

418
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:02,709
torch goes to this wire which is what
 

419
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:06,269
torch goes to this wire which is what
powers this if there's let's see if

420
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:06,279
powers this if there's let's see if
 

421
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,509
powers this if there's let's see if
rings if we can see it happen see it

422
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
rings if we can see it happen see it
 

423
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,300
rings if we can see it happen see it
stops it unloads I mean it picked up a

424
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,310
stops it unloads I mean it picked up a
 

425
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,220
stops it unloads I mean it picked up a
bit more this time yeah it's got fully

426
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,230
bit more this time yeah it's got fully
 

427
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,370
bit more this time yeah it's got fully
fully filled up so that comparators on

428
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,380
fully filled up so that comparators on
 

429
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,870
fully filled up so that comparators on
now that's done dropping stuff off

430
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:21,880
now that's done dropping stuff off
 

431
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,269
now that's done dropping stuff off
there's no items in this hopper so that

432
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:24,279
there's no items in this hopper so that
 

433
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,360
there's no items in this hopper so that
goes that goes back off torch turns on

434
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,370
goes that goes back off torch turns on
 

435
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,319
goes that goes back off torch turns on
and it powers the power rail again the

436
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:31,329
and it powers the power rail again the
 

437
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,850
and it powers the power rail again the
thing I'm worried about is this minecart

438
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:32,860
thing I'm worried about is this minecart
 

439
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,439
thing I'm worried about is this minecart
getting stuck on one of these drop-off

440
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:34,449
getting stuck on one of these drop-off
 

441
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:40,319
getting stuck on one of these drop-off
zones which should be pretty rare with

442
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:40,329
zones which should be pretty rare with
 

443
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,090
zones which should be pretty rare with
this setup

444
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,100

 

445
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,350

all right maybe let's this watch this

446
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
all right maybe let's this watch this
 

447
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,939
all right maybe let's this watch this
for a little bit see if we spot any

448
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:47,949
for a little bit see if we spot any
 

449
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,180
for a little bit see if we spot any
problems or anything it's starting to

450
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,190
problems or anything it's starting to
 

451
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,129
problems or anything it's starting to
fill up the station's here which is good

452
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:53,139
fill up the station's here which is good
 

453
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,960
fill up the station's here which is good
we need these all to fill up before we

454
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:54,970
we need these all to fill up before we
 

455
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,220
we need these all to fill up before we
turn the brewing on for the first time

456
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,230
turn the brewing on for the first time
 

457
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,009
turn the brewing on for the first time
good good so we're just about halfway

458
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:02,019
good good so we're just about halfway
 

459
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,840
good good so we're just about halfway
there I think and it seems to be running

460
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:06,850
there I think and it seems to be running
 

461
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,000
there I think and it seems to be running
okay I want to see I've been playing

462
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,010
okay I want to see I've been playing
 

463
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,559
okay I want to see I've been playing
around with the timing on this let's see

464
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:10,569
around with the timing on this let's see
 

465
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:15,720
around with the timing on this let's see
if it picks up a full chest of potions

466
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:15,730
if it picks up a full chest of potions
 

467
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,009
if it picks up a full chest of potions
or not no darn it okay that time it

468
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:20,019
or not no darn it okay that time it
 

469
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,610
or not no darn it okay that time it
picked up nine it looked like four eight

470
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,620
picked up nine it looked like four eight
 

471
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,660
picked up nine it looked like four eight
so we're gonna go down here we're gonna

472
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:24,670
so we're gonna go down here we're gonna
 

473
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,519
so we're gonna go down here we're gonna
change the timing on on the clock again

474
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:28,529
change the timing on on the clock again
 

475
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,050
change the timing on on the clock again
the problem with this it's just the

476
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,060
the problem with this it's just the
 

477
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,550
the problem with this it's just the
timing isn't jiving very well it's that

478
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:35,560
timing isn't jiving very well it's that
 

479
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,509
timing isn't jiving very well it's that
five cobble in it just so happens that

480
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
five cobble in it just so happens that
 

481
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,220
five cobble in it just so happens that
the time it takes it to do the loop is

482
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,230
the time it takes it to do the loop is
 

483
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,309
the time it takes it to do the loop is
like rate when it returns it's ready to

484
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:44,319
like rate when it returns it's ready to
 

485
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,570
like rate when it returns it's ready to
go again

486
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:45,580
go again
 

487
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,550
go again
so if we delay it a little bit it'll

488
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,560
so if we delay it a little bit it'll
 

489
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,199
so if we delay it a little bit it'll
give it time to pick up potions out of

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:49,209
give it time to pick up potions out of

00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:54,360
give it time to pick up potions out of

and after working on eco Corp on the
 

843
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,020
and after working on eco Corp on the
minecraft server I think this is what

844
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,030
minecraft server I think this is what
 

845
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,550
minecraft server I think this is what
I've done that I haven't shown just this

846
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:26,560
I've done that I haven't shown just this

buildings only maybe 20 by 20 this one's

852
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:34,870
buildings only maybe 20 by 20 this one's
 

853
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,680
buildings only maybe 20 by 20 this one's
like 40 by 40 with with a the layout we

854
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:37,690
like 40 by 40 with with a the layout we
 

855
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,900
like 40 by 40 with with a the layout we
had here an isochoric me for ever to

856
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:42,910
had here an isochoric me for ever to
 

857
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,560
had here an isochoric me for ever to
work on or to finish it's I like to put

858
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,570
work on or to finish it's I like to put
 

859
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,060
work on or to finish it's I like to put
a lot of detail on my builds I'd rather

860
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,070
a lot of detail on my builds I'd rather
 

861
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,190
a lot of detail on my builds I'd rather
build something smaller and spend a lot

862
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,200
build something smaller and spend a lot
 

863
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,440
build something smaller and spend a lot
of time on it and get it the way I like

864
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,450
of time on it and get it the way I like
 

865
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,020
of time on it and get it the way I like
it then just build big plain walls and

866
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,030
it then just build big plain walls and
 

867
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,430
it then just build big plain walls and
that kind of thing

868
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:56,440
that kind of thing
 

869
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,040
that kind of thing
so I think if we do a 40 by 40 with this

870
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,050
so I think if we do a 40 by 40 with this
 

871
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,090
so I think if we do a 40 by 40 with this
we're gonna have problems so we should

872
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,100
we're gonna have problems so we should
 

873
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,730
we're gonna have problems so we should
we'll fight a little bit but yeah we'll
