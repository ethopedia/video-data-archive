hey everyone it's been a while since we
last did an enchantment so let's start

4
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
last did an enchantment so let's start
 

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,980
last did an enchantment so let's start
out the episode here with the 42 and

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:14,990
out the episode here with the 42 and
 

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,490
out the episode here with the 42 and
it's pretty mediocre but it's going to

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:19,500
it's pretty mediocre but it's going to
 

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,710
it's pretty mediocre but it's going to
be a great episode don't let that get

you down okay that last one is a bit of
 

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,560
you down okay that last one is a bit of
a bus so we're going to try again 43

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:27,570
a bus so we're going to try again 43
 

15
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,709
a bus so we're going to try again 43
this time dang it man okay I am

16
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
this time dang it man okay I am
 

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,569
this time dang it man okay I am
determined to get a good pick to start

18
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:38,579
determined to get a good pick to start
 

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,040
determined to get a good pick to start
off this episode so we're going to do

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,050
off this episode so we're going to do
 

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,290
off this episode so we're going to do
one more one last one this is going to

22
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,300
one more one last one this is going to
 

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:51,080
one more one last one this is going to
be good 144 ah don't get me wrong I do

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,090
be good 144 ah don't get me wrong I do
 

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,700
be good 144 ah don't get me wrong I do
like these ones I just go through them

26
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:52,710
like these ones I just go through them
 

27
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,860
like these ones I just go through them
so quick I want efficiency for

28
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:54,870
so quick I want efficiency for
 

29
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,290
so quick I want efficiency for
unbreaking 3 that's the goal but ah

30
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,300
unbreaking 3 that's the goal but ah
 

31
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,820
unbreaking 3 that's the goal but ah
it'll do alright I know something we can

32
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830
it'll do alright I know something we can
 

33
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,600
it'll do alright I know something we can
do to make up for the so-so pics this is

34
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:08,610
do to make up for the so-so pics this is
 

35
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,660
do to make up for the so-so pics this is
going to be good oh I've been wanting to

36
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,670
going to be good oh I've been wanting to
 

37
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,480
going to be good oh I've been wanting to
do this for a long long time first stack

38
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,490
do this for a long long time first stack
 

39
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,570
do this for a long long time first stack
of TNT in the LP before this the most

40
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:20,580
of TNT in the LP before this the most
 

41
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,840
of TNT in the LP before this the most
I've ever had it any time is usually

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:22,850
I've ever had it any time is usually
 

43
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,460
I've ever had it any time is usually
make like 20 or so I think was my most

44
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,470
make like 20 or so I think was my most
 

45
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,310
make like 20 or so I think was my most
and pretty soon we're going to be

46
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
and pretty soon we're going to be
 

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,999
and pretty soon we're going to be
rolling in this stuff oh yeah and

48
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:34,009

 

49
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,800

something I want to try out maybe to

50
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:36,810
something I want to try out maybe to
 

51
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,550
something I want to try out maybe to
start off with is some vertical chain

52
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
start off with is some vertical chain
 

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,999
start off with is some vertical chain
drilling with TNT let's see let's go

54
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,009
drilling with TNT let's see let's go
 

55
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,730
drilling with TNT let's see let's go
over here it's a fine art to master I

56
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:49,740
over here it's a fine art to master I
 

57
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,700
over here it's a fine art to master I
don't know I think I've experimented

58
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,710
don't know I think I've experimented
 

59
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,859
don't know I think I've experimented
with it before but basically we got to

60
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:54,869
with it before but basically we got to
 

61
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,319
with it before but basically we got to
remove all this stone here we don't need

62
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,329
remove all this stone here we don't need
 

63
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,010
remove all this stone here we don't need
it so I'm going to go to the top and I

64
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
it so I'm going to go to the top and I
 

65
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,660
it so I'm going to go to the top and I
will see you soon

66
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:04,670

 

67
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,920

okay so this is right below the mob

68
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:06,930
okay so this is right below the mob
 

69
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,999
okay so this is right below the mob
system y59 here we got a dig straight

70
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,009
system y59 here we got a dig straight
 

71
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,339
system y59 here we got a dig straight
down and try all out all the blocks

72
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:13,349
down and try all out all the blocks
 

73
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,170
down and try all out all the blocks
below us here um

74
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,180
below us here um
 

75
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,670
below us here um
man I just whizzed by when they come

76
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
man I just whizzed by when they come
 

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,770
man I just whizzed by when they come
down I'm gonna try do a 5x5 area I don't

78
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,780
down I'm gonna try do a 5x5 area I don't
 

79
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,020
down I'm gonna try do a 5x5 area I don't
know probably have to remove a few of

80
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,030
know probably have to remove a few of
 

81
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,390
know probably have to remove a few of
them by hand but we'll see how this goes

82
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,400
them by hand but we'll see how this goes
 

83
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,449
them by hand but we'll see how this goes
so I have water ready and enderpearls

84
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,459
so I have water ready and enderpearls
 

85
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,070
so I have water ready and enderpearls
I'm going to dig straight down so if we

86
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm going to dig straight down so if we
 

87
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,150
I'm going to dig straight down so if we
fall in lava should be able to hear it

88
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,160
fall in lava should be able to hear it
 

89
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,650
fall in lava should be able to hear it
there we go

90
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:44,660
there we go
 

91
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,970
there we go
actually that's not that much it's not

92
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:46,980
actually that's not that much it's not
 

93
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,110
actually that's not that much it's not
as far as I thought it was going to be

94
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,120
as far as I thought it was going to be
 

95
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,410
as far as I thought it was going to be
oh yeah

96
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,420
oh yeah
 

97
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,800
oh yeah
so I know I've done this before and if

98
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:54,810
so I know I've done this before and if
 

99
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,930
so I know I've done this before and if
you remember my 50k specialty can't

100
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:56,940
you remember my 50k specialty can't
 

101
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,420
you remember my 50k specialty can't
cannon run one how the pit explodes

102
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,430
cannon run one how the pit explodes
 

103
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,770
cannon run one how the pit explodes
towards the end of it of the run

104
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:02,780
towards the end of it of the run
 

105
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,800
towards the end of it of the run
basically what I was doing is it was two

106
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:06,810
basically what I was doing is it was two
 

107
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,740
basically what I was doing is it was two
snow blocks at TNT then two snow blocks

108
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:09,750
snow blocks at TNT then two snow blocks
 

109
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,569
snow blocks at TNT then two snow blocks
then the TNT we're going to use let's

110
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:14,579
then the TNT we're going to use let's
 

111
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,849
then the TNT we're going to use let's
see how should we do this we want each

112
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:16,859
see how should we do this we want each
 

113
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,180
see how should we do this we want each
TNT to try blow up blow out a 5 by 5 by

114
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,190
TNT to try blow up blow out a 5 by 5 by
 

115
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,819
TNT to try blow up blow out a 5 by 5 by
5 area so the TNT should explode at this

116
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:25,829
5 area so the TNT should explode at this
 

117
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,449
5 area so the TNT should explode at this
height so maybe we will drill out a 3x3

118
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:29,459
height so maybe we will drill out a 3x3
 

119
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,430
height so maybe we will drill out a 3x3
by hand and see how this goes

120
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
by hand and see how this goes
 

121
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,400
by hand and see how this goes
first of all this probably is not going

122
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,410
first of all this probably is not going
 

123
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,539
first of all this probably is not going
to work very good because I'm just

124
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:38,549
to work very good because I'm just
 

125
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:49,420
to work very good because I'm just
winging it really all right do that

126
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,430

 

127
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,539

I guess I'll put the TNT here I don't

128
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:52,549
I guess I'll put the TNT here I don't
 

129
00:03:52,549 --> 00:04:02,890
I guess I'll put the TNT here I don't
know yeah yeah go up see what what

130
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:02,900
know yeah yeah go up see what what
 

131
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,539
know yeah yeah go up see what what
should this be I just want to get this

132
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:04,549
should this be I just want to get this
 

133
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,819
should this be I just want to get this
exact so for future reference I'll be

134
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:06,829
exact so for future reference I'll be
 

135
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,679
exact so for future reference I'll be
able to do a lot quicker once I have it

136
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:08,689
able to do a lot quicker once I have it
 

137
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:15,360
able to do a lot quicker once I have it
figured out I'm going to go up one I

138
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,370

 

139
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,890

guess I guess this is the next spot we

140
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:17,900
guess I guess this is the next spot we
 

141
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,439
guess I guess this is the next spot we
would drill out and I'm curious to see

142
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:23,449
would drill out and I'm curious to see
 

143
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,990
would drill out and I'm curious to see
what kind of explosion this will do and

144
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
what kind of explosion this will do and
 

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,310
what kind of explosion this will do and
if it will chain or not all right so the

146
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,320
if it will chain or not all right so the
 

147
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,670
if it will chain or not all right so the
next one would go here repeat the

148
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
next one would go here repeat the
 

149
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,740
next one would go here repeat the
pattern as many times as you want and

150
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:38,750
pattern as many times as you want and
 

151
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,560
pattern as many times as you want and
see what happens so I'll finish the rest

152
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,570
see what happens so I'll finish the rest
 

153
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,820
see what happens so I'll finish the rest
and we will try it out yeah so this

154
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
and we will try it out yeah so this
 

155
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,460
and we will try it out yeah so this
chain is only three T it's not much of a

156
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,470
chain is only three T it's not much of a
 

157
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,350
chain is only three T it's not much of a
chain really but if it doesn't work well

158
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
chain really but if it doesn't work well
 

159
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,420
chain really but if it doesn't work well
we don't want it to keep going anyway so

160
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,430
we don't want it to keep going anyway so
 

161
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,129
we don't want it to keep going anyway so
I guess we'll just put we'll use a lever

162
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:00,139
I guess we'll just put we'll use a lever
 

163
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:06,700
I guess we'll just put we'll use a lever
and let's see we're using leaves because

164
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:06,710
and let's see we're using leaves because
 

165
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,969
and let's see we're using leaves because
they have a blast resistance of one so

166
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:09,979
they have a blast resistance of one so
 

167
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,839
they have a blast resistance of one so
leaves and snow or two block sets are

168
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:12,849
leaves and snow or two block sets are
 

169
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:19,480
leaves and snow or two block sets are
extremely easy to break with TNT we

170
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,490
extremely easy to break with TNT we
 

171
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,129
extremely easy to break with TNT we
might have to choose a block that has a

172
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:21,139
might have to choose a block that has a
 

173
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,279
might have to choose a block that has a
higher resistance nope no distance is

174
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:27,289
higher resistance nope no distance is
 

175
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,310
higher resistance nope no distance is
too great it just can't can't do it it'd

176
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
too great it just can't can't do it it'd
 

177
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,050
too great it just can't can't do it it'd
blow up it blew out the five by five

178
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,060
blow up it blew out the five by five
 

179
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,700
blow up it blew out the five by five
pretty good though of course we have to

180
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:36,710
pretty good though of course we have to
 

181
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,350
pretty good though of course we have to
take out a three by three but the amount

182
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,360
take out a three by three but the amount
 

183
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,100
take out a three by three but the amount
of blocks compared to if you did not do

184
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,110
of blocks compared to if you did not do
 

185
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:50,469
of blocks compared to if you did not do
that is quite a bit more I think yeah so

186
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
that is quite a bit more I think yeah so
 

187
00:05:50,479 --> 00:06:01,499
that is quite a bit more I think yeah so
it doesn't chain but it's not bad

188
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:01,509

 

189
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:12,100

one more we'll stay on it this time it's

190
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,110
one more we'll stay on it this time it's
 

191
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,899
one more we'll stay on it this time it's
quite a bit of land so let me figure out

192
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:13,909
quite a bit of land so let me figure out
 

193
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,430
quite a bit of land so let me figure out
how many blocks that actually blows up

194
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
how many blocks that actually blows up
 

195
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,580
how many blocks that actually blows up
on average okay so for that set up it

196
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:21,590
on average okay so for that set up it
 

197
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,939
on average okay so for that set up it
mines out about 85 to 90 blocks per TNT

198
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:24,949
mines out about 85 to 90 blocks per TNT
 

199
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,830
mines out about 85 to 90 blocks per TNT
which is a pretty good but in order to

200
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
which is a pretty good but in order to
 

201
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,110
which is a pretty good but in order to
get that effect we actually need to mine

202
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,120
get that effect we actually need to mine
 

203
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,170
get that effect we actually need to mine
out twenty nine blocks ourselves in

204
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,180
out twenty nine blocks ourselves in
 

205
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,990
out twenty nine blocks ourselves in
addition and there is some remnants in

206
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
addition and there is some remnants in
 

207
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,550
addition and there is some remnants in
the five by five by five area usually

208
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:41,560
the five by five by five area usually
 

209
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,559
the five by five by five area usually
looks like about seven eight or nine

210
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:44,569
looks like about seven eight or nine
 

211
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,879
looks like about seven eight or nine
blocks give or take a few

212
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:47,889
blocks give or take a few
 

213
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,100
blocks give or take a few
so that's pretty good it does not chain

214
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,110
so that's pretty good it does not chain
 

215
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,290
so that's pretty good it does not chain
no in order to get it to chain we

216
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,300
no in order to get it to chain we
 

217
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,529
no in order to get it to chain we
probably have to move or space the TNT

218
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:56,539
probably have to move or space the TNT
 

219
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,350
probably have to move or space the TNT
one block closer or else get rid of some

220
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
one block closer or else get rid of some
 

221
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,260
one block closer or else get rid of some
of the leaves in between which isn't

222
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,270
of the leaves in between which isn't
 

223
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,809
of the leaves in between which isn't
really an option because we need them to

224
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:04,819
really an option because we need them to
 

225
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,290
really an option because we need them to
pillar up so because idea is you dig

226
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,300
pillar up so because idea is you dig
 

227
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,809
pillar up so because idea is you dig
down then you pillar up with your TNT

228
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:10,819
down then you pillar up with your TNT
 

229
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:16,390
down then you pillar up with your TNT
space properly and and whatnot you're

230
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
space properly and and whatnot you're
 

231
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,939
space properly and and whatnot you're
going to try another setup now a

232
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:18,949
going to try another setup now a
 

233
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:24,550
going to try another setup now a
different one chirps ah let's see we

234
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
different one chirps ah let's see we
 

235
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
different one chirps ah let's see we
will dig down again you know I'm taking

236
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,250
will dig down again you know I'm taking
 

237
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,370
will dig down again you know I'm taking
the iron I hit the blow it up and this

238
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,380
the iron I hit the blow it up and this
 

239
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,140
the iron I hit the blow it up and this
time we have soil we're just going to

240
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,150
time we have soil we're just going to
 

241
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,360
time we have soil we're just going to
interfere but well okay so this time I

242
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,370
interfere but well okay so this time I
 

243
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,610
interfere but well okay so this time I
want to try let's see we will do let's

244
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:45,620
want to try let's see we will do let's
 

245
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,670
want to try let's see we will do let's
just get this here for now get some

246
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:48,680
just get this here for now get some
 

247
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,010
just get this here for now get some
light so you guys can see the TNT will

248
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,020
light so you guys can see the TNT will
 

249
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,969
light so you guys can see the TNT will
explode at this height again I'm just

250
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:57,979
explode at this height again I'm just
 

251
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,519
explode at this height again I'm just
going to mine out four blocks like that

252
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:00,529
going to mine out four blocks like that
 

253
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,649
going to mine out four blocks like that
so the TNT will explode where my head's

254
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:02,659
so the TNT will explode where my head's
 

255
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,290
so the TNT will explode where my head's
at ideally

256
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300

 

257
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,249

and we will see how this works

258
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:10,259
and we will see how this works
 

259
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,749
and we will see how this works
see we go what would it be spaced closer

260
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
see we go what would it be spaced closer
 

261
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:27,200
see we go what would it be spaced closer
then yeah would hmm what am I doing here

262
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,210
then yeah would hmm what am I doing here
 

263
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,589
then yeah would hmm what am I doing here
um okay well let's try space at three

264
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
um okay well let's try space at three
 

265
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,969
um okay well let's try space at three
blocks apart so again we'll put another

266
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:32,979
blocks apart so again we'll put another
 

267
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,389
blocks apart so again we'll put another
one here and just see what gets left

268
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
one here and just see what gets left
 

269
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:48,440
one here and just see what gets left
over one two dig dig dig dig leaf TNT

270
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,450
over one two dig dig dig dig leaf TNT
 

271
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:56,639
over one two dig dig dig dig leaf TNT
leaf leaf beat and tea kind of made a

272
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:56,649
leaf leaf beat and tea kind of made a
 

273
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,160
leaf leaf beat and tea kind of made a
mess here just for the sake of testing

274
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,170
mess here just for the sake of testing
 

275
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,259
mess here just for the sake of testing
we'll fill it in the soil is going to

276
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:01,269
we'll fill it in the soil is going to
 

277
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:08,579
we'll fill it in the soil is going to
interfere there feels wrong to place

278
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:08,589
interfere there feels wrong to place
 

279
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,439
interfere there feels wrong to place
blocks when our goal is to get rid of

280
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:10,449
blocks when our goal is to get rid of
 

281
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,199
blocks when our goal is to get rid of
blocks okay so I think we had four that

282
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:13,209
blocks okay so I think we had four that
 

283
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:19,310
blocks okay so I think we had four that
time in that chain see what happens

284
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
time in that chain see what happens
 

285
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:27,060
time in that chain see what happens
see fill chain yeah it's gaining now

286
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,070
see fill chain yeah it's gaining now
 

287
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,680
see fill chain yeah it's gaining now
looks like it to go quite a few blocks

288
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:28,690
looks like it to go quite a few blocks
 

289
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,759
looks like it to go quite a few blocks
let's go down get some light again yeah

290
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:35,769
let's go down get some light again yeah
 

291
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:41,220
let's go down get some light again yeah
so it comes close to a 5x5 but it leaves

292
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,230
so it comes close to a 5x5 but it leaves
 

293
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,380
so it comes close to a 5x5 but it leaves
a lot more residue in the corners and

294
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,390
a lot more residue in the corners and
 

295
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,100
a lot more residue in the corners and
obviously doesn't do doesn't do as good

296
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,110
obviously doesn't do doesn't do as good
 

297
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,290
obviously doesn't do doesn't do as good
of a job and it cost more TNT because we

298
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,300
of a job and it cost more TNT because we
 

299
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
of a job and it cost more TNT because we
had to use for for pretty much the same

300
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,310
had to use for for pretty much the same
 

301
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,389
had to use for for pretty much the same
amount of space but it's a lot easier to

302
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
amount of space but it's a lot easier to
 

303
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,939
amount of space but it's a lot easier to
do a lot less to my notes uh-huh

304
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:07,949

 

305
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,009

okay one more chain mining experiment

306
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:11,019
okay one more chain mining experiment
 

307
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,460
okay one more chain mining experiment
here I kind of forgot that the center of

308
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,470
here I kind of forgot that the center of
 

309
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,230
here I kind of forgot that the center of
the mob system is not centered with this

310
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
the mob system is not centered with this
 

311
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,269
the mob system is not centered with this
room down here the center of the mob

312
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:18,279
room down here the center of the mob
 

313
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,600
room down here the center of the mob
systems right where that tube is there

314
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:20,610
systems right where that tube is there
 

315
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,439
systems right where that tube is there
so I'd set up another test here let's go

316
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:25,449
so I'd set up another test here let's go
 

317
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:33,480
so I'd set up another test here let's go
up oh that looked really weird very very

318
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,490
up oh that looked really weird very very
 

319
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,720
up oh that looked really weird very very
weird yeah so we were down there we're

320
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,730
weird yeah so we were down there we're
 

321
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,530
weird yeah so we were down there we're
going to do a horizontal chain mining

322
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:40,540
going to do a horizontal chain mining
 

323
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,160
going to do a horizontal chain mining
thing same setup as before I think they

324
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,170
thing same setup as before I think they
 

325
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,780
thing same setup as before I think they
will chain pretty good because they're

326
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:45,790
will chain pretty good because they're
 

327
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,550
will chain pretty good because they're
only one two three four blocks apart no

328
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
only one two three four blocks apart no
 

329
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,460
only one two three four blocks apart no
five blocks apart and TNT is usually

330
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,470
five blocks apart and TNT is usually
 

331
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,850
five blocks apart and TNT is usually
pretty good at that range ahaha still

332
00:10:59,850 --> 00:10:59,860
pretty good at that range ahaha still
 

333
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,819
pretty good at that range ahaha still
glad I have TT again I've missed it so

334
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:02,829
glad I have TT again I've missed it so
 

335
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:09,439
glad I have TT again I've missed it so
much

336
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,449

 

337
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,900

alright so I only set up a few few

338
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,910
alright so I only set up a few few
 

339
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:20,730
alright so I only set up a few few
chambers and I don't really want to

340
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:20,740
chambers and I don't really want to
 

341
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,749
chambers and I don't really want to
leave this is the part where I blow up

342
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:26,759
leave this is the part where I blow up
 

343
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,470
leave this is the part where I blow up
okay we're going to do another

344
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
okay we're going to do another
 

345
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
okay we're going to do another
experiment here we're going to block in

346
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,130
experiment here we're going to block in
 

347
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,829
experiment here we're going to block in
the corner and see if we die maybe we'll

348
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:34,839
the corner and see if we die maybe we'll
 

349
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,189
the corner and see if we die maybe we'll
go in two blocks how about that okay

350
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:40,199

 

351
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,579

dented it then bounced this way too

352
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:44,589
dented it then bounced this way too
 

353
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:52,530
dented it then bounced this way too
great yeah we're fine very nice

354
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:52,540

 

355
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,880

good chain good chain not a whole lot of

356
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:56,890
good chain good chain not a whole lot of
 

357
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,190
good chain good chain not a whole lot of
residue left either which is very good

358
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
residue left either which is very good
 

359
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,950
residue left either which is very good
that might become my new standard when

360
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:01,960
that might become my new standard when
 

361
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,270
that might become my new standard when
I'm mining out a large area because

362
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm mining out a large area because
 

363
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm mining out a large area because
before I was doing what was it three by

364
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,130
before I was doing what was it three by
 

365
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,770
before I was doing what was it three by
four high area and I would dig one one

366
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:16,780
four high area and I would dig one one
 

367
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,070
four high area and I would dig one one
wide by two high tunnel for myself and

368
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,080
wide by two high tunnel for myself and
 

369
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,450
wide by two high tunnel for myself and
space the TNT every five blocks like

370
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:24,460
space the TNT every five blocks like
 

371
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,310
space the TNT every five blocks like
that I think is what I was doing before

372
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
that I think is what I was doing before
 

373
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,720
that I think is what I was doing before
this new method though there's a lot

374
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:30,730
this new method though there's a lot
 

375
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,790
this new method though there's a lot
more efficient although it does require

376
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
more efficient although it does require
 

377
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,740
more efficient although it does require
more manual digging setting it up let's

378
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,750
more manual digging setting it up let's
 

379
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:51,590
more manual digging setting it up let's
do it again

380
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600

 

381
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,880

TNT is awesome Oh failed chain Oh field

382
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:56,890
TNT is awesome Oh failed chain Oh field
 

383
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:05,910
TNT is awesome Oh failed chain Oh field
mob system oh lava pool nuts oh dang

384
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
mob system oh lava pool nuts oh dang
 

385
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,000
mob system oh lava pool nuts oh dang
that better not leak down I think it's

386
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,010
that better not leak down I think it's
 

387
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,120
that better not leak down I think it's
okay yeah there's no holes there mm-hmm

388
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,130
okay yeah there's no holes there mm-hmm
 

389
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:23,960
okay yeah there's no holes there mm-hmm
alright would blew up the leaves

390
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:23,970
alright would blew up the leaves
 

391
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,140
alright would blew up the leaves
alright let's fix this was good we'll

392
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,150
alright let's fix this was good we'll
 

393
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,020
alright let's fix this was good we'll
replace this with glass or ice when it's

394
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,030
replace this with glass or ice when it's
 

395
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:41,070
replace this with glass or ice when it's
all done but just for now and again last

396
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,080
all done but just for now and again last
 

397
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,269
all done but just for now and again last
one for today might fall

398
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,279
one for today might fall
 

399
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,320
one for today might fall
no word

400
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,330

 

401
00:13:52,330 --> 00:14:06,960

oh yeah gotta close that off again I'll

402
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:06,970
oh yeah gotta close that off again I'll
 

403
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,410
oh yeah gotta close that off again I'll
check it in just a sec okay

404
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:09,420
check it in just a sec okay
 

405
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,150
check it in just a sec okay
there was a lava pool here I filled in

406
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
there was a lava pool here I filled in
 

407
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,100
there was a lava pool here I filled in
there's only one deep and that lab over

408
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,110
there's only one deep and that lab over
 

409
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,000
there's only one deep and that lab over
up there

410
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,010
up there
 

411
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,970
up there
I think it's contained for now very good

412
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:23,980
I think it's contained for now very good
 

413
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,010
I think it's contained for now very good
okay so we got a lot of land cleared

414
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,020
okay so we got a lot of land cleared
 

415
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,830
okay so we got a lot of land cleared
using about half a stack of TNT it's

416
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:31,840
using about half a stack of TNT it's
 

417
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,220
using about half a stack of TNT it's
good all right so I'll get rid of this

418
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,230
good all right so I'll get rid of this
 

419
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,470
good all right so I'll get rid of this
bottom layer yet I wanted to keep that

420
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
bottom layer yet I wanted to keep that
 

421
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,450
bottom layer yet I wanted to keep that
so I had I would have something to stand

422
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:42,460
so I had I would have something to stand
 

423
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,200
so I had I would have something to stand
on and we will see how it looks

424
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,210

 

425
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,940

yeah so we got a lot of land cleared

426
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:50,950
yeah so we got a lot of land cleared
 

427
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,140
yeah so we got a lot of land cleared
here today a lot of space I put in some

428
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,150
here today a lot of space I put in some
 

429
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,450
here today a lot of space I put in some
glass tubes just to get a feel for how

430
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:57,460
glass tubes just to get a feel for how
 

431
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,570
glass tubes just to get a feel for how
it'll be when it's all done but it's

432
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:00,580
it'll be when it's all done but it's
 

433
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,150
it'll be when it's all done but it's
very dark up up high there so you can't

434
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,160
very dark up up high there so you can't
 

435
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,880
very dark up up high there so you can't
really see much with the way it is right

436
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:05,890
really see much with the way it is right
 

437
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,040
really see much with the way it is right
now this room is going to be pretty tall

438
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,050
now this room is going to be pretty tall
 

439
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,590
now this room is going to be pretty tall
pretty high up is what I'm planning

440
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
pretty high up is what I'm planning
 

441
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,750
pretty high up is what I'm planning
because we're going to be extending out

442
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
because we're going to be extending out
 

443
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,700
because we're going to be extending out
these walls all four of them this way

444
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:17,710
these walls all four of them this way
 

445
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,140
these walls all four of them this way
this way this way in this way and it'll

446
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,150
this way this way in this way and it'll
 

447
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,780
this way this way in this way and it'll
be a fairly big room the centerpiece is

448
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:24,790
be a fairly big room the centerpiece is
 

449
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,570
be a fairly big room the centerpiece is
only going to be a small part of it I

450
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:27,580
only going to be a small part of it I
 

451
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,730
only going to be a small part of it I
think but right below the mob system

452
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:32,740
think but right below the mob system
 

453
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,610
think but right below the mob system
we're going to have the mob sorter which

454
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:35,620
we're going to have the mob sorter which
 

455
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,740
we're going to have the mob sorter which
will split the mobs into the three tubes

456
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:40,750
will split the mobs into the three tubes
 

457
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,390
will split the mobs into the three tubes
here if we have it on and then right

458
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,400
here if we have it on and then right
 

459
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,040
here if we have it on and then right
below that will probably have a ceiling

460
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,050
below that will probably have a ceiling
 

461
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,470
below that will probably have a ceiling
so it's not going to be quite that high

462
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,480
so it's not going to be quite that high
 

463
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,860
so it's not going to be quite that high
up but it'll probably be maybe now

464
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:52,870
up but it'll probably be maybe now
 

465
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,860
up but it'll probably be maybe now
between five and ten blocks lower we'll

466
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:55,870
between five and ten blocks lower we'll
 

467
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,470
between five and ten blocks lower we'll
have another ceiling and that will be

468
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
have another ceiling and that will be
 

469
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,640
have another ceiling and that will be
the fancier looking one for this room

470
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:02,650
the fancier looking one for this room
 

471
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,040
the fancier looking one for this room
and yeah this mom systems actually

472
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,050
and yeah this mom systems actually
 

473
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,510
and yeah this mom systems actually
working a lot better than I was
