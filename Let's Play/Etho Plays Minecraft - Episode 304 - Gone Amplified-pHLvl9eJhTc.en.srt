he's probably 10 to 20 now once they

38
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
he's probably 10 to 20 now once they
 

39
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,050
he's probably 10 to 20 now once they
added the new terrain generation but I

40
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,060
added the new terrain generation but I
 

41
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,120
added the new terrain generation but I
deleted all that stuff and loaded a back

42
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,130
deleted all that stuff and loaded a back
 

43
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,929
deleted all that stuff and loaded a back
up so I still do not have any of the 1.7

44
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:17,939
up so I still do not have any of the 1.7
 

45
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,880
up so I still do not have any of the 1.7
features in my world here and definitely

46
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,890
features in my world here and definitely
 

47
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,890
features in my world here and definitely
gotta do something about that I

48
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:24,900
gotta do something about that I
 

49
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,410
gotta do something about that I

stuff today we're going to just have
some fun exploring I really like

62
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
some fun exploring I really like
 

63
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,580
some fun exploring I really like
exploring in this game but I don't do it

64
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,590
exploring in this game but I don't do it
 

65
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,300
exploring in this game but I don't do it
often because it doesn't take long like

66
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,310
often because it doesn't take long like
 

67
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,100
often because it doesn't take long like
in ten minutes my world size just

68
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,110
in ten minutes my world size just
 

69
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,929
in ten minutes my world size just
increases dramatically when I'm

70
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:53,939
increases dramatically when I'm
 

71
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,990
increases dramatically when I'm
exploring and I try to do the world

72
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,000
exploring and I try to do the world
 

73
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,520
exploring and I try to do the world
downloads but now I don't know I I wait

74
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,530
downloads but now I don't know I I wait
 

75
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,100
downloads but now I don't know I I wait
I wanted to do it like do this exploring

76
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,110
I wanted to do it like do this exploring
 

77
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,840
I wanted to do it like do this exploring
thing after I released it so I released

78
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:05,850
thing after I released it so I released
 

79
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,770
thing after I released it so I released
the world download a few days ago and

80
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:08,780
the world download a few days ago and
 

81
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,999
the world download a few days ago and
even even though I didn't do the

82
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,009
even even though I didn't do the
 

83
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,290
even even though I didn't do the
exploring before had in the world

84
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
exploring before had in the world
 

85
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,910
exploring before had in the world
size was still

86
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
size was still
 

87
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,660
size was still
two big I think and no website seems to

88
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:17,670
two big I think and no website seems to
 

89
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,120
two big I think and no website seems to
be able to host it without crashing or

90
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,130
be able to host it without crashing or
 

91
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,979
be able to host it without crashing or
or anything so I don't know I tried my

92
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:24,989
or anything so I don't know I tried my
 

93
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,320
or anything so I don't know I tried my
best to stay within this area but it's

94
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,330
best to stay within this area but it's
 

95
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,420
best to stay within this area but it's
still not good enough so I think in the

96
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,430
still not good enough so I think in the
 

97
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,370
still not good enough so I think in the
future if I do a world downloads I'm

98
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,380
future if I do a world downloads I'm
 

99
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,690
future if I do a world downloads I'm
gonna have to cut some stuff out of my

100
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:32,700
gonna have to cut some stuff out of my
 

101
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,309
gonna have to cut some stuff out of my
world and just release the important

102
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
world and just release the important
 

103
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,630
world and just release the important
parts of it so the plan is we're gonna

104
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
parts of it so the plan is we're gonna
 

105
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,990
parts of it so the plan is we're gonna
go 500 blocks out in the nether here and

106
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
go 500 blocks out in the nether here and
 

107
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,610
go 500 blocks out in the nether here and
that'll be like 4000 blocks in the

108
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:43,620
that'll be like 4000 blocks in the
 

109
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,380
that'll be like 4000 blocks in the
overworld and that'll start a whole new

110
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,390
overworld and that'll start a whole new
 

111
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,110
overworld and that'll start a whole new
area for us to to check out no matter

112
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
area for us to to check out no matter
 

113
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,880
area for us to to check out no matter
where I go I'm gonna get the borders

114
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:52,890
where I go I'm gonna get the borders
 

115
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,320
where I go I'm gonna get the borders
from the 1.7 terrain changes so I

116
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,330
from the 1.7 terrain changes so I
 

117
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,729
from the 1.7 terrain changes so I
figured it'd be best just to go far outs

118
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:01,739
figured it'd be best just to go far outs
 

119
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,400
figured it'd be best just to go far outs
and try not to connect the the previous

120
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,410
and try not to connect the the previous
 

121
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,380
and try not to connect the the previous
generation with the new generation not

122
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,390
generation with the new generation not
 

123
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,990
generation with the new generation not
that it matters too much but mister here

124
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
that it matters too much but mister here
 

125
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,690
that it matters too much but mister here
that'd be best and this is the portal I

126
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:11,700
that'd be best and this is the portal I
 

127
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,630
that'd be best and this is the portal I
have prepared but before we go through

128
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
have prepared but before we go through
 

129
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,630
have prepared but before we go through
it there's one thing I want to do I'm

130
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:17,640
it there's one thing I want to do I'm
 

131
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,849
it there's one thing I want to do I'm
going to switch my world into amplified

132
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:19,859
going to switch my world into amplified
 

133
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:22,039
going to switch my world into amplified
mode like I talked about because it

134
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,049
mode like I talked about because it
 

135
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,710
mode like I talked about because it
seems it seems like a really good idea

136
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
seems it seems like a really good idea
 

137
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,039
seems it seems like a really good idea
to do that to be honest like I don't

138
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,049
to do that to be honest like I don't
 

139
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,930
to do that to be honest like I don't
know everything in amplified worlds this

140
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:29,940
know everything in amplified worlds this
 

141
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,289
know everything in amplified worlds this
looks so amazing and when I did explore

142
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,299
looks so amazing and when I did explore
 

143
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,940
looks so amazing and when I did explore
like a while ago there with the 1.7

144
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:37,950
like a while ago there with the 1.7
 

145
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,640
like a while ago there with the 1.7
changes I saw a lot of neat stuff but

146
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:40,650
changes I saw a lot of neat stuff but
 

147
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,740
changes I saw a lot of neat stuff but
nothing really outstanding like I want

148
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:42,750
nothing really outstanding like I want
 

149
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,960
nothing really outstanding like I want
to build their type of generation it was

150
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:44,970
to build their type of generation it was
 

151
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,420
to build their type of generation it was
a lot of snow biome stuff and nothing

152
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,430
a lot of snow biome stuff and nothing
 

153
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,180
a lot of snow biome stuff and nothing
really stood out too much so I think

154
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,190
really stood out too much so I think
 

155
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,130
really stood out too much so I think
amplified is definitely the way to go

156
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,140
amplified is definitely the way to go
 

157
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,440
amplified is definitely the way to go
and I had a lot of people asking me how

158
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,450
and I had a lot of people asking me how
 

159
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,360
and I had a lot of people asking me how
am I going to switch my world to

am I going to switch my world to
 

161
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,840
am I going to switch my world to
amplified I will try to record that now

162
00:03:59,840 --> 00:03:59,850
amplified I will try to record that now
 

163
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,780
amplified I will try to record that now
and include an episode so hopefully

164
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:02,790
and include an episode so hopefully
 

165
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,960
and include an episode so hopefully
hopefully I can show you rates now so

166
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:05,970
hopefully I can show you rates now so
 

167
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,849
hopefully I can show you rates now so
here it is okay so this isn't normally

168
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:10,859
here it is okay so this isn't normally

about to change my world into amplified
 

175
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,569
about to change my world into amplified
and to do that I have made a backup of

176
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:20,579
and to do that I have made a backup of
 

177

we see all these different data entries
 

199
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,870
we see all these different data entries
the one I'm going to change is a

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:55,880
the one I'm going to change is a
 

201
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,909
the one I'm going to change is a
generator name I believe is the one I'm

202
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:58,919
generator name I believe is the one I'm
 

203
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,520
generator name I believe is the one I'm
looking for right now it's default you

looking for right now it's default you
 

205
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,230
looking for right now it's default you
can change it to super flat to large

206
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,240
can change it to super flat to large
 

207
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,310
can change it to super flat to large
biomes and I'm gonna change it to

208
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
biomes and I'm gonna change it to
 

209
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,150
biomes and I'm gonna change it to
amplified so how do we edit this I've

210
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,160
amplified so how do we edit this I've
 

211
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,710
amplified so how do we edit this I've
never used this program before but how

212
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
never used this program before but how
 

213
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,340
never used this program before but how
hard can it be

214
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,350
hard can it be
 

215
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,920
hard can it be
edit it take that you there we go oh oh

216
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:15,930
edit it take that you there we go oh oh
 

217
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,000

let's drag this over edit string so it's

218
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,010
let's drag this over edit string so it's
 

219
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,180
let's drag this over edit string so it's
a string data entry and I'm going to

220
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,190
a string data entry and I'm going to
 

221
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,710
a string data entry and I'm going to
enter amplified which is oops one of the

222
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:27,720
enter amplified which is oops one of the
 

223
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,370
enter amplified which is oops one of the
settings amplified hopefully this all

224
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,380
settings amplified hopefully this all
 

225
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,029
settings amplified hopefully this all
works okay generator name amplified save

226
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
works okay generator name amplified save
 

227
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,420
works okay generator name amplified save
its save all modified tags and we're

228
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,430
its save all modified tags and we're
 

229
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,779
its save all modified tags and we're
done so let's head back over to my LP LP

230
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:41,789
done so let's head back over to my LP LP
 

231
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,029
done so let's head back over to my LP LP
world and here we are for some reason

232
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,039
world and here we are for some reason
 

233
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,770
world and here we are for some reason
the last three seconds of that clip got

234
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:45,780
the last three seconds of that clip got
 

235
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,020
the last three seconds of that clip got
cut off yeah so hopefully this works I

236
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,030
cut off yeah so hopefully this works I
 

237
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,370
cut off yeah so hopefully this works I
tried to find a guide on how to do this

238
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,380
tried to find a guide on how to do this
 

239
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,950
tried to find a guide on how to do this
and was unable to locate one through

240
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
and was unable to locate one through
 

241
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,390
and was unable to locate one through
Google so this is all me hopefully I

242
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
Google so this is all me hopefully I
 

243
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,950
Google so this is all me hopefully I
know what I'm doing

know what I'm doing
should work I think you would think you

246
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,250
should work I think you would think you
 

247
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,680
should work I think you would think you
think there'd be tons of guys on how to

248
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:06,690
think there'd be tons of guys on how to
 

249
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:14,300
think there'd be tons of guys on how to
do this but come on amplified we're in a

250
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,310
do this but come on amplified we're in a
 

251
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,420
do this but come on amplified we're in a
cave darn it

252
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,430
cave darn it
 

253
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,740
cave darn it

261
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,980
all I see is taiga ah man okay so this
isn't quite the amazing view of

262
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:36,990
isn't quite the amazing view of
 

263
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,230
isn't quite the amazing view of
amplified eyes hoping for when we when

264
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,240
amplified eyes hoping for when we when
 

265
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,070
amplified eyes hoping for when we when
we got out of there

266
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
we got out of there
 

267
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,060

tell you what now I'm entering a speech

268
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,070
tell you what now I'm entering a speech
 

269
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,310
tell you what now I'm entering a speech
you dig straight up and just

270
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,320
you dig straight up and just
 

271
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,250
you dig straight up and just
double-check make sure that works if not

272
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,260
double-check make sure that works if not
 

273
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,710
double-check make sure that works if not
I will maybe load it back up and try

274
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
I will maybe load it back up and try
 

275
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,580
I will maybe load it back up and try
something else

276
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,590
something else
 

277
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,360
something else
I think I saw a tag for world type too

278
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,370
I think I saw a tag for world type too
 

279
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,890
I think I saw a tag for world type too
so I hope I got the right one there I

280
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:01,900
so I hope I got the right one there I
 

281
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,170
so I hope I got the right one there I
looked I looked on the wiki like under

282
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,180
looked I looked on the wiki like under
 

283
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,460
looked I looked on the wiki like under
the development guide there like the

284
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,470
the development guide there like the
 

285
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,080
the development guide there like the
structure of the leveled on that file

286
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,090
structure of the leveled on that file
 

287
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,670
structure of the leveled on that file
and I'm pretty sure that's the tag I

288
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,680
and I'm pretty sure that's the tag I
 

289
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,300
and I'm pretty sure that's the tag I
needed to change holy smokes

290
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,310
needed to change holy smokes
 

291
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,160
needed to change holy smokes
so if there's an amplified world I might

292
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,170
so if there's an amplified world I might
 

293
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,560
so if there's an amplified world I might
have to dig up a couple hundred bucks to

294
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,570
have to dig up a couple hundred bucks to
 

295
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,810
have to dig up a couple hundred bucks to
get out of here in which case I should

296
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:28,820
get out of here in which case I should
 

297
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,760
get out of here in which case I should
probably stop recording okay I'll be

298
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:30,770
probably stop recording okay I'll be
 

299
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,800
probably stop recording okay I'll be
right back okay we're about y8e here and

300
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:35,810
right back okay we're about y8e here and
 

301
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,630
right back okay we're about y8e here and
I've reached the surface so this is it

302
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:37,640
I've reached the surface so this is it
 

303
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,250
I've reached the surface so this is it
is it an amplified world is it's an

304
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:42,260
is it an amplified world is it's an
 

305
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,480
is it an amplified world is it's an
amplified world

306
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,490
amplified world
 

307
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,130
amplified world
let's wait we're definitely on a

308
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,140
let's wait we're definitely on a
 

309
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,970
let's wait we're definitely on a
mountain it regardless

310
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:47,980
mountain it regardless
 

311
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,920
mountain it regardless
no that's looking pretty sweet

312
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:50,930
no that's looking pretty sweet
 

313
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,810
no that's looking pretty sweet
I think it's an amplified world ohm and

314
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:55,820
I think it's an amplified world ohm and
 

315
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,420
I think it's an amplified world ohm and
and this is why I changed cuz even a

316
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:58,430
and this is why I changed cuz even a
 

317
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,730
and this is why I changed cuz even a
taiga biome looks amazing ah yes this is

I mean if your computer can handle it

344
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,330
I mean if your computer can handle it
 

345
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,960
I mean if your computer can handle it
why would you not do this this is how

346
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:49,970
why would you not do this this is how
 

347
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,850
why would you not do this this is how
every world in Minecraft should be I

348

some people have computers that can't
 

355
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,170
some people have computers that can't
handle this kind of stuff so it would be

356
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,180
handle this kind of stuff so it would be
 

357
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,640
handle this kind of stuff so it would be
a little problematic I think but if it

358
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:06,650
a little problematic I think but if it
 

359

a little problematic I think but if it
works in my single-player I definitely

360
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,510
works in my single-player I definitely
 

361

that change yet oh so those big leg
spikes are from the generation for sure

436
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:01,960
spikes are from the generation for sure
 

437
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,540
spikes are from the generation for sure
okay and there's still gonna be flat

well another big leg spike from the
 

447
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,100
well another big leg spike from the
generation not too bad

448
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,110

you guys think next time we'll do a
 

1195
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,220
you guys think next time we'll do a
little more exploring then we'll

1196
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,230
little more exploring then we'll
 

1197
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,590
little more exploring then we'll
probably head back and oh yeah this is

1198
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:56,600
probably head back and oh yeah this is
 

1199
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,610
probably head back and oh yeah this is
hopefully I don't have any trouble with

1200
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:58,620
hopefully I don't have any trouble with
 

1201
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,820
hopefully I don't have any trouble with
this but I just realized when I speak in

1202
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:01,830
this but I just realized when I speak in
 

1203
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,090
this but I just realized when I speak in
the comment here that apparently I've

1204
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,100
the comment here that apparently I've
 

1205
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,789
the comment here that apparently I've
had another instance of Minecraft open

1206
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:07,799
had another instance of Minecraft open
 

1207
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,460
had another instance of Minecraft open
this whole time and it was me in my LP

1208
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:10,470
this whole time and it was me in my LP
 

1209
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,840
this whole time and it was me in my LP
world so if you don't know this you can

1210
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:11,850
world so if you don't know this you can
 

1211
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,390
world so if you don't know this you can
join like a single-player world more

1212
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:14,400
join like a single-player world more
 

1213
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,940
join like a single-player world more
than more than once so you can have your

1214
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:16,950
than more than once so you can have your
 

1215
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,510
than more than once so you can have your
same guy like in in the nether and one

1216
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:20,520
same guy like in in the nether and one
 

1217
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,970
same guy like in in the nether and one
in the overworld and and even have them

1218
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:22,980
in the overworld and and even have them
 

1219
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,990
in the overworld and and even have them
together and that can cause the game to

1220
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,000
together and that can cause the game to
 

1221
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,539
together and that can cause the game to
crash and I've had that happen and I've

1222
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:29,549
crash and I've had that happen and I've
 

1223
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,030
crash and I've had that happen and I've
lost a lot of what I've done so

1224
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,040
lost a lot of what I've done so
 

1225
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,590
lost a lot of what I've done so
hopefully what I've explored and all

1226
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600
hopefully what I've explored and all
 

1227
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,560
hopefully what I've explored and all
this doesn't go away when I want to end

1228
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,570
this doesn't go away when I want to end
 

1229
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,299
this doesn't go away when I want to end
it here today but I think it's okay it

1230
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:38,309
it here today but I think it's okay it
 

1231
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,700
it here today but I think it's okay it
hasn't crashed yet and I've done a lot

1232
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:39,710
hasn't crashed yet and I've done a lot
 

1233
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,920
hasn't crashed yet and I've done a lot
so be careful

1234
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:42,930
so be careful
 

1235
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,050
so be careful
be careful you don't open the same world

1236
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,060
be careful you don't open the same world
 

1237
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,150
be careful you don't open the same world
twice and have two instances going

1238
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,160
twice and have two instances going
 

1239
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,860
twice and have two instances going
because it's not really made to handle

1240
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:48,870
because it's not really made to handle
 

1241
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,960
because it's not really made to handle
that I think there used to be a

1242
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:50,970
that I think there used to be a
 

1243
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,110
that I think there used to be a
protection to stop that from happening

1244
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
protection to stop that from happening
 

1245
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,270
protection to stop that from happening
but yeah it's definitely weird anyway

1246
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,280
but yeah it's definitely weird anyway
 

1247
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,130
but yeah it's definitely weird anyway
