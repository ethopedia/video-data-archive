then we'll be able to punch them or
 

167
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,219
then we'll be able to punch them or
something - to do the final blow on them

168
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:04,229
something - to do the final blow on them
 

169
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,570
something - to do the final blow on them
is the plan so I'm going to get started

170
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:08,580
is the plan so I'm going to get started
 

171
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,390
is the plan so I'm going to get started
building here and use stone bricks and

172
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,400
building here and use stone bricks and
 

173
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,870
building here and use stone bricks and
glass and I did definitely did not bring

174
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
glass and I did definitely did not bring
 

175
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,210
glass and I did definitely did not bring
enough blocks with me but we'll we'll

176
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,220
enough blocks with me but we'll we'll
 

177
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,850
enough blocks with me but we'll we'll
see what we can do here so I'm gonna

178
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:20,860

 

179
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,299

highlight the frame around it and when

180
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:28,309
highlight the frame around it and when
 

181
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,219
highlight the frame around it and when
this is all done I'll be removing this

182
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:30,229
this is all done I'll be removing this
 

183
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,519
this is all done I'll be removing this
netherrack all around this area here but

184
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,529
netherrack all around this area here but
 

185
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,429
netherrack all around this area here but
just for now I'm going to leave it in

186
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:38,439

 

187
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,549

okay go and maybe I'll go in one more

188
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:45,559
okay go and maybe I'll go in one more
 

189
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,269
okay go and maybe I'll go in one more
block yet and then I'm going to use

190
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:49,279
block yet and then I'm going to use
 

191
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,249
block yet and then I'm going to use
glass just so we can see what's going on

192
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:51,259
glass just so we can see what's going on
 

193
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,259
glass just so we can see what's going on
inside this is going to be the central

194
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:55,269

 

195
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,389

centerpiece of our nether base that's

196
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:58,399
centerpiece of our nether base that's
 

197
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,229
centerpiece of our nether base that's
what we're going to be looking at yeah

198
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:02,239
what we're going to be looking at yeah
 

199
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:08,649
what we're going to be looking at yeah
definitely never enough blocks okay oh I

200
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:08,659
definitely never enough blocks okay oh I
 

201
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,519
definitely never enough blocks okay oh I
went too thick year so nice these things

202
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:12,529
went too thick year so nice these things
 

203
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,029
went too thick year so nice these things
break quicker now

204
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
break quicker now
 

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,529
break quicker now
okay so two blocks thick and then I'm

206
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:17,539
okay so two blocks thick and then I'm
 

207
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,889
okay so two blocks thick and then I'm
going to put glass on top on the sides

208
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:22,899
going to put glass on top on the sides
 

209
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,779
going to put glass on top on the sides
and hopefully that looks pretty decently

210
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:25,789
and hopefully that looks pretty decently
 

211
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:33,969
and hopefully that looks pretty decently
afterward okay and the so we're going to

212
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:33,979
afterward okay and the so we're going to
 

213
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,449
afterward okay and the so we're going to
move the blaze around using pistons and

214
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:37,459
move the blaze around using pistons and
 

215
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,999
move the blaze around using pistons and
I have played around with this before in

216
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:40,009
I have played around with this before in
 

217
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,409
I have played around with this before in
the past and creative mode which is a

218
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:43,419
the past and creative mode which is a
 

219
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,729
the past and creative mode which is a
really good thing actually because it

220
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:45,739
really good thing actually because it
 

221
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:49,869
really good thing actually because it
would be so difficult trying to tweak

222
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:49,879
would be so difficult trying to tweak
 

223
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,739
would be so difficult trying to tweak
this thing playing in a legit world and

224
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:53,749
this thing playing in a legit world and
 

225
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:57,909
this thing playing in a legit world and
trying to figure it out so I'm glad I

226
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
trying to figure it out so I'm glad I
 

227
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,979
trying to figure it out so I'm glad I
have the experience so then this will

228
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:02,989
have the experience so then this will
 

229
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:05,739
have the experience so then this will
come down we have to leave that one

230
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:05,749
come down we have to leave that one
 

231
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:12,040
come down we have to leave that one
block airspace above there so that see

232
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,050
block airspace above there so that see
 

233
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,749
block airspace above there so that see
I'm going to leave this one air block

234
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
I'm going to leave this one air block
 

235
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,369
I'm going to leave this one air block
space so that they'll be able to spawn

236
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:15,379
space so that they'll be able to spawn
 

237
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:23,049
space so that they'll be able to spawn
at this level here and put the frame

238
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:23,059
at this level here and put the frame
 

239
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,299
at this level here and put the frame
down usually when I build stuff in my LP

240
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:25,309
down usually when I build stuff in my LP
 

241
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,310
down usually when I build stuff in my LP
world I do it

242
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,320
world I do it
 

243
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,950
world I do it
for the first time in the lp world I

244
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:29,960
for the first time in the lp world I
 

245
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,720
for the first time in the lp world I
don't pre build it and then rebuild it

246
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:31,730
don't pre build it and then rebuild it
 

247
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,270
don't pre build it and then rebuild it
in my LP because that would take a lot

248
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,280
in my LP because that would take a lot
 

249
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,969
in my LP because that would take a lot
of the fun out of it for me but this is

250
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979
of the fun out of it for me but this is
 

251
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,420
of the fun out of it for me but this is
an exception I haven't fully built it in

252
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,430
an exception I haven't fully built it in
 

253
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,060
an exception I haven't fully built it in
creative mode but I I have played around

254
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,070
creative mode but I I have played around
 

255
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,580
creative mode but I I have played around
with ideas so I have it pretty well in

256
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,590
with ideas so I have it pretty well in
 

257
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,920
with ideas so I have it pretty well in
mind how I want to do it it's kind of

258
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:50,930
mind how I want to do it it's kind of
 

259
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,810
mind how I want to do it it's kind of
going to be like a giant ice cream cone

260
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:57,820

 

261
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,550

okay so maybe I'll do a little more

262
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
okay so maybe I'll do a little more
 

263
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,870
okay so maybe I'll do a little more
off-camera here and then we'll get back

264
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:01,880
off-camera here and then we'll get back
 

265
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,550
off-camera here and then we'll get back
to it all right so I did a supply run

266
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
to it all right so I did a supply run
 

267
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,550
to it all right so I did a supply run
brought some goodies over here made a

268
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:09,560
brought some goodies over here made a
 

269
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,960
brought some goodies over here made a
bunch of pistons - got more glass I've

270
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:13,970
bunch of pistons - got more glass I've
 

271
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,750
bunch of pistons - got more glass I've
been working on it I'm pretty sure I

272
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:16,760
been working on it I'm pretty sure I
 

273
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,640
been working on it I'm pretty sure I
don't know I think I'm going to have to

274
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:18,650
don't know I think I'm going to have to
 

275
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,770
don't know I think I'm going to have to
make the border one thick and replace

276
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:20,780
make the border one thick and replace
 

277
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,130
make the border one thick and replace
some of these stone bricks with glass in

278
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,140
some of these stone bricks with glass in
 

279
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,930
some of these stone bricks with glass in
the end just to make it look better I'm

280
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:25,940
the end just to make it look better I'm
 

281
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,660
the end just to make it look better I'm
not sure we won't be able to tell until

282
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:28,670
not sure we won't be able to tell until
 

283
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,760
not sure we won't be able to tell until
we remove all this nether brick around

284
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:30,770
we remove all this nether brick around
 

285
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,840
we remove all this nether brick around
it oops

286
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:31,850
it oops
 

287
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,240
it oops
and then we'll be able to see from the

288
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,250
and then we'll be able to see from the
 

289
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,640
and then we'll be able to see from the
distance how how good or how bad it

290
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:36,650
distance how how good or how bad it
 

291
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,090
distance how how good or how bad it
looks but we'll worry about that later

292
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,100
looks but we'll worry about that later
 

293
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,530
looks but we'll worry about that later
so yeah I've been extending this glass

294
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:44,540
so yeah I've been extending this glass
 

295
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:51,670
so yeah I've been extending this glass
down like this and we're about to start

296
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
down like this and we're about to start
 

297
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,260
down like this and we're about to start
the ice for the cone part of it and I'll

298
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,270
the ice for the cone part of it and I'll
 

299
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,230
the ice for the cone part of it and I'll
probably link to people in the

300
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,240
probably link to people in the
 

301
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,730
probably link to people in the
description of this video because

302
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:02,740
description of this video because
 

303
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,870
description of this video because
they've done a lot of work on blaze

304
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
they've done a lot of work on blaze
 

305
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
they've done a lot of work on blaze
firms I did a search and that they seem

306
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,610
firms I did a search and that they seem
 

307
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,300
firms I did a search and that they seem
to be two of the big guys working on it

308
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,310
to be two of the big guys working on it
 

309
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,990
to be two of the big guys working on it
and one of the guys actually made a cone

310
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
and one of the guys actually made a cone
 

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,720
and one of the guys actually made a cone
style as well which is going to be very

312
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,730
style as well which is going to be very
 

313
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,970
style as well which is going to be very
similar to what I'm building here so and

314
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:21,980
similar to what I'm building here so and
 

315
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:31,120
similar to what I'm building here so and
check them out okay so the very lowest

316
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,130
check them out okay so the very lowest
 

317
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,000
check them out okay so the very lowest
the blaze will spawn is at this level

318
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,010
the blaze will spawn is at this level
 

319
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,350
the blaze will spawn is at this level
here so I'm going to start bringing out

320
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360
here so I'm going to start bringing out
 

321
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,690
here so I'm going to start bringing out
the cone here

322
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:41,700
the cone here
 

323
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,280
the cone here
so they'll be able to spot on top these

324
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,290
so they'll be able to spot on top these
 

325
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,260
so they'll be able to spot on top these
blocks I'm placing right now and just

326
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,270
blocks I'm placing right now and just
 

327
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,450
blocks I'm placing right now and just
leaving a little door here so I can get

328
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,460
leaving a little door here so I can get
 

329
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:02,970
leaving a little door here so I can get
out okay then it will go down and the

330
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:02,980
out okay then it will go down and the
 

331
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,890
out okay then it will go down and the
block will have a two block drop so that

332
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:04,900
block will have a two block drop so that
 

333
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,130
block will have a two block drop so that
the blaze will not be able to get back

334
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,140
the blaze will not be able to get back
 

335
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,500
the blaze will not be able to get back
up up here if it's confusing now don't

336
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,510
up up here if it's confusing now don't
 

337
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,570
up up here if it's confusing now don't
worry I'll make more sense once it's all

338
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:15,580
worry I'll make more sense once it's all
 

339
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,880
worry I'll make more sense once it's all
finished this is a little hard to

340
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:17,890
finished this is a little hard to
 

341
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:28,350
finished this is a little hard to
visualize at the moment okay now go down

342
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,360
visualize at the moment okay now go down
 

343
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,870
visualize at the moment okay now go down
one more layer here and so that is this

344
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
one more layer here and so that is this
 

345
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,070
one more layer here and so that is this
collecting them all to the very center

346
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,080
collecting them all to the very center
 

347
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,790
collecting them all to the very center
going to be careful around this drop so

348
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
going to be careful around this drop so
 

349
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:56,030
going to be careful around this drop so
it'll come in one more block like this

350
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040

 

351
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,390

okay once the blaze fall down to this

352
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,400
okay once the blaze fall down to this
 

353
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,980
okay once the blaze fall down to this
level here I believe I know they'll

354
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:04,990
level here I believe I know they'll
 

355
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,150
level here I believe I know they'll
still be in range they have to fall down

356
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
still be in range they have to fall down
 

357
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,760
still be in range they have to fall down
one more yet sorry I'm not explaining

358
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,770
one more yet sorry I'm not explaining
 

359
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,310
one more yet sorry I'm not explaining
things very well right now

360
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:13,320
things very well right now
 

361
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,140
things very well right now
okay so what I'll do next is we'll have

362
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,150
okay so what I'll do next is we'll have
 

363
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:23,660
okay so what I'll do next is we'll have
pressure plates and Pistons repeaters

364
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:23,670

 

365
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,560

etc I'm going to skip putting pistons on

366
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,570
etc I'm going to skip putting pistons on
 

367
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,600
etc I'm going to skip putting pistons on
this first level here just because I

368
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,610
this first level here just because I
 

369
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,480
this first level here just because I
don't think they're really necessary the

370
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,490
don't think they're really necessary the
 

371
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,160
don't think they're really necessary the
blaze will probably fall down on their

372
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,170
blaze will probably fall down on their
 

373
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,490
blaze will probably fall down on their
own but it wouldn't hurt to add them

374
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:38,500
own but it wouldn't hurt to add them
 

375
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,600
own but it wouldn't hurt to add them
either I'm just I'm just being cheap and

376
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:41,610
either I'm just I'm just being cheap and
 

377
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,600
either I'm just I'm just being cheap and
then we'll have pressure plates here on

378
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,610
then we'll have pressure plates here on
 

379
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:55,910
then we'll have pressure plates here on
all four sides one there and let's see I

380
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
all four sides one there and let's see I
 

381
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,900
all four sides one there and let's see I
just behind here is where no not there

382
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:02,910

 

383
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:18,570

over here where the pistons will go okay

384
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:18,580
over here where the pistons will go okay
 

385
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:28,500
over here where the pistons will go okay
so basically we'll have repeaters next

386
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,510
so basically we'll have repeaters next
 

387
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,940
so basically we'll have repeaters next
to these pressure plates they will go to

388
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:34,950

 

389
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:44,040

the block and then the sticky pistons

390
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,050
the block and then the sticky pistons
 

391
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,850
the block and then the sticky pistons
will go on top of that oops and then

392
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:50,860
will go on top of that oops and then
 

393
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,880
will go on top of that oops and then
we'll have more stone bricks in front of

394
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:53,890
we'll have more stone bricks in front of
 

395
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:59,970
we'll have more stone bricks in front of
them okay so if a blaze is up here and

396
00:13:59,970 --> 00:13:59,980
them okay so if a blaze is up here and
 

397
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,710
them okay so if a blaze is up here and
he wanders down lands on a pressure

398
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:01,720
he wanders down lands on a pressure
 

399
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,110
he wanders down lands on a pressure
plate the block will push him down one

400
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
plate the block will push him down one
 

401
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,090
plate the block will push him down one
more and then when he falls down one

402
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,100
more and then when he falls down one
 

403
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,360
more and then when he falls down one
more same thing will happen until they

404
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,370
more same thing will happen until they
 

405
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:18,290
more same thing will happen until they
all end up in a 2x2 area okay

406
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,300
all end up in a 2x2 area okay
 

407
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,520
all end up in a 2x2 area okay
so I think I'm just going to go ahead

408
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,530
so I think I'm just going to go ahead
 

409
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,080
so I think I'm just going to go ahead
and finish this up and then you'll be

410
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,090
and finish this up and then you'll be
 

411
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,690
and finish this up and then you'll be
able to see it a bit better and I might

412
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:24,700
able to see it a bit better and I might
 

413
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:31,020
able to see it a bit better and I might
add one more piston in the corners okay

414
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,030
add one more piston in the corners okay
 

415
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,180
add one more piston in the corners okay
so the second level here is just about

416
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,190
so the second level here is just about
 

417
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,110
so the second level here is just about
done at so it doesn't matter where the

418
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
done at so it doesn't matter where the
 

419
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,930
done at so it doesn't matter where the
blaze land on the second level they'll

420
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:39,940
blaze land on the second level they'll
 

421
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,400
blaze land on the second level they'll
activate one of these pressure plates

422
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,410
activate one of these pressure plates
 

423
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,160
activate one of these pressure plates
and that will cause the piston push them

424
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,170
and that will cause the piston push them
 

425
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,780
and that will cause the piston push them
down one more level to the center and

426
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:48,790
down one more level to the center and
 

427
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,210
down one more level to the center and
then they'll be I think a three block

428
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:51,220
then they'll be I think a three block
 

429
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,400
then they'll be I think a three block
drop and the land on more pressure

430
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,410
drop and the land on more pressure
 

431
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,740
drop and the land on more pressure
plates and then that will push them to a

432
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:55,750
plates and then that will push them to a
 

433
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:02,940
plates and then that will push them to a
2x2 area so in front of every piston is

434
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:02,950
2x2 area so in front of every piston is
 

435
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,780
2x2 area so in front of every piston is
a block and I just I'm just leaving a

436
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:09,790
a block and I just I'm just leaving a
 

437
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,740
a block and I just I'm just leaving a
doorway there for now and then there's a

438
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:13,750
doorway there for now and then there's a
 

439
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:23,190
doorway there for now and then there's a
repeater for each one as well so that's

440
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,200
repeater for each one as well so that's
 

441
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,160
repeater for each one as well so that's
all there is to it for these corner ones

442
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,170
all there is to it for these corner ones
 

443
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,930
all there is to it for these corner ones
I hope this works they should get pushed

444
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:30,940
I hope this works they should get pushed
 

445
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,990
I hope this works they should get pushed
into into this pressure plate here that

446
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
into into this pressure plate here that
 

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,240
into into this pressure plate here that
that will push them off it's important

448
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,250
that will push them off it's important
 

449
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,930
that will push them off it's important
to use these sticky pistons instead of a

450
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:41,940
to use these sticky pistons instead of a
 

451
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,250
to use these sticky pistons instead of a
like with a block on them instead of

452
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,260
like with a block on them instead of
 

453
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,640
like with a block on them instead of
just a regular piston because sometimes

454
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:47,650
just a regular piston because sometimes
 

455
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,470
just a regular piston because sometimes
the regular pistons glitch out with mobs

456
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,480
the regular pistons glitch out with mobs
 

457
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,750
the regular pistons glitch out with mobs
and it won't push them so the the mob

458
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:54,760
and it won't push them so the the mob
 

459
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,120
and it won't push them so the the mob
will still be on the pressure plate with

460
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,130
will still be on the pressure plate with
 

461
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,630
will still be on the pressure plate with
the piston inside of them and they will

462
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:00,640
the piston inside of them and they will
 

463
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,220
the piston inside of them and they will
never move away from that area so

464
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,230
never move away from that area so
 

465
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,040
never move away from that area so
they'll get stuck but if there's a block

466
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,050
they'll get stuck but if there's a block
 

467
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,960
they'll get stuck but if there's a block
and that happens they'll suffocate so

468
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:09,970
and that happens they'll suffocate so
 

469
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,430
and that happens they'll suffocate so
that's important so just don't use

470
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,440
that's important so just don't use
 

471
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,490
that's important so just don't use
regular pistons so what I'm saying okay

472
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,500
regular pistons so what I'm saying okay
 

473
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,910
regular pistons so what I'm saying okay
so that's one level done and when this

474
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
so that's one level done and when this
 

475
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,400
so that's one level done and when this
is all done I'll remove the cobblestone

476
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,410
is all done I'll remove the cobblestone
 

477
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,569
is all done I'll remove the cobblestone
as safely as I can I'm going to start

478
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:30,579
as safely as I can I'm going to start
 

479
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:35,249
as safely as I can I'm going to start
working on the next level down here okay

480
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:35,259
working on the next level down here okay
 

481
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,689
working on the next level down here okay
so the third level is finished now

482
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:36,699
so the third level is finished now
 

483
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,199
so the third level is finished now
there's 12 pressure plates Pistons

484
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:40,209
there's 12 pressure plates Pistons
 

485
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,319
there's 12 pressure plates Pistons
repeaters on it this level here has 20

486
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:43,329
repeaters on it this level here has 20
 

487
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:46,199
repeaters on it this level here has 20
if we were to do them on this top level

488
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:46,209
if we were to do them on this top level
 

489
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,720
if we were to do them on this top level
there would be another 28 which is

490
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,730
there would be another 28 which is
 

491
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,290
there would be another 28 which is
pretty expensive 28 pistons 28 repeaters

492
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,300
pretty expensive 28 pistons 28 repeaters
 

493
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,600
pretty expensive 28 pistons 28 repeaters
that's why I'm skipping it it as long as

494
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:57,610
that's why I'm skipping it it as long as
 

495
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,759
that's why I'm skipping it it as long as
there's not six blades up here at a time

496
00:16:59,759 --> 00:16:59,769
there's not six blades up here at a time
 

497
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,490
there's not six blades up here at a time
it shouldn't matter much because they'll

498
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:02,500
it shouldn't matter much because they'll
 

499
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,929
it shouldn't matter much because they'll
wander off and then they'll get sent

500
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:03,939
wander off and then they'll get sent
 

501
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,610
wander off and then they'll get sent
down here and they'll be far enough away

502
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:05,620
down here and they'll be far enough away
 

503
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,610
down here and they'll be far enough away
from the spawner that they won't affect

504
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,620
from the spawner that they won't affect
 

505
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,130
from the spawner that they won't affect
the spawning rates we'll see how it

506
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,140
the spawning rates we'll see how it
 

507
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,409
the spawning rates we'll see how it
works once it's all done here and it's

508
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:16,419
works once it's all done here and it's
 

509
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:22,860
works once it's all done here and it's
red pigment dye okay so there is one

510
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:22,870
red pigment dye okay so there is one
 

511
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,679
red pigment dye okay so there is one
issue here though I'm having these

512
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:25,689
issue here though I'm having these
 

513
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,710
issue here though I'm having these
pressure plates are affecting the

514
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
pressure plates are affecting the
 

515
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,940
pressure plates are affecting the
Pistons below as well as the ones above

516
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:34,950
Pistons below as well as the ones above
 

517
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,820
Pistons below as well as the ones above
isn't it no way it's not a huge issue

518
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:38,830
isn't it no way it's not a huge issue
 

519
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,630
isn't it no way it's not a huge issue
because as soon as we get pushed off of

520
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
because as soon as we get pushed off of
 

521
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,820
because as soon as we get pushed off of
them it will retract within a second

522
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:44,830
them it will retract within a second
 

523
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,130
them it will retract within a second
anyway but yeah a little bit will stand

524
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,140
anyway but yeah a little bit will stand
 

525
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,440
anyway but yeah a little bit will stand
on a block for a second or half a second

526
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,450
on a block for a second or half a second
 

527
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,070
on a block for a second or half a second
there before it gets retracted should be

528
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
there before it gets retracted should be
 

529
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,210
there before it gets retracted should be
okay it's just due to that piston glitch

530
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,220
okay it's just due to that piston glitch
 

531
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,270
okay it's just due to that piston glitch
or whatever that makes the piston bud

532
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
or whatever that makes the piston bud
 

533
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
or whatever that makes the piston bud
switch is possible like even if I remove

534
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,450
switch is possible like even if I remove
 

535
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,740
switch is possible like even if I remove
this repeater stays extended but if I go

536
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:10,750
this repeater stays extended but if I go
 

537
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,399
this repeater stays extended but if I go
off it retracts but now if I walk on it

538
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,409
off it retracts but now if I walk on it
 

539
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:17,940
off it retracts but now if I walk on it
it doesn't extend unless a block updates

540
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:17,950
it doesn't extend unless a block updates
 

541
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:27,450
it doesn't extend unless a block updates
near the piston okay so that is that we

542
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:27,460
near the piston okay so that is that we
 

543
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,090
near the piston okay so that is that we
will set up our crusher down here a

544
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,100
will set up our crusher down here a
 

545
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,100
will set up our crusher down here a
little viewing area and so I got to

546
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,110
little viewing area and so I got to
 

547
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,110
little viewing area and so I got to
connect the fortress to down here

548
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
connect the fortress to down here
 

549
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
connect the fortress to down here
somehow so I'll be doing a little bit of

550
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,370
somehow so I'll be doing a little bit of
 

551
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,930
somehow so I'll be doing a little bit of
tunneling so instead of our base being

552
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:44,940
tunneling so instead of our base being
 

553
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,409
tunneling so instead of our base being
oops instead of our base being up at

554
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:49,419
oops instead of our base being up at
 

555
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,389
oops instead of our base being up at
this level here we're going to be down

556
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:51,399
this level here we're going to be down
 

557
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:57,690
this level here we're going to be down
down there will be our main level for

558
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:57,700
down there will be our main level for
 

559
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,240
down there will be our main level for
right now I have a path down to the

560
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,250
right now I have a path down to the
 

561
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,100
right now I have a path down to the
crusher area here this is where it will

562
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,110
crusher area here this is where it will
 

563
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,909
crusher area here this is where it will
happen the drop is four blocks down so

564
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:08,919
happen the drop is four blocks down so
 

565
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,159
happen the drop is four blocks down so
one two three four and I don't know

566
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:14,169
one two three four and I don't know
 

567
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,810
one two three four and I don't know
exactly how I'm going to wire this yet

568
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:15,820
exactly how I'm going to wire this yet
 

569
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,310
exactly how I'm going to wire this yet
and we probably won't be able to do that

570
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,320
and we probably won't be able to do that
 

571
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,279
and we probably won't be able to do that
this episode but I'll tell you what I

572
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:20,289
this episode but I'll tell you what I
 

573
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,730
this episode but I'll tell you what I
want what I want to happen with this

574
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:23,740
want what I want to happen with this
 

575
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,980
want what I want to happen with this
wiring I'm going to have I think Pistons

576
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:28,990
wiring I'm going to have I think Pistons
 

577
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:35,430
wiring I'm going to have I think Pistons
here no not there you can have Pistons

578
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
here no not there you can have Pistons
 

579
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,450
here no not there you can have Pistons
at the back there and in over here

580
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,460
at the back there and in over here
 

581
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,620
at the back there and in over here
facing the right way

582
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,630

 

583
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,550

be careful there's gas out there okay so

584
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,560
be careful there's gas out there okay so
 

585
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,520
be careful there's gas out there okay so
these will have blocks on them and then

586
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:57,530
these will have blocks on them and then
 

587
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,340
these will have blocks on them and then
below that we'll have another group of

588
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,350
below that we'll have another group of
 

589
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,670
below that we'll have another group of
pistons in the same position maybe maybe

590
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:03,680
pistons in the same position maybe maybe
 

591
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,070
pistons in the same position maybe maybe
I'm not sure yet oh he just felt saw me

592
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm not sure yet oh he just felt saw me
 

593
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,840
I'm not sure yet oh he just felt saw me
like that okay so that that's how the

594
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:13,850
like that okay so that that's how the
 

595
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,900
like that okay so that that's how the
Pistons might be and then this will be

596
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:19,910
Pistons might be and then this will be
 

597
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,970
Pistons might be and then this will be
closed off too and they'll be glass in

598
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:24,980
closed off too and they'll be glass in
 

599
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,480
closed off too and they'll be glass in
front here so the blaze can escape and

600
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,490
front here so the blaze can escape and
 

601
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,600
front here so the blaze can escape and
then I think I'll have two buttons oops

602
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,610
then I think I'll have two buttons oops
 

603
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,920
then I think I'll have two buttons oops
when I press the first one all these

604
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:35,930
when I press the first one all these
 

605
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,520
when I press the first one all these
blocks will close in that will cause a

606
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,530
blocks will close in that will cause a
 

607
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,980
blocks will close in that will cause a
suffocating to happen the button will

608
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:41,990
suffocating to happen the button will
 

609
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,240
suffocating to happen the button will
have to be hooked up to a pulse extender

610
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,250
have to be hooked up to a pulse extender
 

611
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,430
have to be hooked up to a pulse extender
so that the pulse takes eight or nine

612
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,440
so that the pulse takes eight or nine
 

613
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,400
so that the pulse takes eight or nine
seconds or whatever it is to suffocate

614
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,410
seconds or whatever it is to suffocate
 

615
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,770
seconds or whatever it is to suffocate
the mob's just to the point where

616
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:53,780
the mob's just to the point where
 

617
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,080
the mob's just to the point where
they're they have like half a heart

618
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,090
they're they have like half a heart
 

619
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,870
they're they have like half a heart
health left ideally without killing them

620
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
health left ideally without killing them
 

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,450
health left ideally without killing them
then after that time passes

622
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:04,460
then after that time passes
 

623
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,990
then after that time passes
this bottom these bottom four Pistons

624
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
this bottom these bottom four Pistons
 

625
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,910
this bottom these bottom four Pistons
need to retract again but these top ones

626
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:12,920
need to retract again but these top ones
 

627
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,950
need to retract again but these top ones
will stay closed so it'll look like this

628
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
will stay closed so it'll look like this
 

629
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,450
will stay closed so it'll look like this
basically and then I'll be able to punch

630
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:19,460
basically and then I'll be able to punch
 

631
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,590
basically and then I'll be able to punch
the blaze and then when I hit the final

632
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
the blaze and then when I hit the final
 

633
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,100
the blaze and then when I hit the final
the second button here these tapas tins

634
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,110
the second button here these tapas tins
 

635
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,860
the second button here these tapas tins
will open again and let the blaze down

636
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,870
will open again and let the blaze down
 

637
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,740
will open again and let the blaze down
and that's just so they don't get mixed

638
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:32,750
and that's just so they don't get mixed
 

639
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,740
and that's just so they don't get mixed
together where some are suffocate and

640
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:35,750
together where some are suffocate and
 

641
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,730
together where some are suffocate and
then some aren't I need a shutoff for

642
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:39,740
then some aren't I need a shutoff for
 

643
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,360
then some aren't I need a shutoff for
the thing and ideally I want these back

644
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,370
the thing and ideally I want these back
 

645
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,690
the thing and ideally I want these back
two Pistons to extend first and then the

646
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:46,700
two Pistons to extend first and then the
 

647
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,870
two Pistons to extend first and then the
two side ones and that will bring the

648
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:49,880
two side ones and that will bring the
 

649
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,890
two side ones and that will bring the
blaze up to these front two blocks where

650
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:53,900
blaze up to these front two blocks where
 

651
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,380
blaze up to these front two blocks where
they'll get crushed in that way their

652
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,390
they'll get crushed in that way their
 

653
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,020
they'll get crushed in that way their
drops will be within range where I can

654
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,030
drops will be within range where I can
 

655
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,740
drops will be within range where I can
pick them up

656
00:21:59,740 --> 00:21:59,750
pick them up
 

657
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,710
pick them up
easily instead of like landing in the

658
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
easily instead of like landing in the
 

659
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,340
easily instead of like landing in the
back here where I can't reach them

660
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,350
back here where I can't reach them
 

661
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,110
back here where I can't reach them
that's kind of the plan I might mess

662
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,120
that's kind of the plan I might mess
 

663
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,850
that's kind of the plan I might mess
around with this a bit yet I don't know

664
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:09,860
around with this a bit yet I don't know
 

665
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,960
around with this a bit yet I don't know
we'll see yeah it's kind of expecting

666
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:13,970
we'll see yeah it's kind of expecting
 

667
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,000
we'll see yeah it's kind of expecting
this but the Pistons won't work how I

668
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,010
this but the Pistons won't work how I
 

669
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:21,840
this but the Pistons won't work how I
have them positioned here I tried it out

670
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:21,850

 

671
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,020

so that extends the top one extends the

672
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,030
so that extends the top one extends the
 

673
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,440
so that extends the top one extends the
bottom one but the problem is you won't

674
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,450
bottom one but the problem is you won't
 

675
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,990
bottom one but the problem is you won't
be able to retract this bottom one

676
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,000
be able to retract this bottom one
 

677
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,390
be able to retract this bottom one
because the top ones being powered due

678
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
because the top ones being powered due
 

679
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,160
because the top ones being powered due
to that piston glitch so that won't work

680
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,170

 

681
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,390

because this is the one we need to

682
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:43,400
because this is the one we need to
 

683
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,270
because this is the one we need to
retract so that they won't suffocate to

684
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,280
retract so that they won't suffocate to
 

685
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,660
retract so that they won't suffocate to
the point of dying and the top one is

686
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:49,670
the point of dying and the top one is
 

687
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,450
the point of dying and the top one is
what keeps them from coming down but I

688
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:52,460
what keeps them from coming down but I
 

689
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,220
what keeps them from coming down but I
should be able to fix that just by

690
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,230
should be able to fix that just by
 

691
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,260
should be able to fix that just by
offsetting the Pistons from each other

692
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,270
offsetting the Pistons from each other
 

693
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,260
offsetting the Pistons from each other
so they can't be directly on top or

694
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,270
so they can't be directly on top or
 

695
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,570
so they can't be directly on top or
below each other so I could maybe put

696
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:06,580
below each other so I could maybe put
 

697
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,670
below each other so I could maybe put
the top two over here instead of at the

698
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:09,680
the top two over here instead of at the
 

699
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,890
the top two over here instead of at the
back wall and then instead of having one

700
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:14,900
back wall and then instead of having one
 

701
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,640
back wall and then instead of having one
here I could maybe put it over here and

702
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:17,650
here I could maybe put it over here and
 

703
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,440
here I could maybe put it over here and
see how that works out yeah so this

704
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,450
see how that works out yeah so this
 

705
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,800
see how that works out yeah so this
seems to work okay so if I power the top

706
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:26,810
seems to work okay so if I power the top
 

707
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,180
seems to work okay so if I power the top
one it extends bottom one can extend and

708
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,190
one it extends bottom one can extend and
 

709
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,000
one it extends bottom one can extend and
I'm able to retract the bottom one which

710
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,010
I'm able to retract the bottom one which
 

711
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,909
I'm able to retract the bottom one which
is what I need

712
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
is what I need
 

713
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,270
is what I need
so they're independent now they're not

714
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
so they're independent now they're not
 

715
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,610
so they're independent now they're not
affecting each other and I can either

716
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:42,620
affecting each other and I can either
 

717
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,250
affecting each other and I can either
put the power into this block or this

718
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,260
put the power into this block or this
 

719
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,510
put the power into this block or this
one this block or this one it's

720
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
one this block or this one it's
 

721
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,250
one this block or this one it's
invisible block right here uh-huh

722
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:54,260
invisible block right here uh-huh
 

723
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,090
invisible block right here uh-huh
and then other front Pistons will be

724
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,100
and then other front Pistons will be
 

725
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,630
and then other front Pistons will be
here I'm thinking I will use glass for

726
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:01,640
here I'm thinking I will use glass for
 

727
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,330
here I'm thinking I will use glass for
this for these top ones just so that

728
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,340
this for these top ones just so that
 

729
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:12,909
this for these top ones just so that
we'll be able to see the mobs above so

730
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:12,919
we'll be able to see the mobs above so
 

731
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:24,760
we'll be able to see the mobs above so
to look like that'll extend and get two

732
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:24,770
to look like that'll extend and get two
 

733
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:31,450
to look like that'll extend and get two
more levers here so I should be able to

734
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:31,460
more levers here so I should be able to
 

735
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,220
more levers here so I should be able to
power these ones on the side here you

736
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,230
power these ones on the side here you
 

737
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,310
power these ones on the side here you
won't be able to see the wiring that way

738
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,320
won't be able to see the wiring that way
 

739
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,630
won't be able to see the wiring that way
she'll be okay and yeah I think that'll

740
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
she'll be okay and yeah I think that'll
 

741
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,919
she'll be okay and yeah I think that'll
work yeah all right so maybe what I'll

742
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:47,929
work yeah all right so maybe what I'll
 

743
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:51,190
work yeah all right so maybe what I'll
do is I'll just put some temporary

744
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
do is I'll just put some temporary
 

745
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,710
do is I'll just put some temporary
blocks here for now and we'll I'll

746
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:53,720
blocks here for now and we'll I'll
 

747
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,630
blocks here for now and we'll I'll
remove the cobble and we can see this in

748
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:55,640
remove the cobble and we can see this in
 

749
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,230
remove the cobble and we can see this in
action

750
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
action
 

751
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,230
action
because I don't really have time to do

752
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,240
because I don't really have time to do
 

753
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,390
because I don't really have time to do
all this wiring today I came in through

754
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
all this wiring today I came in through
 

755
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,340
all this wiring today I came in through
the ceiling here I'm going to just

756
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,350
the ceiling here I'm going to just
 

757
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,460
the ceiling here I'm going to just
remove them like this and get out of

758
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,470
remove them like this and get out of
 

759
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,330
remove them like this and get out of
here as quick as I can because these

760
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:13,340
here as quick as I can because these
 

761
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,710
here as quick as I can because these
guys are going to spawn in like crazy

762
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
guys are going to spawn in like crazy
 

763
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,719
guys are going to spawn in like crazy
now

764
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:19,729

 

765
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:22,459

yes is pretty dangerous I would

766
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:22,469
yes is pretty dangerous I would
 

767
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,499
yes is pretty dangerous I would
recommend putting your good stuff away

768
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:24,509
recommend putting your good stuff away
 

769
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:32,830
recommend putting your good stuff away
in chess before you attempt this is it's

770
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:32,840
in chess before you attempt this is it's
 

771
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,779
in chess before you attempt this is it's
pretty scary

772
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:34,789
pretty scary
 

773
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:37,099
pretty scary
make sure your full health all the time

774
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:37,109
make sure your full health all the time
 

775
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:42,320
make sure your full health all the time
or full full food they are able to fly

776
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,330
or full full food they are able to fly
 

777
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,320
or full full food they are able to fly
up that you so if you think they're

778
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,330
up that you so if you think they're
 

779
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,149
up that you so if you think they're
going to fall down from it to the bottom

780
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:47,159
going to fall down from it to the bottom
 

781
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,420
going to fall down from it to the bottom
there think again

782
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,430

 

783
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,310

ah dang that's that

784
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,320

 

785
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,140

the situation gets bad you can always

786
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,150
the situation gets bad you can always
 

787
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,140
the situation gets bad you can always
just block yourself in for a while to

788
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,150
just block yourself in for a while to
 

789
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,710
just block yourself in for a while to
recover and then try again or you know

790
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:07,720
recover and then try again or you know
 

791
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,090
recover and then try again or you know
the best thing probably is just to do it

792
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,100
the best thing probably is just to do it
 

793
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,140
the best thing probably is just to do it
from outside all around the sides

794
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,150
from outside all around the sides
 

795
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,280
from outside all around the sides
instead of actually going inside the

796
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,290
instead of actually going inside the
 

797
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:22,140
instead of actually going inside the
thing okay I think I got it all they're

thing in creative mode and I'll have to
 

835
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,250
thing in creative mode and I'll have to
put some blocks above the spawner there

put some blocks above the spawner there
 

837
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,550
