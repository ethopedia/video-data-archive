1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:33,210

that's right

2
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,220

 

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:55,970

so

4
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:55,980

 

5
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,410

yeah so what's going on here you're

6
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,420
yeah so what's going on here you're
 

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,730
yeah so what's going on here you're
wondering well I went ahead and finish

8
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:05,740
wondering well I went ahead and finish
 

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:18,840
wondering well I went ahead and finish
this up and hmm

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:18,850
this up and hmm
 

11
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,700
this up and hmm
sure upon what I was going to say I

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:22,710

 

13
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,100

didn't change a whole lot

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,110
didn't change a whole lot
 

15
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,480
didn't change a whole lot
or I mean I didn't do anything too

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,490
or I mean I didn't do anything too
 

17
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,290
or I mean I didn't do anything too
complicated I just put a glass case

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:31,300
complicated I just put a glass case
 

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,340
complicated I just put a glass case
around this thing

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,350
around this thing
 

21
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:44,749
around this thing
it's that - hi I have a door here so um

22
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:44,759

 

23
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,880

let's see in here this is where the

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:47,890
let's see in here this is where the
 

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,390
let's see in here this is where the
skeletons were supposed to be

26
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,400

 

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,290

from our second path here I wanted to

28
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,300
from our second path here I wanted to
 

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,360
from our second path here I wanted to
have like five skeletons in here for

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,370
have like five skeletons in here for
 

31
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:06,160
have like five skeletons in here for
more firepower and it's three blocks I

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,170
more firepower and it's three blocks I
 

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,440
more firepower and it's three blocks I
hear and the idea is they would jump up

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,450
hear and the idea is they would jump up
 

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,170
hear and the idea is they would jump up
if that door is open I'm standing in

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,180
if that door is open I'm standing in
 

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,850
if that door is open I'm standing in
front of it they would jump up they

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:15,860
front of it they would jump up they
 

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,740
front of it they would jump up they
would see me and they would shoot an

40
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,750
would see me and they would shoot an
 

41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,250
would see me and they would shoot an
arrow in that direction um it's kind of

42
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,260
arrow in that direction um it's kind of
 

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,370
arrow in that direction um it's kind of
hard to make them shoot at me

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:27,380
hard to make them shoot at me
 

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,480
hard to make them shoot at me
and keep them from joining the mobs in

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,490
and keep them from joining the mobs in
 

47
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,350
and keep them from joining the mobs in
the center here so I just put a block

48
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
the center here so I just put a block
 

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,010
the center here so I just put a block
and a half step and they only see me if

50
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,020
and a half step and they only see me if
 

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:50,890
and a half step and they only see me if
they jump I think but I just want to

52
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:50,900
they jump I think but I just want to
 

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,960
they jump I think but I just want to
show you guys this thing because I'm

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:52,970
show you guys this thing because I'm
 

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:06,500
show you guys this thing because I'm
going to have to redo this all

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,510

 

57
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:14,510

because um it barely works at the moment

58
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:14,520
because um it barely works at the moment
 

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,770
because um it barely works at the moment
because if there's more than one

60
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:16,780
because if there's more than one
 

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,220
because if there's more than one
skeleton in that room there they tend to

62
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,230
skeleton in that room there they tend to
 

63
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,350
skeleton in that room there they tend to
start shooting each other and they kill

64
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
start shooting each other and they kill
 

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,330
start shooting each other and they kill
each other the second issue is there

66
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,340
each other the second issue is there
 

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,220
each other the second issue is there
needs to be a two-block space here so

68
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,230
needs to be a two-block space here so
 

69
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,500
needs to be a two-block space here so
because if that creeper gets where I am

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,510
because if that creeper gets where I am
 

71
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,070
because if that creeper gets where I am
over here he's going to blow up the

72
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,080
over here he's going to blow up the
 

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:52,130
over here he's going to blow up the
skeletons in our shooting area here and

74
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,140

 

75
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,050

the main issue though is there's not

76
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,060
the main issue though is there's not
 

77
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,810
the main issue though is there's not
enough firepower it takes too long for

78
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:57,820
enough firepower it takes too long for
 

79
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,410
enough firepower it takes too long for
the one skeleton to shoot down all these

80
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,420
the one skeleton to shoot down all these
 

81
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:19,409
the one skeleton to shoot down all these
mobs as that room fills up really fast

82
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:19,419

 

83
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,870

and stop the video here okay so I'm

84
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:25,880
and stop the video here okay so I'm
 

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,150
and stop the video here okay so I'm
going to show you guys how I was loading

86
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
going to show you guys how I was loading
 

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,180
going to show you guys how I was loading
the skeletons into the replace skeleton

88
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,190
the skeletons into the replace skeleton
 

89
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,909
the skeletons into the replace skeleton
just came up here so we're going to

90
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:32,919
just came up here so we're going to
 

91
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:44,219
just came up here so we're going to
switch the junction a little quick

92
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:44,229

 

93
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:56,050

hopefully got another one I think you

94
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,060
hopefully got another one I think you
 

95
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,430
hopefully got another one I think you
got one in there I guess even jumping

96
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
got one in there I guess even jumping
 

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:12,370
got one in there I guess even jumping
around into that very few of his shots

98
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,380
around into that very few of his shots
 

99
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,210
around into that very few of his shots
back to hitting these guys so I'm going

100
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:16,220
back to hitting these guys so I'm going
 

101
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,070
back to hitting these guys so I'm going
to have to change a lot of things about

102
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
to have to change a lot of things about
 

103
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,130
to have to change a lot of things about
this

104
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,140

 

105
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,850

so I'm going to tell you what I'm going

106
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:26,860
so I'm going to tell you what I'm going
 

107
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:36,780
so I'm going to tell you what I'm going
to do for one thing I'm going to change

108
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:36,790
to do for one thing I'm going to change
 

109
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,590
to do for one thing I'm going to change
all these tunnels around there's going

110
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:40,600
all these tunnels around there's going
 

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:49,800
all these tunnels around there's going
to be a junction closer here and one

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:49,810
to be a junction closer here and one
 

113
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,780
to be a junction closer here and one
path is going to go into this room but

114
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:51,790
path is going to go into this room but
 

115
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,240
path is going to go into this room but
before it does that it's going to run by

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,250
before it does that it's going to run by
 

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,430
before it does that it's going to run by
a few cactuses to damage the mobs so

118
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
a few cactuses to damage the mobs so
 

119
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,250
a few cactuses to damage the mobs so
ideally when they enter this room they

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:02,260
ideally when they enter this room they
 

121
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,220
ideally when they enter this room they
only got one hit point left so one arrow

122
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,230
only got one hit point left so one arrow
 

123
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,310
only got one hit point left so one arrow
one arrow will take them down hopefully

124
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,320

 

125
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,280

ideally so I'm going to pass somebody a

126
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,290
ideally so I'm going to pass somebody a
 

127
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,420
ideally so I'm going to pass somebody a
few cactuses and other thing I'm going

128
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,430
few cactuses and other thing I'm going
 

129
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,030
few cactuses and other thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to put them I'm going

130
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,040
to do is I'm going to put them I'm going
 

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,300
to do is I'm going to put them I'm going
to build a room with no water in it and

132
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,310
to build a room with no water in it and
 

133
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,320
to build a room with no water in it and
a glass roof and the sunlight is going

134
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,330
a glass roof and the sunlight is going
 

135
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,580
a glass roof and the sunlight is going
to kill the zombies and the skeletons to

136
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:32,590
to kill the zombies and the skeletons to
 

137
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,030
to kill the zombies and the skeletons to
separate them out so that only creepers

138
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,040
separate them out so that only creepers
 

139
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,330
separate them out so that only creepers
will enter this chamber

140
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,340

 

141
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,790

and then I'll have the second tunnel for

142
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
and then I'll have the second tunnel for
 

143
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,300
and then I'll have the second tunnel for
the skeletons to get into their

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,310
the skeletons to get into their
 

145
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:58,310
the skeletons to get into their
designated area so I'm carve up probably

146
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,320
designated area so I'm carve up probably
 

147
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,950
designated area so I'm carve up probably
gonna build that off-camera since I've

148
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
gonna build that off-camera since I've
 

149
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,810
gonna build that off-camera since I've
showed you guys how I do the tunneling

150
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:02,820
showed you guys how I do the tunneling
 

151
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,370
showed you guys how I do the tunneling
already you there won't be anything new

152
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,380
already you there won't be anything new
 

153
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:20,060
already you there won't be anything new
there oh yeah I said it before I'm

154
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,070
there oh yeah I said it before I'm
 

155
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:26,990
there oh yeah I said it before I'm
pretty much out of class and sand I'm

156
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,000
pretty much out of class and sand I'm
 

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,040
pretty much out of class and sand I'm
going to show you guys where I've been

158
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,050
going to show you guys where I've been
 

159
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:36,860
going to show you guys where I've been
getting the sand from just in case

160
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:36,870
getting the sand from just in case
 

161
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,700
getting the sand from just in case
you're interested

162
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:37,710
you're interested
 

163
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,620
you're interested
I really haven't explored much away from

164
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:42,630
I really haven't explored much away from
 

165
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,590
I really haven't explored much away from
this island yet so I'm hoping we'll go

166
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:45,600
this island yet so I'm hoping we'll go
 

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,360
this island yet so I'm hoping we'll go
on some kind of exploring mission to

168
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,370
on some kind of exploring mission to
 

169
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,800
on some kind of exploring mission to
find sand and cactus soon but I've just

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:54,810
find sand and cactus soon but I've just
 

171
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,930
find sand and cactus soon but I've just
been hollowing this out to get sand so

172
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:56,940
been hollowing this out to get sand so
 

173
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,570
been hollowing this out to get sand so
far so hopefully we'll find a desert

174
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:02,580
far so hopefully we'll find a desert
 

175
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,180
far so hopefully we'll find a desert
somewhere so I'm going to start working

176
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,190
somewhere so I'm going to start working
 

177
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,530
somewhere so I'm going to start working
on that and I'll see you in a bit

178
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:14,540

 

179
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,030

alright this is a bit of a progress

180
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,040
alright this is a bit of a progress
 

181
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,999
alright this is a bit of a progress
update

182
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,009
update
 

183
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:33,130
update
I was gonna test again

184
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,140

 

185
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,300

to see if you can compress the mobs into

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,310
to see if you can compress the mobs into
 

187
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,500
to see if you can compress the mobs into
a one-block space just by dropping them

188
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,510
a one-block space just by dropping them
 

189
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:48,290
a one-block space just by dropping them
and you can if it's three blocks deep so

190
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,300
and you can if it's three blocks deep so
 

191
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,680
and you can if it's three blocks deep so
they they fall unlock two blocks three

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:51,690
they they fall unlock two blocks three
 

193
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,430
they they fall unlock two blocks three
blocks doesn't work if it's only two or

194
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
blocks doesn't work if it's only two or
 

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:09,889
blocks doesn't work if it's only two or
not very well J and so instead of having

196
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899
not very well J and so instead of having
 

197
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,710
not very well J and so instead of having
a Junction like this I've kind of

198
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
a Junction like this I've kind of
 

199
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:21,590
a Junction like this I've kind of
invented a new type sort of so this is a

200
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
invented a new type sort of so this is a
 

201
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,370
invented a new type sort of so this is a
one block wide stream and it's only two

202
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,380
one block wide stream and it's only two
 

203
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,680
one block wide stream and it's only two
blocks high so they can't jump and then

204
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,690
blocks high so they can't jump and then
 

205
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,100
blocks high so they can't jump and then
they approached the stream over here

206
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,110
they approached the stream over here
 

207
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,990
they approached the stream over here
there's a water source over here which

208
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
there's a water source over here which
 

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,780
there's a water source over here which
creates a diagonals low it's too wide

210
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:41,790
creates a diagonals low it's too wide
 

211
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,990
creates a diagonals low it's too wide
and that makes them brush against this

212
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,000
and that makes them brush against this
 

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,350
and that makes them brush against this
door so if this door is open they go in

214
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
door so if this door is open they go in
 

215
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,610
door so if this door is open they go in
then you can close it and that's how you

216
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:55,620
then you can close it and that's how you
 

217
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,150
then you can close it and that's how you
can separate the skeletons out and the

218
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,160
can separate the skeletons out and the
 

219
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:07,870
can separate the skeletons out and the
other guys they just keep on going and

220
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:07,880

 

221
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,080

they're going to go to our compression

222
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,090
they're going to go to our compression
 

223
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,810
they're going to go to our compression
room where the sunlight kills everything

224
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:14,820
room where the sunlight kills everything
 

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,650
room where the sunlight kills everything

mob separator this is one way you can do

234
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,180
mob separator this is one way you can do
 

235
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,900
mob separator this is one way you can do
it have this diagnosed stream and have

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:41,910
it have this diagnosed stream and have
 

237
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,460
it have this diagnosed stream and have
it only two blocks high so they can't

238
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,470
it only two blocks high so they can't
 

239
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,370
it only two blocks high so they can't
jump and have three doors spaced one

240
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,380
jump and have three doors spaced one
 

241
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,360
jump and have three doors spaced one
block of parts and fits a creeper open

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,120
or zombie zombie door something like
this that's a very simple way of doing

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,130
this that's a very simple way of doing
 

249
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,000
this that's a very simple way of doing
it you still have issues of their

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,010
it you still have issues of their
 

251
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:19,340
it you still have issues of their
clumped together so so you can do this

252
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,350
clumped together so so you can do this
 

253
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,760
clumped together so so you can do this
water back so that they run by here

254
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:22,770
water back so that they run by here
 

255
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,770
water back so that they run by here
again but if you do that let me clock

256
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:24,780
again but if you do that let me clock
 

257
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,260
again but if you do that let me clock

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,270
together which is an issue Zhou has or
 

259
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,960
together which is an issue Zhou has or
you could just send them to a killing

260
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:32,970
you could just send them to a killing
 

261
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,780
you could just send them to a killing
chamber and

262
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,790

 

263
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:42,380

and just try to separate them as there

264
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,390
and just try to separate them as there
 

265
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,540
and just try to separate them as there
as they come up here from the spawning

266
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,550
as they come up here from the spawning
 

267
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,330
as they come up here from the spawning
beds instead of trying to send them back

268
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,340
beds instead of trying to send them back
 

269
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,880
beds instead of trying to send them back
through here it's kind of like a

270
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:52,890
through here it's kind of like a
 

271
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,490
through here it's kind of like a
conveyor system you know if they miss it

272
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:55,500
conveyor system you know if they miss it
 

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,820
conveyor system you know if they miss it
it's it's a it doesn't come back through

274
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:01,830
it's it's a it doesn't come back through
 

275
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,840
it's it's a it doesn't come back through
the conveyor just I don't know what I'm

276
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,850
the conveyor just I don't know what I'm
 

277
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:15,710
the conveyor just I don't know what I'm
saying you get the idea so I am going to

278
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:15,720
saying you get the idea so I am going to
 

279
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,490
saying you get the idea so I am going to
deal with the deeper separator here oh

280
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:18,500
deal with the deeper separator here oh
 

281
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,900
deal with the deeper separator here oh
yeah another thing we need to check is

282
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:20,910
yeah another thing we need to check is
 

283
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:30,170
yeah another thing we need to check is
this table walk through here dig a hole

284
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,180
this table walk through here dig a hole
 

285
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,360
this table walk through here dig a hole
here and see if they walk yes city

286
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,370

 

287
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,740

that's good so we can put a door and

288
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:42,750
that's good so we can put a door and
 

289
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,660
that's good so we can put a door and
I'll see you in a bit I'm going to work

290
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:44,670
I'll see you in a bit I'm going to work
 

291
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,510
I'll see you in a bit I'm going to work
on that some more all right we're back

292
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:49,520
on that some more all right we're back
 

293
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,340
on that some more all right we're back
we're about to do our first test here

294
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,350
we're about to do our first test here
 

295
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,600
we're about to do our first test here
with what I got built this moon is going

296
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:56,610
with what I got built this moon is going
 

297
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,490
with what I got built this moon is going
down so Sun will be coming up soon so

298
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:03,500

 

299
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,800

they're coming through here

300
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:11,810

 

301
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,480

got a door here with the lever when I

302
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,490
got a door here with the lever when I
 

303
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,879
got a door here with the lever when I
put it down I should go through I don't

304
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:22,889
put it down I should go through I don't
 

305
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,600
put it down I should go through I don't
have any water in here yet I just want

306
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:26,610
have any water in here yet I just want
 

307
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,499
have any water in here yet I just want
to make sure they don't get stuck on the

308
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:29,509
to make sure they don't get stuck on the
 

309
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,579
to make sure they don't get stuck on the
but they don't get stuck on the door

310
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:31,589
but they don't get stuck on the door
 

311
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:39,139
but they don't get stuck on the door
hinge when I open it obviously a flaw

312
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:39,149
hinge when I open it obviously a flaw
 

313
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,819
hinge when I open it obviously a flaw
with this is you have to wait for the

314
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:40,829
with this is you have to wait for the
 

315
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:47,540
with this is you have to wait for the
Sun to come up but how to big deal it's

316
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,550
Sun to come up but how to big deal it's
 

317
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,280
Sun to come up but how to big deal it's
not like you need a ton of Records so

318
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,290
not like you need a ton of Records so
 

319
00:13:52,290 --> 00:14:24,569
not like you need a ton of Records so
you would shut this down

320
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:24,579

 

321
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,129

and you're left with nothing with

322
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,139
and you're left with nothing with
 

323
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,410
and you're left with nothing with
creepers in a one block wide tube yeah

324
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,420
creepers in a one block wide tube yeah
 

325
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,750
creepers in a one block wide tube yeah
so I flicked this junction to stop the

326
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:34,760
so I flicked this junction to stop the
 

327
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,860
so I flicked this junction to stop the
stream of mobs from going here so let no

328
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:38,870
stream of mobs from going here so let no
 

329
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,889
stream of mobs from going here so let no
new ones enter and we can even pick up

330
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:44,899
new ones enter and we can even pick up
 

331
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:50,139
new ones enter and we can even pick up
the items from the mobs that died which

332
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,149
the items from the mobs that died which
 

333
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,990
the items from the mobs that died which
is cool

334
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
is cool
 

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,920
is cool
and so here's our tests this is just an

336
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:56,930
and so here's our tests this is just an
 

337
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,240
and so here's our tests this is just an
maintenance store the goal is to get

338
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,250
maintenance store the goal is to get
 

339
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,650
maintenance store the goal is to get
them all through there without getting

340
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:02,660
them all through there without getting
 

341
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:11,829
them all through there without getting
stuck on the hinge darn

342
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
stuck on the hinge darn
 

343
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:22,780
stuck on the hinge darn
okay it's working yeah so I'm gonna have

344
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:22,790
okay it's working yeah so I'm gonna have
 

345
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:30,370
okay it's working yeah so I'm gonna have
to change it around a bit you going to

346
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:30,380
to change it around a bit you going to
 

347
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:40,810
to change it around a bit you going to
try maybe using two boys

348
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:40,820

 

349
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:49,780

all right I'll see you a bit fix that

350
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:49,790

 

351
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,180

this is a real challenge to get working

352
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,190
this is a real challenge to get working
 

353
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:00,410
this is a real challenge to get working
properly what I've done now is I messed

354
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,420
properly what I've done now is I messed
 

355
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,280
properly what I've done now is I messed
around with using double doors and then

356
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,290
around with using double doors and then
 

357
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,620
around with using double doors and then
have much improvement so now I have a

358
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,630
have much improvement so now I have a
 

359
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,120
have much improvement so now I have a
single door again but it's a position

360
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,130
single door again but it's a position
 

361
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,820
single door again but it's a position
other way and we're going to set up our

362
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:19,830
other way and we're going to set up our
 

363
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,470
other way and we're going to set up our
water stream here and pressure plates

364
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
water stream here and pressure plates
 

365
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:33,680
water stream here and pressure plates
and sign hold the water and we're going

366
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:33,690
and sign hold the water and we're going
 

367
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:42,290
and sign hold the water and we're going
to put a water stream here and we are

368
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:42,300
to put a water stream here and we are
 

369
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:53,400
to put a water stream here and we are
going to put a water stream here

370
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,410

 

371
00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:11,890

switch over to easy and I'm going to let

372
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:11,900
switch over to easy and I'm going to let
 

373
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,199
switch over to easy and I'm going to let
a few mobs collect and I'll show you

374
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,209
a few mobs collect and I'll show you
 

375
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:20,920
a few mobs collect and I'll show you
what it's doing now okay it's been a few

376
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:20,930
what it's doing now okay it's been a few
 

377
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,020
what it's doing now okay it's been a few
minutes now the sun's in close to

378
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,030
minutes now the sun's in close to
 

379
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:37,650
minutes now the sun's in close to
setting so we're going to switch this so

380
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:37,660

 

381
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,350

area down here is about two blocks

382
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,360
area down here is about two blocks
 

383
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,830
area down here is about two blocks
instead of just one and you'll notice

384
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
instead of just one and you'll notice
 

385
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,630
instead of just one and you'll notice
the creepers are kind of bouncing back

386
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:49,640
the creepers are kind of bouncing back
 

387
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,150
the creepers are kind of bouncing back
and forth between the two blocks what

388
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,160
and forth between the two blocks what
 

389
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,670
and forth between the two blocks what
happens is when this door opens it opens

390
00:17:59,670 --> 00:17:59,680
happens is when this door opens it opens
 

391
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,030
happens is when this door opens it opens
inside towards the creepers so that

392
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,040
inside towards the creepers so that
 

393
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,490
inside towards the creepers so that
they're inside the door so it doesn't

394
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:06,500
they're inside the door so it doesn't
 

395
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,100
they're inside the door so it doesn't
get in the way and then it clears space

396
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,110
get in the way and then it clears space
 

397
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,090
get in the way and then it clears space
for more creepers to get in that that

398
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,100
for more creepers to get in that that
 

399
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,360
for more creepers to get in that that
door space their only issue is can't

400
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,370
door space their only issue is can't
 

401
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:28,000
door space their only issue is can't
pick up all of these items

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,010

 

403
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,919

so I'm gonna show you this little kit

404
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:30,929
so I'm gonna show you this little kit
 

405
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:49,100
so I'm gonna show you this little kit
here slide through the answer is a

406
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,110
here slide through the answer is a
 

407
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:55,850
here slide through the answer is a
creeper chamber here obviously you can

408
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:55,860
creeper chamber here obviously you can
 

409
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,760
creeper chamber here obviously you can
only hold so many so this is actually a

410
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,770
only hold so many so this is actually a
 

411
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,070
only hold so many so this is actually a
good amount I still don't have the

412
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
good amount I still don't have the
 

413
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,779
good amount I still don't have the
skeleton thing set up and so say you get

414
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:11,789
skeleton thing set up and so say you get
 

415
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,730
skeleton thing set up and so say you get
records from all those guys and kill

416
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:13,740
records from all those guys and kill
 

417
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,909
records from all those guys and kill
them all and you still have a bunch of

418
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:16,919
them all and you still have a bunch of
 

419
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,950
them all and you still have a bunch of
creepers here what you do is you flip

420
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
creepers here what you do is you flip
 

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,020
creepers here what you do is you flip
this door closes and then creepers can

422
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,030
this door closes and then creepers can
 

423
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,560
this door closes and then creepers can
enter that door space again you know

424
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:27,570
enter that door space again you know
 

425
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,810
enter that door space again you know
it's filling up again then when you're

426
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:32,820
it's filling up again then when you're
 

427
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,240
it's filling up again then when you're
ready for the next batch Oh like when

428
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,250
ready for the next batch Oh like when
 

429
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,560
ready for the next batch Oh like when
you're ready for the next batch just

430
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,570
you're ready for the next batch just
 

431
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,570
you're ready for the next batch just
flick it open here and use a bunch more

432
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:46,580

 

433
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,649

you can't get them all to go through but

434
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:50,659
you can't get them all to go through but
 

435
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:57,530
you can't get them all to go through but
it works pretty decently

436
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:57,540

 

437
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,620

the only other better way of doing it

438
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,630
the only other better way of doing it
 

439
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,250
the only other better way of doing it
that I can think of is placing water

440
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,260
that I can think of is placing water
 

441
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,530
that I can think of is placing water
sources and moving blocks around which

442
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:07,540
sources and moving blocks around which
 

443
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:15,850
sources and moving blocks around which
is not what I consider automated

444
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:15,860

 

445
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,180

so next thing I'm going to do is work on

446
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,190
so next thing I'm going to do is work on
 

447
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,169
so next thing I'm going to do is work on
redesigning the skeleton the shooters

448
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:23,179
redesigning the skeleton the shooters
 

449
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:31,299
redesigning the skeleton the shooters
range here and hooking up the tunnel to

450
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:31,309
range here and hooking up the tunnel to
 

451
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,789
range here and hooking up the tunnel to
get the skeletons in here but this

452
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
get the skeletons in here but this
 

453
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,440
get the skeletons in here but this
episode is running long so I'm going to

454
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,450
episode is running long so I'm going to
 

455

episode is running long so I'm going to
end it here and thanks for watching I'll

456
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,110
