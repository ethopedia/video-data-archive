and stuff WAIS is still hard to break

168
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:17,910
and stuff WAIS is still hard to break

his stupid haste beacon I can break the

170
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:20,789
his stupid haste beacon I can break the
 

171
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,690
his stupid haste beacon I can break the
the ice easy like going along this way

172
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:23,700
the ice easy like going along this way
 

173
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,960
the ice easy like going along this way
but then I hit the wall

174
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:26,970
but then I hit the wall
 

175
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,570
but then I hit the wall
and then I break two blocks but yeah I

176
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:32,580
and then I break two blocks but yeah I
 

177
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,960
and then I break two blocks but yeah I
made a backup of my world before I

178
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:34,970
made a backup of my world before I
 

179
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,280
made a backup of my world before I
started like placing this ice here

180
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,290
started like placing this ice here
 

181
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,650
started like placing this ice here
because I'm not sure we're gonna exactly

182
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:39,660
because I'm not sure we're gonna exactly
 

183
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,260
because I'm not sure we're gonna exactly
want to flood this just yet just in case

184
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,270
want to flood this just yet just in case
 

185
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,630
want to flood this just yet just in case
there's an issue and it's like oh I wish

186
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:44,640
there's an issue and it's like oh I wish
 

187
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,000
there's an issue and it's like oh I wish
I didn't flood it I should have did this

188
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,010
I didn't flood it I should have did this
 

189
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,470
I didn't flood it I should have did this
before I flooded it

190
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:48,480
before I flooded it
 

191
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,320
before I flooded it
I want to back up because once this is

192
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,330
I want to back up because once this is
 

193
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,200
I want to back up because once this is
flooded it's flooded and I am not

194
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,210
flooded it's flooded and I am not
 

195
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,290
flooded it's flooded and I am not
removing the water ever it would take

196
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,300
removing the water ever it would take
 

197
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,140
removing the water ever it would take
way too long even with like stacks of

198
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,150
way too long even with like stacks of
 

199
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,910
way too long even with like stacks of
sponges to get rid of all the water

200
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:01,920
sponges to get rid of all the water
 

201
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,870
sponges to get rid of all the water
that's gonna be in this hole no not

202
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
that's gonna be in this hole no not
 

203
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:13,010
that's gonna be in this hole no not
gonna happen so I thought I could just

204
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,020
gonna happen so I thought I could just
 

205
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,650
gonna happen so I thought I could just
zip by and break all the ice and then we

206
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:15,660
zip by and break all the ice and then we
 

207
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,180
zip by and break all the ice and then we
could see it flood on camera and it

208
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,190
could see it flood on camera and it
 

209
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,220
could see it flood on camera and it
would be amazing but this is so slow

210
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,230
would be amazing but this is so slow
 

211
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,770
would be amazing but this is so slow
come on we're almost there so I'm just

212
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
come on we're almost there so I'm just
 

213
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,080
come on we're almost there so I'm just
gonna do one layer to start off with I

214
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,090
gonna do one layer to start off with I
 

215
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,320
gonna do one layer to start off with I
want to confirm what what layer these

216
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,330
want to confirm what what layer these
 

217
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,110
want to confirm what what layer these
Guardians spawn at because I'm not sure

218
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
Guardians spawn at because I'm not sure
 

219
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,180
Guardians spawn at because I'm not sure
if they do exactly spawn on on this

220
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,190
if they do exactly spawn on on this
 

221
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,550
if they do exactly spawn on on this
bottom layer we'll have to see here it

222
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
bottom layer we'll have to see here it
 

223
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,590
bottom layer we'll have to see here it
goes

224
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600

will it be able to keep up rendering

226
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
will it be able to keep up rendering
 

227
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,690
will it be able to keep up rendering
while recording it looks pretty good

228
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:47,700
while recording it looks pretty good
 

229
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,930
while recording it looks pretty good
look at that there's no sometimes when

230
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:50,940
look at that there's no sometimes when
 

231
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,270
look at that there's no sometimes when
you flood big areas like this like you

232
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
you flood big areas like this like you
 

233
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,790
you flood big areas like this like you
you don't see it it just happens all at

234
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800
you don't see it it just happens all at
 

235
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,210
you don't see it it just happens all at
once

236
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,220
once
 

237
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,420
once
instantly it can't render it it's it

238
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,430
instantly it can't render it it's it
 

239
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,920
instantly it can't render it it's it
seems like it's keeping up really good

240
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:00,930
seems like it's keeping up really good
 

241
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,659
seems like it's keeping up really good
though let's get in front of the wave ah

242
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:04,669
though let's get in front of the wave ah
 

243
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:11,050

it's so cool such such a good snapshot

244
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,060
it's so cool such such a good snapshot
 

245
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,850
it's so cool such such a good snapshot
all right so that's one layer done I'm

246
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:13,860
all right so that's one layer done I'm
 

247
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,690
all right so that's one layer done I'm
gonna just like wait a while if we're

248
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:17,700
gonna just like wait a while if we're
 

249
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,490
gonna just like wait a while if we're
extremely lucky we might see it happen

250
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:19,500
extremely lucky we might see it happen
 

251
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
extremely lucky we might see it happen
on camera here even but I want to see if

252
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,810
on camera here even but I want to see if
 

253
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,020
on camera here even but I want to see if
anything spawns in that yeah it doesn't

254
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,030
anything spawns in that yeah it doesn't
 

255
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,670
anything spawns in that yeah it doesn't
look like they're gonna spawn in just

256
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
look like they're gonna spawn in just
 

257
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,890
look like they're gonna spawn in just
this first layer so maybe it's outside

258
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:30,900
this first layer so maybe it's outside
 

259
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,450
this first layer so maybe it's outside
of their spawning range we're gonna

260
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,460
of their spawning range we're gonna
 

261
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,159
of their spawning range we're gonna
flood the second one we got quite the

262
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,169
flood the second one we got quite the
 

263
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,010
flood the second one we got quite the
mob trap going down there - under the

264
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,020
mob trap going down there - under the
 

265
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,030
mob trap going down there - under the
water

266
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,040
water
 

267
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,040
water
have to light it up oh man that looks so

268
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,050
have to light it up oh man that looks so
 

269
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,980
have to light it up oh man that looks so
cool yeah we're just gonna do one layer

270
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:48,990
cool yeah we're just gonna do one layer
 

271
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,110
cool yeah we're just gonna do one layer
at a time here until we confirm that

272
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
at a time here until we confirm that
 

273
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,870
at a time here until we confirm that
they start spawning somewhere and then

274
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
they start spawning somewhere and then
 

275
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,460
they start spawning somewhere and then
we'll do them oh yeah right there

276
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,470
we'll do them oh yeah right there
 

277
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,010
we'll do them oh yeah right there
we got one already we got two this is

278
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,020
we got one already we got two this is
 

279
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,160
we got one already we got two this is
the lair this is where they spawn so we

280
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,170
the lair this is where they spawn so we
 

281
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,810
the lair this is where they spawn so we
were one layer off there that why well

282
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:05,820
were one layer off there that why well
 

283
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,040
were one layer off there that why well
when it says why 41 is what you want at

284
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,050
when it says why 41 is what you want at
 

285
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,570
when it says why 41 is what you want at
at your head they don't spawn at this

286
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:11,580
at your head they don't spawn at this
 

287
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,740
at your head they don't spawn at this
first one okay

288
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,750
first one okay
 

289
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,940
first one okay
hey guy all right good to know so that

290
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:19,950
hey guy all right good to know so that
 

291
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,310
hey guy all right good to know so that
means for the rest of this flooding I

292
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,320
means for the rest of this flooding I
 

293
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,590
means for the rest of this flooding I
can do pillars up I believe so instead

294
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:27,600
can do pillars up I believe so instead
 

295
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,680
can do pillars up I believe so instead
of doing it like block here block here

296
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:30,690
of doing it like block here block here
 

297
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,330
of doing it like block here block here
and then breaking them I'm gonna go on

298
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,340
and then breaking them I'm gonna go on
 

299
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,690
and then breaking them I'm gonna go on
top and I'm gonna do just pillars all

300
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:35,700
top and I'm gonna do just pillars all
 

301
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,780
top and I'm gonna do just pillars all
the way up and then break them going

302
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:38,790
the way up and then break them going
 

303
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,560
the way up and then break them going
down kind of like yeah here I'll show

304
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,570
down kind of like yeah here I'll show
 

305
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,240
down kind of like yeah here I'll show
you one Oh should we go higher I think

306
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,250
you one Oh should we go higher I think
 

307
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,910
you one Oh should we go higher I think
this is probably good I think we can

308
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:49,920
this is probably good I think we can
 

309
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,230
this is probably good I think we can
just do this we break when we break all

310
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
just do this we break when we break all
 

311
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
just do this we break when we break all
the columns of ice then the whole thing

312
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:56,730
the columns of ice then the whole thing
 

313
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,760
the columns of ice then the whole thing
will flood it once and this is a lot

314
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:58,770
will flood it once and this is a lot
 

315
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:08,690
will flood it once and this is a lot
easier um so it might be back up loading

316
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:08,700
easier um so it might be back up loading
 

317
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,910
easier um so it might be back up loading
time guys because if you look above us

318
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:12,920
time guys because if you look above us
 

319
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,580
time guys because if you look above us
there's like at all times 15 to 20

320
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:16,590
there's like at all times 15 to 20
 

321
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,370
there's like at all times 15 to 20
guardians in the water here and it's

322
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,380
guardians in the water here and it's
 

323
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,860
guardians in the water here and it's
only two layers deep so their spawn

324
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:24,870
only two layers deep so their spawn
 

325
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,290
only two layers deep so their spawn
rates are pretty good a lot better than

326
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,300
rates are pretty good a lot better than
 

327
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,480
rates are pretty good a lot better than
I was expecting

328
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:29,490
I was expecting
 

329
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,829
I was expecting
which means this hole I dug might be

330
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
which means this hole I dug might be
 

331
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,810
which means this hole I dug might be
SuperDuper overkill so rather than

332
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:39,820
SuperDuper overkill so rather than
 

333
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,100
SuperDuper overkill so rather than
filling this whole thing with water

334
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,110
filling this whole thing with water
 

335
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,750
filling this whole thing with water
we'll just make a little tank in the

336
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
we'll just make a little tank in the
 

337
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,810
we'll just make a little tank in the
middle and fill that with water I think

338
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:45,820
middle and fill that with water I think
 

339
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,620
middle and fill that with water I think
is the way to go here yeah

340
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:51,630
is the way to go here yeah
 

341
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,570
is the way to go here yeah
all right guys let's fast forward in

342
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,580
all right guys let's fast forward in
 

343
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,360
all right guys let's fast forward in
time now and check out my new fish tank

344
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,370
time now and check out my new fish tank
 

345
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,970
time now and check out my new fish tank
I loaded the back up and I just built a

346
00:08:59,970 --> 00:08:59,980
I loaded the back up and I just built a
 

347
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,100
I loaded the back up and I just built a
tank in the middle here we're about to

348
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,110
tank in the middle here we're about to
 

349
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,440
tank in the middle here we're about to
flood it and hopefully this works out

350
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,450
flood it and hopefully this works out
 

351
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,530
flood it and hopefully this works out
okay or I'll be very sad

352
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:07,540
okay or I'll be very sad
 

353
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,960
okay or I'll be very sad
it is spotting them in already even

354
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:09,970
it is spotting them in already even
 

355
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,620
it is spotting them in already even
though there's not really any water here

356
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,630
though there's not really any water here
 

357
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,740
though there's not really any water here
so yeah like I said earlier or last

358
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,750
so yeah like I said earlier or last
 

359
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,120
so yeah like I said earlier or last
episode this whole thing is an

360
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,130
episode this whole thing is an
 

361
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,130
episode this whole thing is an
experiment for me I'm having fun just

362
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,140
experiment for me I'm having fun just
 

363
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,710
experiment for me I'm having fun just
testing things out seeing how it works

364
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
testing things out seeing how it works
 

365
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,590
testing things out seeing how it works
and so I might change things around

366
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
and so I might change things around
 

367
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,060
and so I might change things around
every every so often with this but yeah

368
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,070
every every so often with this but yeah
 

369
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,620
every every so often with this but yeah
this should work I'm pretty sure it'll

370
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:34,630
this should work I'm pretty sure it'll
 

371
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,740
this should work I'm pretty sure it'll
work the cool thing is since we dug out

372
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,750
work the cool thing is since we dug out
 

373
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,000
work the cool thing is since we dug out
all the sides even though that was a

374
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,010
all the sides even though that was a
 

375
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,949
all the sides even though that was a
waste of time we have this awesome view

376
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
waste of time we have this awesome view
 

377
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,750
waste of time we have this awesome view
of the thing left side view that we went

378
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:42,760
of the thing left side view that we went
 

379
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,480
of the thing left side view that we went
in a pet before it's not a total waste

380
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,490
in a pet before it's not a total waste
 

381
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,540
in a pet before it's not a total waste
straight where they spawn er they spawn

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,550
straight where they spawn er they spawn

if squid and and like these guys spawned

390
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
if squid and and like these guys spawned
 

391
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,990
if squid and and like these guys spawned
oh you know what we can't tell if they

392
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,000
oh you know what we can't tell if they
 

393
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,540
oh you know what we can't tell if they
spawn in flowing water or if it has to

394
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:03,550
spawn in flowing water or if it has to
 

395
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,579
spawn in flowing water or if it has to
be source blocks the thing is there is

396
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:05,589
be source blocks the thing is there is
 

397
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,420
be source blocks the thing is there is
source blocks in in the wall there so

398
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,430
source blocks in in the wall there so
 

399
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,210
source blocks in in the wall there so
yeah this isn't a good way to figure out

400
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,220
yeah this isn't a good way to figure out
 

401
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,760
yeah this isn't a good way to figure out
Wow even with this just a little bit of

402
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:14,770
Wow even with this just a little bit of
 

403
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,230
Wow even with this just a little bit of
water look how many we're getting in

404
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
water look how many we're getting in
 

405
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,430
water look how many we're getting in
such a short time

406
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440

 

407
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760

it's pretty crazy all right

408
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:23,770
it's pretty crazy all right
 

409
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,100
it's pretty crazy all right
anyway now I can't go in there because

410
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,110
anyway now I can't go in there because
 

411
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,480
anyway now I can't go in there because
they're gonna kill me ah darn it you see

412
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,490
they're gonna kill me ah darn it you see
 

413
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,160
they're gonna kill me ah darn it you see
that dirt block over there that's what

414
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,170
that dirt block over there that's what
 

415
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,519
that dirt block over there that's what
we need to get to and now I'm not sure

416
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:35,529
we need to get to and now I'm not sure
 

417
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,540
we need to get to and now I'm not sure
we can do it like they're guarding it

418
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:39,550
we can do it like they're guarding it
 

419
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,269
we can do it like they're guarding it
the guardians are guarding the whole

420
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:42,279
the guardians are guarding the whole
 

421
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,269
the guardians are guarding the whole
thing here

422
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
thing here
 

423
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,670
thing here
we this feels like a waste I kind of

424
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
we this feels like a waste I kind of
 

425
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,319
we this feels like a waste I kind of
wanted to do it from the inside but I

426
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:50,329
wanted to do it from the inside but I
 

427
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,269
wanted to do it from the inside but I
don't think we can't because they will

428
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:52,279
don't think we can't because they will
 

429
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,050
don't think we can't because they will
kill me as soon as we break this this

430
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,060
kill me as soon as we break this this
 

431
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,139
kill me as soon as we break this this
ice here it should create water all the

432
00:10:59,139 --> 00:10:59,149
ice here it should create water all the
 

433
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,429
ice here it should create water all the
way up to the top maybe we will

434
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:00,439
way up to the top maybe we will
 

435
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,799
way up to the top maybe we will
enderpearl to the side try to do it

436
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:02,809
enderpearl to the side try to do it
 

437
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,230
enderpearl to the side try to do it
quickly and wait will that create water

438
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,240
quickly and wait will that create water
 

439
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,600
quickly and wait will that create water
hey guy hey how's it go what's going on

440

hey guy hey how's it go what's going on
 

441
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,590
hey guy hey how's it go what's going on
don't know if that's gonna create water

442
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:14,600
don't know if that's gonna create water
 

443
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,360
don't know if that's gonna create water
actually it's we need a block below but

444
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,370
actually it's we need a block below but
 

445
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,069
actually it's we need a block below but
just in case let's go oh it is going

446
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:21,079
just in case let's go oh it is going
 

447
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,569
just in case let's go oh it is going
look at that holy smokes

448
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:25,579
look at that holy smokes
 

449
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:29,559

oh that's so cool you can actually see
 

451
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:33,660
oh that's so cool you can actually see
water updating now like I've never

452
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:33,670
water updating now like I've never
 

453
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,189
water updating now like I've never
before I would just be like nope

454
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:36,199
before I would just be like nope
 

455
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:44,220
before I would just be like nope
can't see it oh it's all done Wow okay

456
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,230

 

457
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,200

yeah I do like having the sides open

458
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,210
yeah I do like having the sides open
 

459
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,520
yeah I do like having the sides open
like this so that you can actually watch

460
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,530
like this so that you can actually watch
 

461
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:59,500
like this so that you can actually watch
it that is pretty cool okay so next part

462
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,510
it that is pretty cool okay so next part
 

463
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,010
it that is pretty cool okay so next part
of this we have to actually make some

464
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,020
of this we have to actually make some
 

465
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,510
of this we have to actually make some
way of funneling them into a water

466
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:04,520
way of funneling them into a water
 

467
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,850
way of funneling them into a water
stream so

468
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:06,860
stream so
 

469
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,100
stream so
oh yeah and since we're doing it down in

470
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,110
oh yeah and since we're doing it down in
 

471
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,140
oh yeah and since we're doing it down in
the hole here we'll probably later spend

472
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,150
the hole here we'll probably later spend
 

473
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,300
the hole here we'll probably later spend
time decorating the sides here with the

474
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,310
time decorating the sides here with the
 

475
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,180
time decorating the sides here with the
prismarine blocks and and maybe putting

476
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,190
prismarine blocks and and maybe putting
 

477
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,770
prismarine blocks and and maybe putting
some on the aquarium too just so it's

478
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:17,780
some on the aquarium too just so it's
 

479
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,870
some on the aquarium too just so it's
not a giant thing a glass everywhere oh

480
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:21,880
not a giant thing a glass everywhere oh
 

481
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,940
not a giant thing a glass everywhere oh
man so let me show you my idea oh hey oh

482
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:27,950
man so let me show you my idea oh hey oh
 

483
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,670
man so let me show you my idea oh hey oh
hey no run they're getting out there

484
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
hey no run they're getting out there
 

485
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,240
hey no run they're getting out there
getting out guys yeah I'm gonna show you

486
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,250
getting out guys yeah I'm gonna show you
 

487
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,490
getting out guys yeah I'm gonna show you
guys now my idea of how we're gonna do

488
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:39,500
guys now my idea of how we're gonna do
 

489
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,460
guys now my idea of how we're gonna do
the water streams and stuff why are they

490
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,470
the water streams and stuff why are they
 

491
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,720
the water streams and stuff why are they
all going to that spot oh hey wait wait

492
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:49,730
all going to that spot oh hey wait wait
 

493
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,270
all going to that spot oh hey wait wait
one second one second I just hit one of

494
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,280
one second one second I just hit one of
 

495
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,579
one second one second I just hit one of
these guys with my sword and in this

496
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:54,589
these guys with my sword and in this
 

497
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,930
these guys with my sword and in this
snapshot something has changed

498
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:57,940

 

499
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,329

they take fire damage now they didn't

500
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:01,339
they take fire damage now they didn't
 

501
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,450
they take fire damage now they didn't
before so that means you can kill him

502
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:04,460
before so that means you can kill him
 

503
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,310
before so that means you can kill him
with lava probably okay so here's what I

504
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,320
with lava probably okay so here's what I
 

505
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,579
with lava probably okay so here's what I
want to try out guys

506
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:11,589
want to try out guys
 

507
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,560
want to try out guys
instead of like doing a whole thing of

508
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:14,570
instead of like doing a whole thing of
 

509
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,540
instead of like doing a whole thing of
signs along the bottom of this that they

510
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,550
signs along the bottom of this that they
 

511
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,670
signs along the bottom of this that they
fall through or like fence gates at the

512
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:18,680
fall through or like fence gates at the
 

513
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,760
fall through or like fence gates at the
very bottom we're gonna try put Reed's

514
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:21,770
very bottom we're gonna try put Reed's
 

515
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,000
very bottom we're gonna try put Reed's
going vertically and I don't know if

516
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,010
going vertically and I don't know if
 

517
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,050
going vertically and I don't know if
that's gonna be any good we will see the

518
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,060
that's gonna be any good we will see the
 

519
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,750
that's gonna be any good we will see the
reason for this is like if we were to do

520
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
reason for this is like if we were to do
 

521
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,960
reason for this is like if we were to do
it at a water temple and cover like the

522
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:34,970
it at a water temple and cover like the
 

523
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,070
it at a water temple and cover like the
full 64 by 64 it would be so much easier

524
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,080
full 64 by 64 it would be so much easier
 

525
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,560
full 64 by 64 it would be so much easier
to do it using Reed's I kinda want to

526
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,570
to do it using Reed's I kinda want to
 

527
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,430
to do it using Reed's I kinda want to
just test out the idea compared to using

528
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
just test out the idea compared to using
 

529
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,110
just test out the idea compared to using
fence gates at the bottom because you

530
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
fence gates at the bottom because you
 

531
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,090
fence gates at the bottom because you
got to harvest all the wood and then you

532
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,100
got to harvest all the wood and then you
 

533
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,680
got to harvest all the wood and then you
got to place them and you can't place

534
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:50,690
got to place them and you can't place
 

535
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,870
got to place them and you can't place
them unless you put a block below and

536
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
them unless you put a block below and
 

537
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,380
them unless you put a block below and
you know how it goes so for a more

538
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,390
you know how it goes so for a more
 

539
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,670
you know how it goes so for a more
survival friendly

540
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
survival friendly
 

541
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,960
survival friendly
approach I want to try this read idea

542
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:01,970
approach I want to try this read idea
 

543
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,670
approach I want to try this read idea
cuz reads are really easy to get and

544
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
cuz reads are really easy to get and
 

545
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,910
cuz reads are really easy to get and
they're easy to place might be a bit

546
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:06,920
they're easy to place might be a bit
 

547
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,260
they're easy to place might be a bit
tricky to place them with those guys in

548
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,270
tricky to place them with those guys in
 

549
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,320
tricky to place them with those guys in
the tank we will see I brought some

550
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,330
the tank we will see I brought some
 

551
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,910
the tank we will see I brought some
invisibility potions I don't know if

552
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
invisibility potions I don't know if
 

553
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
invisibility potions I don't know if
they help at all

554
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,450
they help at all
 

555
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,889
they help at all
but we will try them got regen

556
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:20,899
but we will try them got regen
 

557
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:25,990
but we will try them got regen
night-vision all that stuff to you okay

558
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
night-vision all that stuff to you okay
 

559
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,730
night-vision all that stuff to you okay
so you would have like a back wall here

560
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:27,740
so you would have like a back wall here
 

561
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,710
so you would have like a back wall here
and then this one this water on this

562
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
and then this one this water on this
 

563
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,949
and then this one this water on this
side we're gonna make it travel eight

564
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:35,959
side we're gonna make it travel eight
 

565
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,880
side we're gonna make it travel eight
blocks this way

566
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:36,890
blocks this way
 

567
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,650
blocks this way
and it's gonna bring them towards the

568
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:38,660
and it's gonna bring them towards the
 

569
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,420
and it's gonna bring them towards the
middle and the dirt we're standing on is

570
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,430
middle and the dirt we're standing on is
 

571
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,730
middle and the dirt we're standing on is
where the reeds go so basically they'll

572
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:48,740
where the reeds go so basically they'll
 

573
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,160
where the reeds go so basically they'll
fall down through the reeds land on the

574
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,170
fall down through the reeds land on the
 

575
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,990
fall down through the reeds land on the
dirt and since they bounce around a lot

576
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,000
dirt and since they bounce around a lot
 

577
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,579
dirt and since they bounce around a lot
they'll bounce into this water and then

578
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:54,589
they'll bounce into this water and then
 

579
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,350
they'll bounce into this water and then
they'll get carried to the middle is

580
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360
they'll get carried to the middle is
 

581
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,960
they'll get carried to the middle is
what I'm trying to achieve and we will

582
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:58,970
what I'm trying to achieve and we will
 

583
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,579
what I'm trying to achieve and we will
see what happens with that actually this

584
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:03,589
see what happens with that actually this
 

585
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,650
see what happens with that actually this
is probably fine as it is we can get

586
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:05,660
is probably fine as it is we can get
 

587
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,690
is probably fine as it is we can get
going on this so you need water on both

588
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:07,700
going on this so you need water on both
 

589
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,130
going on this so you need water on both
sides for the reeds because they need

590
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,140
sides for the reeds because they need
 

591
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,410
sides for the reeds because they need
water to be planted right reeds hold

592
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:14,420
water to be planted right reeds hold
 

593
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,660
water to be planted right reeds hold
water up so this potentially could work

594
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:19,670
water up so this potentially could work
 

595
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,030
water up so this potentially could work
out pretty good

596
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
out pretty good
 

597
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,210
out pretty good
let's get our stuff going do that one

598
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,220
let's get our stuff going do that one
 

599
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,560
let's get our stuff going do that one
visibility you might have to take the

600
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,570
visibility you might have to take the
 

601
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,019
visibility you might have to take the
armor off I'm not sure I've never

602
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:32,029
armor off I'm not sure I've never
 

603
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,730
armor off I'm not sure I've never
actually used it to try dodge mobs

604
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:33,740
actually used it to try dodge mobs
 

605
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,920
actually used it to try dodge mobs
before because I kind of heard it

606
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:35,930
before because I kind of heard it
 

607
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,810
before because I kind of heard it
doesn't work but I'm not sure exactly

608
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:39,820
doesn't work but I'm not sure exactly
 

609
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,870
doesn't work but I'm not sure exactly
let's see can we if we do that that's

610
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:43,880
let's see can we if we do that that's
 

611
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,490
let's see can we if we do that that's
fine yeah

612
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:49,500
fine yeah
 

613
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,050
fine yeah
would be easier to do it from inside the

614
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,060
would be easier to do it from inside the
 

615
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,470
would be easier to do it from inside the
tank

616
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
tank
 

617
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,230
tank
but just get going here oh hey where'd

618
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,240
but just get going here oh hey where'd
 

619
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,620
but just get going here oh hey where'd
he go

620
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:55,630
he go
 

621
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,650
he go
oh no he sees me he sees me maybe we'll

622
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:58,660
oh no he sees me he sees me maybe we'll
 

623
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,660
oh no he sees me he sees me maybe we'll
use him as a test if we take this off

624
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:02,670

 

625
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,700

hey guy oh oh my goodness it does work

626
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,710
hey guy oh oh my goodness it does work
 

627
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,630
hey guy oh oh my goodness it does work
unless you get really close I'm guessing

628
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:11,640
unless you get really close I'm guessing
 

629
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,470
unless you get really close I'm guessing
like if he touches you oh no it does

630
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
like if he touches you oh no it does
 

631
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,650
like if he touches you oh no it does
totally work that's awesome okay that's

632
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:19,660
totally work that's awesome okay that's
 

633
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,370
totally work that's awesome okay that's
gonna make this easy very easy

634
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,380
gonna make this easy very easy
 

635
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,370
gonna make this easy very easy

that's gonna be an issue I should have
 

655
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,090
that's gonna be an issue I should have
brought water breathing potions although

656

brought water breathing potions although
 

657
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,980

if I have the reeds here I can just put

658
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:10,990
if I have the reeds here I can just put
 

659
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,520
if I have the reeds here I can just put
my head and then every so often to you

660

my head and then every so often to you
 

661
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,260
my head and then every so often to you
but yeah the idea is build them up all

662
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,270
but yeah the idea is build them up all
 

663
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,419
but yeah the idea is build them up all
the way to the top then when they pass

664
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:18,429
the way to the top then when they pass
 

665
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,309
the way to the top then when they pass
through them they'll fall through into

666
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
through them they'll fall through into
 

667
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,900
through them they'll fall through into
our collection area down below so I'm

668
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:24,910
our collection area down below so I'm
 

669
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,579
our collection area down below so I'm
gonna do that with a few of these rows

670
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:26,589
gonna do that with a few of these rows
 

671
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,740
gonna do that with a few of these rows
or at least one row and just kind of

672
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,750
or at least one row and just kind of
 

673
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,720
or at least one row and just kind of
watch it for a bit

674
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,730
watch it for a bit
 

675
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,180
watch it for a bit
am I gonna be able to get out yeah okay

note this is how you do the reeds

682
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:42,760
note this is how you do the reeds
 

683
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,820
note this is how you do the reeds
you gotta place a big column of read

684
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:44,830
you gotta place a big column of read
 

685
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,430
you gotta place a big column of read
somewhere this is pretty efficient

686
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
somewhere this is pretty efficient
 

687
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,960
somewhere this is pretty efficient
there's a lot of reeds maybe this isn't

688
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:51,970
there's a lot of reeds maybe this isn't
 

689
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,030
there's a lot of reeds maybe this isn't
quicker than placing signs I'm not sure

690
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,040
quicker than placing signs I'm not sure
 

691
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,840
quicker than placing signs I'm not sure
it does take it takes a lot of reeds

692
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:57,850
it does take it takes a lot of reeds
 

693
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,790
it does take it takes a lot of reeds
that's all I gotta say this is little

694
00:17:59,790 --> 00:17:59,800
that's all I gotta say this is little
 

695
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,910
that's all I gotta say this is little
this is a time just for one of these

696
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:02,920
this is a time just for one of these
 

697
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,410
this is a time just for one of these
and in total I'm gonna do two or three

698
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:06,420
and in total I'm gonna do two or three
 

699
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,840
and in total I'm gonna do two or three
seems to work pretty decent though I've

700
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:09,850
seems to work pretty decent though I've
 

701
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,610
seems to work pretty decent though I've
been here a while but all of them have

702
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:11,620
been here a while but all of them have
 

703
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,660
been here a while but all of them have
pretty much fallen through all right

704
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:15,670
pretty much fallen through all right
 

705
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,910
pretty much fallen through all right
guys I got a whole column of reads

706
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:17,920
guys I got a whole column of reads
 

707
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
guys I got a whole column of reads
placed we're gonna go run there as quick

708
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:19,930
placed we're gonna go run there as quick
 

709
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,340
placed we're gonna go run there as quick
as we can here to see if we can catch it

710
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,350
as we can here to see if we can catch it
 

711
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,340
as we can here to see if we can catch it
in action see if it's any good or not

712
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,350

 

713
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,510

all right it's just starting they're

714
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,520
all right it's just starting they're
 

715
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,870
all right it's just starting they're
just starting to spawn it looks like got

716
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:33,880
just starting to spawn it looks like got
 

717
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,070
just starting to spawn it looks like got
a few through already most of them have

718
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
a few through already most of them have
 

719
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:46,320
a few through already most of them have
hit the bottom though mm-hmm it did

720
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,330
hit the bottom though mm-hmm it did
 

721
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,120
hit the bottom though mm-hmm it did
actually take longer to place the reason

722
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,130
actually take longer to place the reason
 

723
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,830
actually take longer to place the reason
I thought it would - it's a lot of

724
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
I thought it would - it's a lot of
 

725
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,120
I thought it would - it's a lot of
blocks

726
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,130

 

727
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,770

although see the thing is some of them

728
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:01,780
although see the thing is some of them
 

729
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,480
although see the thing is some of them
are swimming around up there so if we

730
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,490
are swimming around up there so if we
 

731
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,300
are swimming around up there so if we
just put signs at the bottom here they

732
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,310
just put signs at the bottom here they
 

733
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,710
just put signs at the bottom here they
would they wouldn't really do anything

734
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:09,720
would they wouldn't really do anything
 

735
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,270
would they wouldn't really do anything
for those ones up there it only would

736
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,280
for those ones up there it only would
 

737
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,790
for those ones up there it only would
work on the bottom dwellers hmm all

738
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:17,800
work on the bottom dwellers hmm all
 

739
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,940
work on the bottom dwellers hmm all
right well I guess I could do both yeah

740
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:20,950
right well I guess I could do both yeah
 

741
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,740
right well I guess I could do both yeah
let's do both so I'm gonna change out

742
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:22,750
let's do both so I'm gonna change out
 

743
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,770
let's do both so I'm gonna change out
this glass here with signs we're gonna

744
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:25,780
this glass here with signs we're gonna
 

745
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,060
this glass here with signs we're gonna
leave these recons

746
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,070
leave these recons
 

747
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,870
leave these recons
at the two ends I guess and that should

748
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
at the two ends I guess and that should
 

749
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,420
at the two ends I guess and that should
work pretty effectively

750
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,430

 

751
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,120

so modifications have been made and it

752
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,130
so modifications have been made and it
 

753
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,210
so modifications have been made and it
is turning out pretty cool let's go down

754
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,220
is turning out pretty cool let's go down
 

755
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,420
is turning out pretty cool let's go down
and take a look it seems to work pretty

756
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,430
and take a look it seems to work pretty
 

757
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,320
and take a look it seems to work pretty
good have a lot of adjustments to make

758
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,330
good have a lot of adjustments to make
 

759
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,970
good have a lot of adjustments to make
to it yet though so it's not even close

760
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:50,980
to it yet though so it's not even close
 

761
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,900
to it yet though so it's not even close
to finished or anything but you can see

762
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:54,910
to finished or anything but you can see
 

763
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,050
to finished or anything but you can see
I got the fence gates all over there and

764
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,060
I got the fence gates all over there and
 

765
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,530
I got the fence gates all over there and
they fall down through that if they are

766
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:01,540
they fall down through that if they are
 

767
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,350
they fall down through that if they are
swimming around up top usually they will

768
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,360
swimming around up top usually they will
 

769
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,230
swimming around up top usually they will
swim through the reeds and they'll fall

770
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,240
swim through the reeds and they'll fall
 

771
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,760
swim through the reeds and they'll fall
down quickly like you just saw there and

772
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:11,770
down quickly like you just saw there and
 

773
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,350
down quickly like you just saw there and
here's here's an issue I'm seeing it

774
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:14,360
here's here's an issue I'm seeing it
 

775
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,760
here's here's an issue I'm seeing it
when they get to the edge of the water

776
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:15,770
when they get to the edge of the water
 

777
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,610
when they get to the edge of the water
stream they they hop like that always

778
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:20,620
stream they they hop like that always
 

779
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,050
stream they they hop like that always
it's like one of the things that they're

780
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,060
it's like one of the things that they're
 

781
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,370
it's like one of the things that they're
programmed to do I guess

782
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:24,380
programmed to do I guess
 

783
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,290
programmed to do I guess
so I'll have to deal with that somehow

784
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,300
so I'll have to deal with that somehow
 

785
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
so I'll have to deal with that somehow
but I got them all funneling towards the

786
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,710
but I got them all funneling towards the
 

787
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,390
but I got them all funneling towards the
middle right now and if we go that guy's

788
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:37,400
middle right now and if we go that guy's
 

789
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,840
middle right now and if we go that guy's
falling down very slowly if we go down

790
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:40,850
falling down very slowly if we go down
 

791
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,970
falling down very slowly if we go down
these stairs get ready for this the the

792
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:45,980
these stairs get ready for this the the
 

793
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,210
these stairs get ready for this the the
Guardian particle accelerator is in the

794
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,220
Guardian particle accelerator is in the
 

795
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:57,760
Guardian particle accelerator is in the
works oh yeah not exactly sure what I

796

want to do with this yet but it's a
 

799
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,900
want to do with this yet but it's a
mechanic that just seems like so much

800
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:01,910
mechanic that just seems like so much
 

801
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,030

fun we have to do something so if you
 

803
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,070
fun we have to do something so if you
don't know this since these guys hop

804
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,080
don't know this since these guys hop
 

805
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,300
don't know this since these guys hop
around a lot for some reason if they if

806
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,310
around a lot for some reason if they if
 

807
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,850

they're on slime blocks they just get

808
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:15,860
they're on slime blocks they just get
 

809
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,380
they're on slime blocks they just get
crazy air time like they fly how many

810
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,390
crazy air time like they fly how many
 

811
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,260
crazy air time like they fly how many
blocks is it three four five six seven

812
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,270
blocks is it three four five six seven
 

813
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,720
blocks is it three four five six seven
eight I cannot even count them from the

814
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:25,730
eight I cannot even count them from the
 

815
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:38,800
eight I cannot even count them from the
bottom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:38,810
bottom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
 

817
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,130
bottom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
15 15 to 16 ish I would say it's pretty

818
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,140
15 15 to 16 ish I would say it's pretty
 

819
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,880
15 15 to 16 ish I would say it's pretty
cool

820
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:45,890
cool
 

821
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,190
cool
and though this bounce and bounce that

822
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,200
and though this bounce and bounce that
 

823
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,170
and though this bounce and bounce that
is not pistons launching them up that's

824
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,180
is not pistons launching them up that's
 

825
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,630
is not pistons launching them up that's
just them on on the slime blocks and

826
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
just them on on the slime blocks and
 

827
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,000
just them on on the slime blocks and
they do that even if you don't drop them

828
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,010
they do that even if you don't drop them
 

829
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,370
they do that even if you don't drop them
on the slime block so just bounce their

830
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:57,380
on the slime block so just bounce their
 

831
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,810
on the slime block so just bounce their
way up and get higher and higher until

832
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:58,820
way up and get higher and higher until
 

833
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,230
way up and get higher and higher until
they reach maximum height like this so

834
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
they reach maximum height like this so
 

835
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,950
they reach maximum height like this so
that's pretty cool we need to add a

836
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:05,960
that's pretty cool we need to add a
 

837
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,860
that's pretty cool we need to add a
killing thing for this and the portal

838
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:08,870
killing thing for this and the portal
 

839
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,270
killing thing for this and the portal
thing to bring them to the nether in

840
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,280
thing to bring them to the nether in
 

841
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,690
thing to bring them to the nether in
case we want to have some fun with that

842
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:12,700
case we want to have some fun with that
 

843
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,710
case we want to have some fun with that

844
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
you can see they're bouncing around the
 

845
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,120
you can see they're bouncing around the
top there they're having trouble falling

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:31,910
we're getting lots of ink sacs as well
 

857
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,520
we're getting lots of ink sacs as well
even though a lot of them fall on the

858
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,530
even though a lot of them fall on the
 

859
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,560
even though a lot of them fall on the
reads a bunch of them fall down here and

860
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:37,570
reads a bunch of them fall down here and
 

861
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,910
reads a bunch of them fall down here and

kind of sad about that because that
 

909
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,250
kind of sad about that because that
would be a cool way to get player heads

would be a cool way to get player heads
 

911
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,120
