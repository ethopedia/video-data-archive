affected but I think everybody's being
 

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,389
affected but I think everybody's being
affected by that in the snapshots that

28
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399
affected by that in the snapshots that
 

29
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,540
affected by that in the snapshots that
noise I'm talking about of course so

worked on this boat target game I wanted
to get that done today so we could try

36
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,160
to get that done today so we could try
 

37
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,750
to get that done today so we could try
it out

38
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
it out
 

39
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,190
it out

00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
but this boat target game um yeah it's
 

41
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,679
but this boat target game um yeah it's
not going to happen

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:08,689
not going to happen
 

43
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:14,929
not going to happen

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,110
blocks don't there goes that arrow it
 

47
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,350
blocks don't there goes that arrow it
almost cleared the whole thing with that

48
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,360
almost cleared the whole thing with that
 

49
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,929
almost cleared the whole thing with that
yeah so it turns out I went into

50
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:23,939
yeah so it turns out I went into
 

51
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,090
yeah so it turns out I went into
creative for a moment to see how

52
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,100
creative for a moment to see how
 

53
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,980
creative for a moment to see how
difficult it is to actually hit a

54
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,990
difficult it is to actually hit a
 

55
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,300
difficult it is to actually hit a
falling boats with a bow and arrow and

56
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,310
falling boats with a bow and arrow and
 

57
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,520
falling boats with a bow and arrow and
it's pretty difficult but not too

58
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,530
it's pretty difficult but not too
 

59
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,100
it's pretty difficult but not too
difficult I think it was actually about

60
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,110
difficult I think it was actually about
 

61
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,450
difficult I think it was actually about
right it falls pretty quickly um the big

62
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,460
right it falls pretty quickly um the big
 

63
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,420
right it falls pretty quickly um the big
problem though quite cheap let's say you

64
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,430
problem though quite cheap let's say you
 

65
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,670
problem though quite cheap let's say you
got a boat over there um so to hit it

66
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:52,680
got a boat over there um so to hit it
 

67
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,950
got a boat over there um so to hit it
you would shoot about there right but

68
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
you would shoot about there right but
 

69
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,620
you would shoot about there right but
there's a bug in the game I don't know

70
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,630
there's a bug in the game I don't know
 

71
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,670
there's a bug in the game I don't know
if it's a snapshot bug eye or what but

72
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:00,680
if it's a snapshot bug eye or what but
 

73
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,130
if it's a snapshot bug eye or what but
the boat is visually below where it

74
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
the boat is visually below where it
 

75
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,319
the boat is visually below where it
appears to be as it's falling so in

76
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,329
appears to be as it's falling so in
 

77
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,210
appears to be as it's falling so in
order to hit a boat that appears to be

78
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,220
order to hit a boat that appears to be
 

79
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,190
order to hit a boat that appears to be
at that height I would have to shoot

80
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
at that height I would have to shoot
 

81
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,800
at that height I would have to shoot
like over here

82
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:11,810
like over here
 

83
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,660
like over here
is what I found out so that's not going

84
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:14,670
is what I found out so that's not going
 

85
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,780
is what I found out so that's not going
to work out too well yeah as it's

86
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:20,790
to work out too well yeah as it's
 

87
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,030
to work out too well yeah as it's
falling only not when it's stationary of

88
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
falling only not when it's stationary of
 

89
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,119
falling only not when it's stationary of
course so instead we're going to do a

90
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:26,129
course so instead we're going to do a
 

91
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,880
course so instead we're going to do a
chicken target shooting game I still

92
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,890
chicken target shooting game I still
 

93
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,149
chicken target shooting game I still
want to do a target game so I started

94
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:32,159
want to do a target game so I started
 

95
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,190
want to do a target game so I started
setting that up at the Mantid let's go

96
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
setting that up at the Mantid let's go
 

97
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,720
setting that up at the Mantid let's go
check it out okay so I decided to put it

98
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:41,730
check it out okay so I decided to put it
 

99
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,390
check it out okay so I decided to put it
over in this area where we have the vine

100
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
over in this area where we have the vine
 

101
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,699
over in this area where we have the vine
farm I want to expand out further this

102
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:46,709
farm I want to expand out further this
 

103
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,390
farm I want to expand out further this
way as as we build more things well this

104
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
way as as we build more things well this
 

105
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,690
way as as we build more things well this
is one of the places I want to build so

106
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:53,700
is one of the places I want to build so
 

107
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,160
is one of the places I want to build so
I don't have a lot set up to it and we

108
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,170
I don't have a lot set up to it and we
 

109
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,809
I don't have a lot set up to it and we
won't be able to do much we're going to

110
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:56,819
won't be able to do much we're going to
 

111
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,670
won't be able to do much we're going to
do other things today but I just want to

112
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:58,680
do other things today but I just want to

show you what I did
we're going to have dispensers these

116
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:02,549
we're going to have dispensers these
 

117
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,360
we're going to have dispensers these
will be full of chicken eggs and I got

118
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,370
will be full of chicken eggs and I got
 

119
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,000
will be full of chicken eggs and I got
an egg delivery system up here we got

120
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,010
an egg delivery system up here we got
 

121
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,149
an egg delivery system up here we got
hoppers and then a chain of hoppers

122
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,159
hoppers and then a chain of hoppers
 

123
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,780
hoppers and then a chain of hoppers
going this way and there's gonna be a

124
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:14,790
going this way and there's gonna be a
 

125
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,939
going this way and there's gonna be a
big buffer of chicken eggs in these

126
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:16,949
big buffer of chicken eggs in these
 

127
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:22,670
big buffer of chicken eggs in these
chests and these are our chickens so the

128
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
chests and these are our chickens so the
 

129
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
chests and these are our chickens so the
reason I didn't want to do a chicken

130
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:23,970
reason I didn't want to do a chicken
 

131
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,550
reason I didn't want to do a chicken
target game is because it's gonna take

132
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,560
target game is because it's gonna take
 

133
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,670
target game is because it's gonna take
forever to get the eggs to actually try

134
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680
forever to get the eggs to actually try
 

135
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,479
forever to get the eggs to actually try
this out um so that's why we can't do it

136
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,489
this out um so that's why we can't do it
 

137
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,309
this out um so that's why we can't do it
today it's going to take hours and hours

138
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
today it's going to take hours and hours
 

139
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,210
today it's going to take hours and hours
to get enough eggs but those chickens

140
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,220
to get enough eggs but those chickens
 

141
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,319
to get enough eggs but those chickens
will grow up and they'll start laying

142
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,329
will grow up and they'll start laying
 

143
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,640
will grow up and they'll start laying
eggs

144
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:40,650
eggs
 

145
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,920
eggs
chickens are pretty easy to shoot as

146
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:42,930
chickens are pretty easy to shoot as
 

147
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,550
chickens are pretty easy to shoot as
they're falling actually so we don't

148
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
they're falling actually so we don't
 

149
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
they're falling actually so we don't
need a lot of vertical height I don't

150
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,090
need a lot of vertical height I don't
 

151
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,300
need a lot of vertical height I don't
think and I did in this area where I can

152
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,310
think and I did in this area where I can
 

153
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,520
think and I did in this area where I can
actually back up quite a bit because

154
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,530
actually back up quite a bit because
 

155
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,229
actually back up quite a bit because
they're going to be falling along that

156
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
they're going to be falling along that
 

157
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,199
they're going to be falling along that
wall there so to make it more difficult

158
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,209
wall there so to make it more difficult
 

159
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,099
wall there so to make it more difficult
there's not going to be much vertical

160
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:01,109
there's not going to be much vertical
 

161
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,899
there's not going to be much vertical
height to shoot them in and also I can

162
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:02,909
height to shoot them in and also I can
 

163
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,000
height to shoot them in and also I can
back up quite a ways if I wanted it to

164
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,010
back up quite a ways if I wanted it to
 

165
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,129
back up quite a ways if I wanted it to
be more difficult to hit them with the

166
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:07,139
be more difficult to hit them with the
 

167
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,119
be more difficult to hit them with the
bow and arrow so that'll be good and you

168
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,129
bow and arrow so that'll be good and you
 

169
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,339
bow and arrow so that'll be good and you
know I actually do need a chicken farm I

170
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:13,349
know I actually do need a chicken farm I
 

171
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,159
know I actually do need a chicken farm I
don't have one in my world yet so I

172
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,169
don't have one in my world yet so I
 

173
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,149
don't have one in my world yet so I
think we're gonna also get some way of

174
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,159
think we're gonna also get some way of
 

175
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,700
think we're gonna also get some way of
harvesting chickens out of this do maybe

176
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:22,710
harvesting chickens out of this do maybe
 

177
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,790
harvesting chickens out of this do maybe

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:27,960
back later in the game spoiler alert I
 

219
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,740
back later in the game spoiler alert I
basically want to make a pile of my my

220
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:30,750
basically want to make a pile of my my
 

221
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,170
basically want to make a pile of my my
ores here like a pile of emeralds and

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:37,590
stuff instead of keeping it in this
 

227
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,719
stuff instead of keeping it in this
chest that you can visually see how much

228
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:41,729
chest that you can visually see how much
 

229
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,760

stuff I got playing my world here so
 

231
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,100
stuff I got playing my world here so
yeah we're basically just making a giant

232
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,110
yeah we're basically just making a giant
 

233
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,480
yeah we're basically just making a giant
cave where is that and I'm lost my own

234
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,490
cave where is that and I'm lost my own
 

235
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,950
cave where is that and I'm lost my own
place here over here um and I scouted

236
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:57,960
place here over here um and I scouted
 

237
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,769
place here over here um and I scouted
around a bit this is the slime farm over

238
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:00,779
around a bit this is the slime farm over
 

239
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,740
around a bit this is the slime farm over
here apparently as usual there is so

240
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:03,750
here apparently as usual there is so
 

241
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,249
here apparently as usual there is so
much junk around underground I have to

242
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:07,259
much junk around underground I have to
 

243
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,980
much junk around underground I have to
be very careful where I dig out so we

244
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:09,990
be very careful where I dig out so we
 

245
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,779
be very careful where I dig out so we
can't go that way we're going to have to

246
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:11,789
can't go that way we're going to have to
 

247
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,200
can't go that way we're going to have to
make the entrance to it like something

248
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,210
make the entrance to it like something
 

249
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,149
make the entrance to it like something
like this going this way and then we hit

250
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:20,159
like this going this way and then we hit
 

251
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,980
like this going this way and then we hit
something else here this is from the

252
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:21,990
something else here this is from the
 

253
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,909
something else here this is from the
mushroom farm

254
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:22,919
mushroom farm
 

255
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,089
mushroom farm
so we'll try make it come up two or

256
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:26,099
so we'll try make it come up two or
 

257
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,689
so we'll try make it come up two or
three blocks so we avoid that we might

258
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:28,699
three blocks so we avoid that we might
 

259
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,730
three blocks so we avoid that we might
accidentally destroy it here though I'm

260
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
accidentally destroy it here though I'm
 

261
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,769
accidentally destroy it here though I'm
not too sure what's going to happen

262
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:35,779
not too sure what's going to happen
 

263
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,700
not too sure what's going to happen
hopefully

264
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:37,710
hopefully
 

265
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:48,590
hopefully
things go okay though um yeah that did

266
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:48,600
things go okay though um yeah that did
 

267
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,029
things go okay though um yeah that did
not come as far down as I thought it

268
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
not come as far down as I thought it
 

269
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,920
not come as far down as I thought it
would I guess that's good all right so

270
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:54,930
would I guess that's good all right so
 

271
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,610
would I guess that's good all right so
we might need a few more TNT here but we

272
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:58,620
we might need a few more TNT here but we
 

273
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,659
we might need a few more TNT here but we
got our cave our room did it we didn't

274
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:02,669
got our cave our room did it we didn't
 

275
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,680
got our cave our room did it we didn't
destroy anything I am surprised there's

276
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,690
destroy anything I am surprised there's
 

277
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,140
destroy anything I am surprised there's
a cave here oh okay this is by the river

278
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,150
a cave here oh okay this is by the river
 

279
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,879
a cave here oh okay this is by the river
this got closed off I guess yes I think

280
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:16,889
this got closed off I guess yes I think
 

281
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,740
this got closed off I guess yes I think
this dead ends if I remember right yeah

282
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:18,750
this dead ends if I remember right yeah
 

283
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,659
this dead ends if I remember right yeah
so I must have blocked that off before

284
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:20,669
so I must have blocked that off before
 

285
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,420
so I must have blocked that off before
now we've opened up to it again um yeah

286
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,430
now we've opened up to it again um yeah
 

287
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,550
now we've opened up to it again um yeah
that's cool we didn't we didn't destroy

288
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
that's cool we didn't we didn't destroy
 

289
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,710
that's cool we didn't we didn't destroy

we got to go down like three or four
 

293
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,600
we got to go down like three or four
more blocks here yet though okay we're

294
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,610
more blocks here yet though okay we're
 

295
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,490
more blocks here yet though okay we're
going to take a quick break here because

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:40,500
going to take a quick break here because
 

297
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,719
going to take a quick break here because
our nose-picker

298
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:41,729
our nose-picker
 

299
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,810
our nose-picker
is about to break it's about to pick its

300
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:44,820
is about to break it's about to pick its
 

301

five levels doesn't quite repair it all
 

307
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,300

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,020
bad though all right so we got a
nice-sized room blown out here I like it

478
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,030
nice-sized room blown out here I like it
 

479
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,710
nice-sized room blown out here I like it
might need to be bigger we will see how

480
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:07,720
might need to be bigger we will see how
 

481
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,090
might need to be bigger we will see how
this goes

482
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,100
this goes
 

483
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,580
this goes
I've gotta do a lot of polishing of the

484
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:11,590
I've gotta do a lot of polishing of the
 

485
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,940
I've gotta do a lot of polishing of the
walls and and such but I figure we

486
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:14,950
walls and and such but I figure we
 

487
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,520
walls and and such but I figure we
should start decorating it try to figure

488
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,530
should start decorating it try to figure
 

489
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,040
should start decorating it try to figure
out what style we want to go with for

490
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,050
out what style we want to go with for
 

491
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,040
out what style we want to go with for

492
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,050
this room unfortunately I checked around
 

493
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,320
this room unfortunately I checked around
the whole thing is desert biome Oh such

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,330
the whole thing is desert biome Oh such
 

495
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,560
the whole thing is desert biome Oh such
a tragedy so that means if we did a

496
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:31,570
a tragedy so that means if we did a
 

497
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,440
a tragedy so that means if we did a
grass and like tree theme like I have in

498
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,450
grass and like tree theme like I have in
 

499
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,750
grass and like tree theme like I have in
the rest of the cave it's gonna be

500
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:36,760
the rest of the cave it's gonna be
 

501
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,210
the rest of the cave it's gonna be
yellow it I don't like yellow grass

502
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,220
yellow it I don't like yellow grass
 

503
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,080
yellow it I don't like yellow grass
vines will be yellow oh that really

504
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,090
vines will be yellow oh that really
 

505
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,320
vines will be yellow oh that really
stinks I wish it was forest biome I

506
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,330
stinks I wish it was forest biome I
 

507
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,660
stinks I wish it was forest biome I
really like grass and forest biome maybe

508
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:48,670
really like grass and forest biome maybe
 

509
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,990
really like grass and forest biome maybe
even more than jungle to some extent

510
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
even more than jungle to some extent
 

511
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,230
even more than jungle to some extent
it's more it goes better with brown I

512
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:55,240
it's more it goes better with brown I
 

513
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,890
it's more it goes better with brown I
find then the jungle grass jungle grass

514
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:58,900
find then the jungle grass jungle grass
 

515
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,080
find then the jungle grass jungle grass
is more green though so on its own it

516
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,090
is more green though so on its own it
 

517
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,710
is more green though so on its own it
looks better for sure but anyway so I

518
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
looks better for sure but anyway so I
 

519
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,850
looks better for sure but anyway so I
thought I got so much coal I don't I

520
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:08,860
thought I got so much coal I don't I
 

521
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,960
thought I got so much coal I don't I
don't know if I really want to make a

522
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:09,970
don't know if I really want to make a
 

523
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,600
don't know if I really want to make a
coal pile but maybe we will do the floor

524
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:12,610
coal pile but maybe we will do the floor
 

525
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,360
coal pile but maybe we will do the floor
out of coal and see what that looks like

526
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,370
out of coal and see what that looks like
 

527
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,780
out of coal and see what that looks like
so let's let's get it going out that

528
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:18,790
so let's let's get it going out that
 

529
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,730
so let's let's get it going out that
will make the room very dark and that

530
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:20,740
will make the room very dark and that
 

531
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,510
will make the room very dark and that
will make the the gems and that really

532
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:24,520
will make the the gems and that really
 

533
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,250
will make the the gems and that really
stand out if we do it this way the other

534
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,260
stand out if we do it this way the other
 

535
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,620
stand out if we do it this way the other
idea is like if we want to do paths we

536
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:31,630
idea is like if we want to do paths we
 

537
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,230
idea is like if we want to do paths we
could use slime blocks to get green in

538
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
could use slime blocks to get green in
 

539
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,480
could use slime blocks to get green in
here maybe I don't know how does this

540
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,490
here maybe I don't know how does this
 

541
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:45,360
here maybe I don't know how does this
look over gold stone that might be cool

542
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,370
look over gold stone that might be cool
 

543
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,240
look over gold stone that might be cool
and I don't want to put everything on

544
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,250
and I don't want to put everything on
 

545
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,500
and I don't want to put everything on
one big pile

546
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:49,510
one big pile
 

547
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,629
one big pile
think we'll split it up the gold should

548
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:51,639
think we'll split it up the gold should
 

549
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,250
think we'll split it up the gold should
probably go in the middle though like

550
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:53,260
probably go in the middle though like
 

551
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,870
probably go in the middle though like
we'll have a big pile of gold in the

552
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
we'll have a big pile of gold in the
 

553
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,670
we'll have a big pile of gold in the
middle that's what I'm going to get the

554
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:56,680
middle that's what I'm going to get the
 

555
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,110
middle that's what I'm going to get the
most of I suspect but then we'll hide

556
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
most of I suspect but then we'll hide
 

557
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
most of I suspect but then we'll hide
like some up there there's a tape over

558
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:04,089
like some up there there's a tape over
 

559
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,540
like some up there there's a tape over
there we'll hide some you know kind of

560
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:06,550
there we'll hide some you know kind of
 

561
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,060
there we'll hide some you know kind of
spread it out try to make it look cool

562
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,070

 

563
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,210

okay get this going so if we do want a

564
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,220
okay get this going so if we do want a
 

565
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,790
okay get this going so if we do want a
path actually I just would have to start

566
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:17,800
path actually I just would have to start
 

567
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,629
path actually I just would have to start
about here because it comes up we're

568
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:21,639
about here because it comes up we're
 

569
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,370
about here because it comes up we're
going to have stairs I should be careful

570
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:26,380
going to have stairs I should be careful
 

571
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,780
going to have stairs I should be careful
not to lose this cold though it is

572
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:27,790
not to lose this cold though it is
 

573
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,370
not to lose this cold though it is
valuable to some extent

574
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,380
valuable to some extent
 

575
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,750
valuable to some extent
I wonder how annoying it would be to

576
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:33,760
I wonder how annoying it would be to
 

577
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,019
I wonder how annoying it would be to
have a slime bath mmm

578
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,029
have a slime bath mmm
 

579
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,750
have a slime bath mmm
like made it go around the gold pile in

580
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
like made it go around the gold pile in
 

581
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:49,139
like made it go around the gold pile in
the middle it looks pretty weird I'm not

582
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,149
the middle it looks pretty weird I'm not
 

583
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:56,160
the middle it looks pretty weird I'm not
sure about this I've never like built

584
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,170
sure about this I've never like built
 

585
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,350
sure about this I've never like built
with slime blocks before it's so bouncy

586
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
with slime blocks before it's so bouncy
 

587
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,930
with slime blocks before it's so bouncy
I'm not sure if we should do that maybe

588
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:03,940
I'm not sure if we should do that maybe
 

589
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm not sure if we should do that maybe
we should use something else for the

590
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,100
we should use something else for the
 

591
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
we should use something else for the
floor and we'll decorate walls with it

592
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,110
floor and we'll decorate walls with it
 

593
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,400
floor and we'll decorate walls with it
or something instead that could get

594
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,410
or something instead that could get
 

595
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,269
or something instead that could get
annoying to walk on all right anyway

596
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
annoying to walk on all right anyway
 

597
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,509
annoying to walk on all right anyway
let's let's get the coal going there's

598
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:18,519
let's let's get the coal going there's
 

599
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,920
let's let's get the coal going there's
that sound again about the hundreds of

600
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:22,930
that sound again about the hundreds of
 

601
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,579
that sound again about the hundreds of
time I've heard it today today got the

602
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:29,589
time I've heard it today today got the
 

603
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,939
time I've heard it today today got the
coal and I'm gonna get my gold and just

604
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:32,949
coal and I'm gonna get my gold and just
 

605
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,189
coal and I'm gonna get my gold and just
see what it looks like so I'm guessing I

606
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
see what it looks like so I'm guessing I
 

607
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,379
see what it looks like so I'm guessing I
want the pile like right here be the

608
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:37,389
want the pile like right here be the
 

609
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,870
want the pile like right here be the
center so I'm going to go get the gold

610
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:39,880
center so I'm going to go get the gold
 

611
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,480
center so I'm going to go get the gold
we'll put it down yeah so let me know

612
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,490
we'll put it down yeah so let me know
 

613
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,850
we'll put it down yeah so let me know
what you guys think about using coal for

614
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:47,860
what you guys think about using coal for
 

615
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,670
what you guys think about using coal for
the floor if you like it we may even use

616
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:50,680
the floor if you like it we may even use
 

617
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,040
the floor if you like it we may even use
it for the walls and the ceiling I have

618
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,050
it for the walls and the ceiling I have
 

619
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,009
it for the walls and the ceiling I have
I have enough we can do it if we want I

620
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:56,019
I have enough we can do it if we want I
 

621
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,429
I have enough we can do it if we want I
have probably a double chest of coal

622
00:16:59,429 --> 00:16:59,439
have probably a double chest of coal
 

623
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,160
have probably a double chest of coal
blocks at least because I've always used

624
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,170
blocks at least because I've always used
 

625
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,210
blocks at least because I've always used
the

626
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:03,220
the
 

627
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,069
the
blaze rods pretty much for my smelting

628
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,079
blaze rods pretty much for my smelting
 

629
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,220
blaze rods pretty much for my smelting
haven't used my coal for anything really

630
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,230
haven't used my coal for anything really
 

631
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,780

634
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,470
the whole room black we will have
 

635
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,880
the whole room black we will have
glowstone piles for lighting and like

636
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:17,890
glowstone piles for lighting and like
 

637
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,800
glowstone piles for lighting and like
we'll probably have it like running down

638
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:19,810
we'll probably have it like running down
 

639
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,980
we'll probably have it like running down
the walls we might try to a stalagmites

640
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:22,990
the walls we might try to a stalagmites
 

641
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,900
the walls we might try to a stalagmites
and slide tight thing with like slime

642
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:24,910
and slide tight thing with like slime
 

643
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,900
and slide tight thing with like slime
blocks or other other ores so it won't

644
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:27,910
blocks or other other ores so it won't
 

645
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,600
blocks or other other ores so it won't
be totally black everywhere but it would

646
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,610
be totally black everywhere but it would
 

647
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,700
be totally black everywhere but it would
just be like the background color if if

648
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:32,710
just be like the background color if if
 

649
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,760
just be like the background color if if
we do coal otherwise I'll just keep my

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:35,770
we do coal otherwise I'll just keep my
 

651
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,340
we do coal otherwise I'll just keep my
coal in a chest because I don't want to

652
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,350
coal in a chest because I don't want to
 

653
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,790
coal in a chest because I don't want to
make a pile out of it um but I got the

654
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:41,800
make a pile out of it um but I got the
 

655
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,210
make a pile out of it um but I got the
gold

656
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:42,220
gold
 

657
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,910
gold
let's start our gold pile see what it

658
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:44,920
let's start our gold pile see what it
 

659
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,920
let's start our gold pile see what it
looks like try to do a pretty random as

660
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:48,930
looks like try to do a pretty random as
 

661
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:55,410
looks like try to do a pretty random as
I as I make a perfect square maybe have

662
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,420
I as I make a perfect square maybe have
 

663
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,510
I as I make a perfect square maybe have
a few piles and places I don't know

664
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520

 

665
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,220

can't really blocks the door I should I

666
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,230
can't really blocks the door I should I
 

667
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,310
can't really blocks the door I should I
should be careful about that but yeah

668
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
should be careful about that but yeah
 

669
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,020
should be careful about that but yeah
let's try me a big pile in the middle oh

670
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,030
let's try me a big pile in the middle oh
 

671
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,520
let's try me a big pile in the middle oh
yeah

672
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,530
yeah
 

673
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,780
yeah
we're going to get lots more in the

674
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:15,790
we're going to get lots more in the
 

675
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,810
we're going to get lots more in the
future yeah alright so let's try even it

676
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:21,820
future yeah alright so let's try even it
 

677
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,100
future yeah alright so let's try even it
out a bit got to really watch for

678
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,110
out a bit got to really watch for
 

679
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,440
out a bit got to really watch for
creepers I tried to light this room up I

680
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,450
creepers I tried to light this room up I
 

681
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,450
creepers I tried to light this room up I
would be sad if this got blown up I

682
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,460
would be sad if this got blown up I
 

683
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,490
would be sad if this got blown up I
don't really care about the coal or the

684
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:32,500
don't really care about the coal or the
 

685
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,700
don't really care about the coal or the
diamonds or anything but gold and iron

686
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:34,710
diamonds or anything but gold and iron
 

687
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,500
diamonds or anything but gold and iron
kind of a big deal

688
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,510

 

689
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,880

lapis I have lots of lapis I'm

690
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,890
lapis I have lots of lapis I'm
 

691
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,740
lapis I have lots of lapis I'm
considering not putting it in here but

692
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:43,750
considering not putting it in here but
 

693
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,830
considering not putting it in here but
we will see we probably should actually

694
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
we will see we probably should actually
 

695
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
we will see we probably should actually
because it's it's sort of valuable and

696
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,290
because it's it's sort of valuable and
 

697
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,140
because it's it's sort of valuable and
it's kind of fill up the room pretty

698
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,150
it's kind of fill up the room pretty
 

699
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,870
it's kind of fill up the room pretty
quick here just with what I had not even

700
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
quick here just with what I had not even
 

701
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,890
quick here just with what I had not even
counting what I'm going to get in the

702
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:58,900
counting what I'm going to get in the
 

703
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:08,000
counting what I'm going to get in the
future alright pretty good looking pile

704
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,010

 

705
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,519

what's that look like so far

706
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:11,529
what's that look like so far
 

707
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:15,039
what's that look like so far
that's not bad it's a little too

708
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,049
that's not bad it's a little too
 

709
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,379
that's not bad it's a little too
vertical I think it should be wider at

710
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:17,389
vertical I think it should be wider at
 

711
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:27,909
vertical I think it should be wider at
the base that's fine all right so that's

712
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
the base that's fine all right so that's
 

713
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,430
the base that's fine all right so that's
our gold pile and as I use it up I'll

714
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:30,440
our gold pile and as I use it up I'll
 

715
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,169
our gold pile and as I use it up I'll
take away from the pile if I get more

716
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:32,179
take away from the pile if I get more
 

717
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,329
take away from the pile if I get more
I'll add to it sort of thing um let's

718
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:37,339
I'll add to it sort of thing um let's
 

719
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:47,919
I'll add to it sort of thing um let's
take a look again yeah cool okay then so

720
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:47,929
take a look again yeah cool okay then so
 

721
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,079
take a look again yeah cool okay then so
you know all that stuff I said about the

722
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,089
you know all that stuff I said about the
 

723
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,059
you know all that stuff I said about the
coal how we might do it and and do this

724
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:52,069
coal how we might do it and and do this
 

725
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:52,809
coal how we might do it and and do this
and do that

726
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:52,819
and do that
 

727
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:55,180
and do that
forget about it we're not doing the coal

728
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,190
forget about it we're not doing the coal
 

729
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,099
forget about it we're not doing the coal
I spent some time in that room and I got

730
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,109
I spent some time in that room and I got
 

731
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,649
I spent some time in that room and I got
sick of it very quick and I checked the

732
00:19:59,649 --> 00:19:59,659
sick of it very quick and I checked the
 

733
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,139
sick of it very quick and I checked the
video and it looked really dark so I

734
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:02,149
video and it looked really dark so I
 

735
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,169
video and it looked really dark so I
don't think long term it's a good idea

736
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:04,179
don't think long term it's a good idea
 

737
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,180
don't think long term it's a good idea
so I decide just to try the grass and

738
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,190
so I decide just to try the grass and
 

739
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,829
so I decide just to try the grass and
it's it's not that bad actually

740
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:08,839
it's it's not that bad actually
 

741
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,189
it's it's not that bad actually
um so let's go check it out I did a an

742
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:12,199
um so let's go check it out I did a an
 

743
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:18,129
um so let's go check it out I did a an
arch over here now um this tree used to

744
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:18,139
arch over here now um this tree used to
 

745
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:21,669
arch over here now um this tree used to
be over here the the logs and I move

746
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
be over here the the logs and I move
 

747
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,409
be over here the the logs and I move
them over make it look like an offset

748
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:23,419
them over make it look like an offset
 

749
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,919
them over make it look like an offset
tree just so we can walk by easier um

750
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:26,929
tree just so we can walk by easier um
 

751
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:30,819
tree just so we can walk by easier um
got some stairs going on here and flower

752
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:30,829
got some stairs going on here and flower
 

753
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,119
got some stairs going on here and flower
pots and stuff I don't have any of the

754
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,129
pots and stuff I don't have any of the
 

755
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,919
pots and stuff I don't have any of the
new flowers really I guess I never

756
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:35,929
new flowers really I guess I never
 

757
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,839
new flowers really I guess I never
picked those up so I'm gonna have to

758
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:37,849
picked those up so I'm gonna have to
 

759
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,939
picked those up so I'm gonna have to
head back to that flower for some time

760
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:39,949
head back to that flower for some time
 

761
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:43,569
head back to that flower for some time
to to get more and then we got rid of

762
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:43,579
to to get more and then we got rid of
 

763
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:46,419
to to get more and then we got rid of
the coal here we got grass it's it's not

764
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:46,429
the coal here we got grass it's it's not
 

765
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,359
the coal here we got grass it's it's not
too bad kind of I'm glad I chose gold

766
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:49,369
too bad kind of I'm glad I chose gold
 

767
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,039
too bad kind of I'm glad I chose gold
for the middle because it matches the

768
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,049
for the middle because it matches the
 

769
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,389
for the middle because it matches the
grass color the closest and if we do

770
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:55,399
grass color the closest and if we do
 

771
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,219
grass color the closest and if we do
tall grass and other things it'll it'll

772
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:57,229
tall grass and other things it'll it'll
 

773
00:20:57,229 --> 00:20:59,559
tall grass and other things it'll it'll
probably look better too but then I also

774
00:20:59,559 --> 00:20:59,569
probably look better too but then I also
 

775
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,439
probably look better too but then I also
started working on these upper layers

776
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:01,449
started working on these upper layers
 

777
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,269
started working on these upper layers
because I want to hide stuff up up high

778
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:04,279
because I want to hide stuff up up high
 

779
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,909
because I want to hide stuff up up high
as well not just all in one big pile

780
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:06,919
as well not just all in one big pile
 

781
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,609
as well not just all in one big pile
like I said so let's head on up I don't

782
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:09,619
like I said so let's head on up I don't
 

783
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,999
like I said so let's head on up I don't
have a ladder or anything yet such I

784
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:13,009
have a ladder or anything yet such I
 

785
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,029
have a ladder or anything yet such I
didn't get that far but if we go up we

786
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,039
didn't get that far but if we go up we
 

787
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,639
didn't get that far but if we go up we
got like railing you can look down at

788
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:18,649
got like railing you can look down at
 

789
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:22,340
got like railing you can look down at
the gold pile very cool

790
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,350

area cooler I think and then I polished

824
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:07,800
area cooler I think and then I polished
 

825
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,610
area cooler I think and then I polished
up this area here pretty good I think

826
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:09,620

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:40,620
was still pretty easy the emeralds with
 

843
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,530
was still pretty easy the emeralds with
so I don't know

844
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:42,540
so I don't know
 

845

so I don't know
I thought they would eventually they

846
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,490
I thought they would eventually they
 

847
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,070
I thought they would eventually they
would change it so emeralds would be

848
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
would change it so emeralds would be
 

849
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,400
would change it so emeralds would be
pretty tough to get put - that never

850
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,410
pretty tough to get put - that never
 

851
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,340
pretty tough to get put - that never
happened so all emeralds are kind of

852
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,350
happened so all emeralds are kind of
 

853
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,100
happened so all emeralds are kind of
dirty but we were just going to use

that at least
 

909
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,560
that at least
at my other base diamonds there's

910
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,570
at my other base diamonds there's
 

911

913
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:50,320
redstone I don't know if I want to stash
that Oh anyway so we we got a good start

914
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,330
that Oh anyway so we we got a good start
 

915
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,840
that Oh anyway so we we got a good start
to that there's also another path I want

916
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:52,850
to that there's also another path I want
 

917
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,560
to that there's also another path I want
to make to go to that area so we kind of

918
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,570
to make to go to that area so we kind of
 

919
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,310
to make to go to that area so we kind of
found out that this connects somewhat so

920
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
found out that this connects somewhat so
 

921
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,880
found out that this connects somewhat so
we'll probably do something like this

922
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:03,890
we'll probably do something like this
 

923
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,220
we'll probably do something like this
and have a walkway going going over here

924

935
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,970
how to describe it like every area has
pretty much two or three or four ways of

pretty much two or three or four ways of
 

937
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,390
pretty much two or three or four ways of
getting to it but anyway guys I think we

938
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:31,400
getting to it but anyway guys I think we
 

939
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,090
