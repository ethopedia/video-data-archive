it doesn't you know um yeah this one
over here so I wasn't able to get to the

322
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,050
over here so I wasn't able to get to the
 

323
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,600
over here so I wasn't able to get to the
top very reliably before unless I was

324
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:40,610
top very reliably before unless I was
 

325
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,969
top very reliably before unless I was
riding the horse now it seems to work

326
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:42,979
riding the horse now it seems to work
 

327
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,490
riding the horse now it seems to work
every time with my my player here whoa

328
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:47,500
every time with my my player here whoa
 

329
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,579
every time with my my player here whoa
try it again

330
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:50,589
try it again
 

331
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,230
try it again
even finally this I'm not really on here

332
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
even finally this I'm not really on here
 

333
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,060
even finally this I'm not really on here
properly and it still works so that's

334
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,070
properly and it still works so that's
 

335
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,570
properly and it still works so that's
awesome and those go ten blocks per

336
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:58,580
awesome and those go ten blocks per
 

337
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,850
awesome and those go ten blocks per
second which is a pretty good time

338
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:00,860
second which is a pretty good time
 

339
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,550
second which is a pretty good time
pretty good speed so what I want to do

340
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:03,560
pretty good speed so what I want to do
 

341
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,710
pretty good speed so what I want to do
in my world I like I want to fly around

342
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:05,720
in my world I like I want to fly around
 

343
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,829
in my world I like I want to fly around
you right so we need elevators all over

344
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:08,839
you right so we need elevators all over
 

345
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,280
you right so we need elevators all over
the place I want them spread out and

346
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,290
the place I want them spread out and
 

347
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,720
the place I want them spread out and
like if I want to go somewhere just go

348
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:13,730
like if I want to go somewhere just go
 

349
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,400
like if I want to go somewhere just go
up the elevator and then fly to where I

350
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,410
up the elevator and then fly to where I
 

351
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,540
up the elevator and then fly to where I
want to go and there'll be another

352
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:16,550
want to go and there'll be another
 

353
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,449
want to go and there'll be another
elevator there and I think that's going

354
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:19,459
elevator there and I think that's going
 

355
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,519
elevator there and I think that's going
to be the best way of getting around the

356
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:21,529
to be the best way of getting around the
 

357
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,440
to be the best way of getting around the
question is do we want to do zipper

358
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,450
question is do we want to do zipper
 

359
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,050
question is do we want to do zipper
elevators or do we want to do minecart

360
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,060
elevators or do we want to do minecart
 

361
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,000
elevators or do we want to do minecart
elevators because those are actually

362
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,010
elevators because those are actually
 

363
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,220
elevators because those are actually
faster they don't require redstone hmm

364
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,230
faster they don't require redstone hmm
 

365
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,340
faster they don't require redstone hmm
that's a nice perk of them but the

366
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,350
that's a nice perk of them but the
 

367
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,290
that's a nice perk of them but the
downside is you get like

368
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300
downside is you get like
 

369
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,210
downside is you get like
to get to the top of the world we're

370
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,220
to get to the top of the world we're
 

371
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,740
to get to the top of the world we're
going to need like 30 mine carts and

372
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:42,750
going to need like 30 mine carts and
 

373
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,730
going to need like 30 mine carts and
everyone causes a little bit of lag so

374
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:46,740
everyone causes a little bit of lag so
 

375
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,720
everyone causes a little bit of lag so
there's a there's a trade-off with that

376
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:49,730
there's a there's a trade-off with that
 

377
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,370
there's a there's a trade-off with that
alright guys I just went ahead and built

378
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:52,380
alright guys I just went ahead and built
 

379
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,440
alright guys I just went ahead and built
our first elevator here off camera just

380
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,450
our first elevator here off camera just
 

381
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,389
our first elevator here off camera just
so we can get going and try this out and

382
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
so we can get going and try this out and
 

383
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,430
so we can get going and try this out and
I put it in the man cave you know this

384
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,440
I put it in the man cave you know this
 

385
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,019
I put it in the man cave you know this
area over here where we don't really

386
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:00,029
area over here where we don't really
 

387
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,150
area over here where we don't really
have anything built just added a little

388
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
have anything built just added a little
 

389
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,990
have anything built just added a little
bit on and we now have an elevator nice

390
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
bit on and we now have an elevator nice
 

391
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,970
bit on and we now have an elevator nice
and close to like our main hub here so

392
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:07,980
and close to like our main hub here so
 

393
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,769
and close to like our main hub here so
if I want to go somewhere it's going to

394
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:09,779
if I want to go somewhere it's going to
 

395
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,509
if I want to go somewhere it's going to
be really easy just come up to this spot

396
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
be really easy just come up to this spot
 

397
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,180
be really easy just come up to this spot
here and it's one of these minecart

398
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,190
here and it's one of these minecart
 

399
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,759
here and it's one of these minecart
elevators not not the kind with a track

400
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:16,769
elevators not not the kind with a track
 

401
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,290
elevators not not the kind with a track
you just hold right click get poured it

402
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,300
you just hold right click get poured it
 

403
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,970
you just hold right click get poured it
up to the top I decide to go with this

404
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
up to the top I decide to go with this
 

405
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,819
up to the top I decide to go with this
one because it is very fast to build

406
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:25,829
one because it is very fast to build
 

407
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:29,960
one because it is very fast to build
very cheap to build and I think it's the

408
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:29,970
very cheap to build and I think it's the
 

409
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,199
very cheap to build and I think it's the
fastest one like woah oh I fell already

410
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:33,209
fastest one like woah oh I fell already
 

411
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,019
fastest one like woah oh I fell already
whoops I think it's like the fastest

412
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:36,029
whoops I think it's like the fastest
 

413
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,720
whoops I think it's like the fastest
transport vertically right that that I

414
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,730
transport vertically right that that I
 

415
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,130
transport vertically right that that I
could think of the other ones are 10

416
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,140
could think of the other ones are 10
 

417
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,900
could think of the other ones are 10
blocks per second so if you're going up

418
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:41,910
blocks per second so if you're going up
 

419
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,199
blocks per second so if you're going up
like 200 blocks or whatever that's 20

420
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:45,209
like 200 blocks or whatever that's 20
 

421
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,639
like 200 blocks or whatever that's 20
seconds which is a fair bit at a time

422
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:46,649
seconds which is a fair bit at a time
 

423
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,900
seconds which is a fair bit at a time
and then we can just fly around oh it's

424
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:50,910
and then we can just fly around oh it's
 

425
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,410
and then we can just fly around oh it's
so awesome my little legs ticking in

426
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,420
so awesome my little legs ticking in
 

427
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,500
so awesome my little legs ticking in
there the one thing I'm noticing though

428
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,510
there the one thing I'm noticing though
 

429
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,120
there the one thing I'm noticing though
like I don't think I'm going to build

430
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,130
like I don't think I'm going to build
 

431
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,430
like I don't think I'm going to build
them all right up to the max height

432
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
them all right up to the max height
 

433
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,519
them all right up to the max height
because when you're up this high for

434
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:04,529
because when you're up this high for
 

435
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,650
because when you're up this high for
ideal distance you kind of want to keep

436
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:06,660
ideal distance you kind of want to keep
 

437
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,740
ideal distance you kind of want to keep
your mouse cursor flat like this and you

438
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:09,750
your mouse cursor flat like this and you
 

439
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,650
your mouse cursor flat like this and you
can't really see where you are like you

440
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:12,660
can't really see where you are like you
 

441
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,360
can't really see where you are like you
can't see the world below you unless you

442
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,370
can't see the world below you unless you
 

443
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,010
can't see the world below you unless you
look down and if you look down then you

444
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,020
look down and if you look down then you
 

445
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,190
look down and if you look down then you
then you lose your height you know so

446
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,200
then you lose your height you know so
 

447
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,470
then you lose your height you know so
you probably only really want to go 128

448
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:21,480
you probably only really want to go 128
 

449
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,750
you probably only really want to go 128
blocks up into the sky or so at the most

450
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
blocks up into the sky or so at the most
 

451
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,199
blocks up into the sky or so at the most
yeah this is so cool like oh man I just

452
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:30,209
yeah this is so cool like oh man I just
 

453
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,189
yeah this is so cool like oh man I just
love it I wish I could just keep it like

454
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:34,199
love it I wish I could just keep it like
 

455
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,380
love it I wish I could just keep it like
this height forever though I like flying

456
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,390
this height forever though I like flying
 

457
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,400
this height forever though I like flying
close to the ground and soaring over the

458
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,410
close to the ground and soaring over the
 

459
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,630
close to the ground and soaring over the
the stuff we built is really fun ok guys

460
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
the stuff we built is really fun ok guys
 

461
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,610
the stuff we built is really fun ok guys
so next up here I want to try to a

462
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,620
so next up here I want to try to a
 

463
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,579
so next up here I want to try to a
distance test as well so how far can we

464
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:49,589
distance test as well so how far can we
 

465
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,470
distance test as well so how far can we
get from the top of the world we're at

466
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,480
get from the top of the world we're at
 

467
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,240
get from the top of the world we're at
well pretty much the top of the

468
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,250
well pretty much the top of the
 

469
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,480
well pretty much the top of the
2:54 here we're going to get our cursor

470
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,490
2:54 here we're going to get our cursor
 

471
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,250
2:54 here we're going to get our cursor
nice and flat all right and we're going

472
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,260
nice and flat all right and we're going
 

473
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,320
nice and flat all right and we're going
to be traveling in the Z coordinates so

474
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,330
to be traveling in the Z coordinates so
 

475
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,400
to be traveling in the Z coordinates so
positive Z we're at 217 right now let's

476
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,410
positive Z we're at 217 right now let's
 

477
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,210
positive Z we're at 217 right now let's
go ahead and jump off whew

478
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,220
go ahead and jump off whew
 

479
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,330
go ahead and jump off whew
and just see how far we can get you

480
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,340
and just see how far we can get you
 

481
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,950
and just see how far we can get you
travel very fast don't you we've

482
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:18,960
travel very fast don't you we've
 

483
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,880
travel very fast don't you we've
traveled 200 blocks already the man that

484
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:22,890
traveled 200 blocks already the man that
 

485
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,960
traveled 200 blocks already the man that
is insane three hundred four hundred we

486
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:25,970
is insane three hundred four hundred we
 

487
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,430
is insane three hundred four hundred we
are cruising okay there's the mob Tower

488
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,440
are cruising okay there's the mob Tower
 

489
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,370
are cruising okay there's the mob Tower
so that's from the stronghold base the

490
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:34,380
so that's from the stronghold base the
 

491
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,080
so that's from the stronghold base the
ground is getting pretty close already

492
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,090
ground is getting pretty close already
 

493
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,440
ground is getting pretty close already
though but we've covered a good distance

494
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,450
though but we've covered a good distance
 

495
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,390
though but we've covered a good distance
just about a thousand blocks in desert

496
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:44,400
just about a thousand blocks in desert
 

497
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,190
just about a thousand blocks in desert
we might actually go out of bounds like

498
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,200
we might actually go out of bounds like
 

499
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,230
we might actually go out of bounds like
where I've been the farthest this that

500
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,240
where I've been the farthest this that
 

501
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,210
where I've been the farthest this that
island there's an island yeah this is

502
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,220
island there's an island yeah this is
 

503
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,010
island there's an island yeah this is
the one we tried to blow up to make a

504
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,020
the one we tried to blow up to make a
 

505
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,420
the one we tried to blow up to make a
passive mob spawner and there's a

506
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,430
passive mob spawner and there's a
 

507
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,220
passive mob spawner and there's a
there's a guardian fortress down below

508
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,230
there's a guardian fortress down below
 

509
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,820
there's a guardian fortress down below
there now I see an 1800 I'm gonna hate

510
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:07,830
there now I see an 1800 I'm gonna hate
 

511
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:14,750
there now I see an 1800 I'm gonna hate
walking back this is so far mm okay so

512
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
walking back this is so far mm okay so
 

513
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,300
walking back this is so far mm okay so
that's about 1800 blocks we traveled

514
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,310
that's about 1800 blocks we traveled
 

515
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,320
that's about 1800 blocks we traveled
going down to Wai 64 that's that's crazy

516
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,330
going down to Wai 64 that's that's crazy
 

517
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,730
going down to Wai 64 that's that's crazy
alright well I got to get back so I'm

518
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:25,740
alright well I got to get back so I'm
 

519
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,920
alright well I got to get back so I'm
gonna use the boats try them out I think

520
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:27,930
gonna use the boats try them out I think
 

521
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,030
gonna use the boats try them out I think
they sped them up they're definitely

522
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
they sped them up they're definitely
 

523
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,350
they sped them up they're definitely
going faster now okay we are still going

524
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
going faster now okay we are still going
 

525
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,320
going faster now okay we are still going
the wrong way which is the right way

526
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,330
the wrong way which is the right way
 

527
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,120
the wrong way which is the right way
opposite way

528
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,130
opposite way
 

529
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,850
opposite way
this way right yes okay oh there there a

530
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:43,860
this way right yes okay oh there there a
 

531
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,020
this way right yes okay oh there there a
little bit more all over the place

532
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,030
little bit more all over the place
 

533
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,000
little bit more all over the place
because they have more power now here we

534
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,010
because they have more power now here we
 

535
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,370
because they have more power now here we
go

536
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,380
go
 

537
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,710
go
okay let's check our our thing here so

538
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:51,720
okay let's check our our thing here so
 

539
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,570
okay let's check our our thing here so
we're moving at a pretty decent speed

540
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:53,580
we're moving at a pretty decent speed
 

541
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,280
we're moving at a pretty decent speed
not crazy fast but that's pretty good

542
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,290
not crazy fast but that's pretty good
 

543
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,420
not crazy fast but that's pretty good
okay so I'm building another elevator

544
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,430
okay so I'm building another elevator
 

545
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,130
okay so I'm building another elevator
right now and I wanted to show you guys

546
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,140
right now and I wanted to show you guys
 

547
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,470
right now and I wanted to show you guys
just how easy it is to to make

548
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
just how easy it is to to make
 

549
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,660
just how easy it is to to make
these how quickly you can do it because

550
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:08,670
these how quickly you can do it because
 

551
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,370
these how quickly you can do it because
a lot of people struggle getting the

552
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:10,380
a lot of people struggle getting the
 

553
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,500
a lot of people struggle getting the
minecart in that's all you got to do

554
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,510
minecart in that's all you got to do
 

555
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,170
minecart in that's all you got to do
it's so so simple okay and then the

556
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,180
it's so so simple okay and then the
 

557
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,300
it's so so simple okay and then the
minecart set the second block third

558
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,310
minecart set the second block third
 

559
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,420
minecart set the second block third
block fourth block fifth block and your

560
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,430
block fourth block fifth block and your
 

561
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,689
block fourth block fifth block and your
ladder and then you just pull her up you

562
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:23,699
ladder and then you just pull her up you
 

563
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,689
ladder and then you just pull her up you
can do it fairly quick to actually go

564
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:26,699
can do it fairly quick to actually go
 

565
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,240
can do it fairly quick to actually go
one above the ladder and then next

566
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,250
one above the ladder and then next
 

567
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,960
one above the ladder and then next
minecarts and just keep going all the

568
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:32,970
minecarts and just keep going all the
 

569
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,220
minecarts and just keep going all the
way up it doesn't take very long

570
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,230
way up it doesn't take very long
 

571
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,300
way up it doesn't take very long
actually so second third fourth fifth

572
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,310
actually so second third fourth fifth
 

573
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,189
actually so second third fourth fifth
ladder again I like to place that first

574
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
ladder again I like to place that first
 

575
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,790
ladder again I like to place that first
I know how high I need to build it up to

576
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
I know how high I need to build it up to
 

577
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,460
I know how high I need to build it up to
and I like to carry like a stack of iron

578
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,470
and I like to carry like a stack of iron
 

579
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,379
and I like to carry like a stack of iron
on me so I can make more minecarts and

580
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:48,389
on me so I can make more minecarts and
 

581
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,269
on me so I can make more minecarts and
like you have have stuff to make a

582
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:50,279
like you have have stuff to make a
 

583
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,819
like you have have stuff to make a
crafting bench up here and and then

584
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:52,829
crafting bench up here and and then
 

585
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:58,340
crafting bench up here and and then
nothing should slow you down now the

586
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,350
nothing should slow you down now the
 

587
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,439
nothing should slow you down now the
only thing about these elevators though

588
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:00,449
only thing about these elevators though
 

589
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,199
only thing about these elevators though
is they look pretty ugly don't take and

590
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:03,209
is they look pretty ugly don't take and
 

591
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,060
is they look pretty ugly don't take and
you can't hide them like how would you

592
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,070
you can't hide them like how would you
 

593
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,660
you can't hide them like how would you
hide that you could build that tree but

594
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:08,670
hide that you could build that tree but
 

595
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,370
hide that you could build that tree but
it's going to be a really giant out of

596
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:10,380
it's going to be a really giant out of
 

597
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,590
it's going to be a really giant out of
place looking tree you know so what do

598
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:12,600
place looking tree you know so what do
 

599
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,290
place looking tree you know so what do
you do there's the other one we built

600
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,300
you do there's the other one we built
 

601
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,210
you do there's the other one we built
over there

602
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,220
over there
 

603
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,530
over there
although beacons are ugly too I don't

604
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:18,540
although beacons are ugly too I don't
 

605
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,809
although beacons are ugly too I don't
really like beacons I should almost hide

606
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:20,819
really like beacons I should almost hide
 

607
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,490
really like beacons I should almost hide
them together like put the beacon in the

608
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,500
them together like put the beacon in the
 

609
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,290
them together like put the beacon in the
middle of the elevator so at least we

610
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
middle of the elevator so at least we
 

611
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,410
middle of the elevator so at least we
get rid of some of this vertical you

612
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:27,420
get rid of some of this vertical you
 

613
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,740
get rid of some of this vertical you
know lines in the sky I don't like them

614
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:29,750
know lines in the sky I don't like them
 

615
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,199
know lines in the sky I don't like them
um let's try this out so this one's a

616
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,209
um let's try this out so this one's a
 

617
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,620
um let's try this out so this one's a
little bit lower it's at 128 I believe

618
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:35,630
little bit lower it's at 128 I believe
 

619
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,280
little bit lower it's at 128 I believe
so not nearly as high up nice thing

620
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,290
so not nearly as high up nice thing
 

621
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,480
so not nearly as high up nice thing
about that is we can get to the top

622
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,490
about that is we can get to the top
 

623
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,340
about that is we can get to the top
quicker and it should do what we want to

624
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,350
quicker and it should do what we want to
 

625
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,509
quicker and it should do what we want to
do so we're we're flying and we can get

626
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
do so we're we're flying and we can get
 

627
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,420
do so we're we're flying and we can get
to this elevator from it so if we wanna

628
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,430
to this elevator from it so if we wanna
 

629
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,129
to this elevator from it so if we wanna
go further we just hop in this one but

630
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:58,139
go further we just hop in this one but
 

631
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,829
go further we just hop in this one but
we can probably get five hundred to a

632
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:00,839
we can probably get five hundred to a
 

633
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,509
we can probably get five hundred to a
thousand blocks distance just from that

634
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:02,519
thousand blocks distance just from that
 

635
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,139
thousand blocks distance just from that
little bit of height okay so I want to

636
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:06,149
little bit of height okay so I want to
 

637
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:07,430
little bit of height okay so I want to
play around with the boats a little bit

638
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
play around with the boats a little bit
 

639
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,900
play around with the boats a little bit
today as well guys we're gonna do a few

640
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:08,910
today as well guys we're gonna do a few
 

641
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,710
today as well guys we're gonna do a few
tests with them the first thing oh that

642
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
tests with them the first thing oh that
 

643
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,309
tests with them the first thing oh that
was the zombie right yeah that sizzle

644
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:16,319
was the zombie right yeah that sizzle
 

645
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,309
was the zombie right yeah that sizzle
scared me first thing we're going to do

646
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:19,319
scared me first thing we're going to do
 

647
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,450
scared me first thing we're going to do
is take it out on the rig

648
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:20,460
is take it out on the rig
 

649
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,710
is take it out on the rig
here this is going to be a really good

650
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:21,720
here this is going to be a really good
 

651
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,660
here this is going to be a really good
test to compare them to the old boats

652
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:23,670
test to compare them to the old boats
 

653
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,750
test to compare them to the old boats
because we were just barely able to get

654
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:26,760
because we were just barely able to get
 

655
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,700
because we were just barely able to get
through this but at full speed with old

656
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:28,710
through this but at full speed with old
 

657
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,080
through this but at full speed with old
boats and I want to see how comparable

658
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,090
boats and I want to see how comparable
 

659
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,000
boats and I want to see how comparable
the new is with the olds I guess it's

660
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,010
the new is with the olds I guess it's
 

661
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,350
the new is with the olds I guess it's
going to be tough to get through to

662
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:36,360
going to be tough to get through to
 

663
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,010
going to be tough to get through to
control so far not too bad actually I

664
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,020
control so far not too bad actually I
 

665
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,180
control so far not too bad actually I
don't know though are these I don't

666
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,190
don't know though are these I don't
 

667
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,040
don't know though are these I don't
think it's quite as fast as the old boat

668
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,050
think it's quite as fast as the old boat
 

669
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,570
think it's quite as fast as the old boat
still I think they need to bump up the

670
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:47,580
still I think they need to bump up the
 

671
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,180
still I think they need to bump up the
speed a bit more light I think it's

672
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,190
speed a bit more light I think it's
 

673
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,180
speed a bit more light I think it's
faster than running now but it could be

674
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,190
faster than running now but it could be
 

675
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,260
faster than running now but it could be
a bit faster it's actually surprisingly

676
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,270
a bit faster it's actually surprisingly
 

677
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,100
a bit faster it's actually surprisingly
easy to control this yeah we're getting

678
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,110
easy to control this yeah we're getting
 

679
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,090
easy to control this yeah we're getting
through this a lot better and I thought

680
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,100
through this a lot better and I thought
 

681
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,610
through this a lot better and I thought
we would there's also that new addition

682
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,620
we would there's also that new addition
 

683
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,960
we would there's also that new addition
we added on that's a little bit narrower

684
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:08,970
we added on that's a little bit narrower
 

685
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,840
we added on that's a little bit narrower
I believe so let's go to that just

686
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:11,850
I believe so let's go to that just
 

687
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,530
I believe so let's go to that just
around here which I don't know if we

688
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,540
around here which I don't know if we
 

689
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,570
around here which I don't know if we
were able to do with the old boats but

690
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:17,580
were able to do with the old boats but
 

691
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,590
were able to do with the old boats but
we'll try it out with the new ones

692
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,600
we'll try it out with the new ones
 

693
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,070
we'll try it out with the new ones
anyway

694
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,080
anyway
 

695
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,280
anyway
gotta go under the bridge date wait a

696
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,290
gotta go under the bridge date wait a
 

697
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,230
gotta go under the bridge date wait a
second so they're doing this thing which

698
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
second so they're doing this thing which
 

699
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,140
second so they're doing this thing which
I don't like

700
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,150
I don't like
 

701
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,520
I don't like
let me explain so when you were going

702
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:28,530
let me explain so when you were going
 

703
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,130
let me explain so when you were going
straight if I let go of D we start

704
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,140
straight if I let go of D we start
 

705
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,990
straight if I let go of D we start
drifting to the right when I reactivate

706
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,000
drifting to the right when I reactivate
 

707
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,970
drifting to the right when I reactivate
D it kind of pushes us back to the left

708
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
D it kind of pushes us back to the left
 

709
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,630
D it kind of pushes us back to the left
it shouldn't do that in my opinion okay

710
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:41,640
it shouldn't do that in my opinion okay
 

711
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,510
it shouldn't do that in my opinion okay
let go D activate you see how it drifts

712
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,520
let go D activate you see how it drifts
 

713
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,430
let go D activate you see how it drifts
to the left a little bit it makes it

714
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,440
to the left a little bit it makes it
 

715
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,730
to the left a little bit it makes it
really wavy feeling and that I find that

716
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:48,740
really wavy feeling and that I find that
 

717
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,160
really wavy feeling and that I find that
hard I don't like that I want it to be a

718
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,170
hard I don't like that I want it to be a
 

719
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,710
hard I don't like that I want it to be a
smooth like even just like changing

720
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
smooth like even just like changing
 

721
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,340
smooth like even just like changing
directions it's really jerky which I

722
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,350
directions it's really jerky which I
 

723
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,840
directions it's really jerky which I
have mixed feelings about I think it

724
00:17:59,840 --> 00:17:59,850
have mixed feelings about I think it
 

725
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,670
have mixed feelings about I think it
should be smoother but it's got a few

726
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:04,680
should be smoother but it's got a few
 

727
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,770
should be smoother but it's got a few
things going for it like it's it doesn't

728
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:06,780
things going for it like it's it doesn't
 

729
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,680
things going for it like it's it doesn't
break you can move mobs around with it I

730
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:09,690
break you can move mobs around with it I
 

731
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,840
break you can move mobs around with it I
think they look better than the old

732
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,850
think they look better than the old
 

733
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,870
think they look better than the old
boats I just think they need to be a bit

734
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
boats I just think they need to be a bit
 

735
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,260
boats I just think they need to be a bit
faster and maybe a bit smoother and they

736
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,270
faster and maybe a bit smoother and they
 

737
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,120
faster and maybe a bit smoother and they
would be perfect but yeah they're easy

738
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,130
would be perfect but yeah they're easy
 

739
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,950
would be perfect but yeah they're easy
to control we're getting through this no

740
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
to control we're getting through this no
 

741
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,980
to control we're getting through this no
problem

742
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:26,990
problem
 

743
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,400
problem
uh-huh

744
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,410
uh-huh
 

745
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,620
uh-huh
anyway I want to also take this over to

746
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:30,630
anyway I want to also take this over to
 

747
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,480
anyway I want to also take this over to
that eats road we built and just see

748
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:32,490
that eats road we built and just see
 

749
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,880
that eats road we built and just see
what it does with that

750
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,890
what it does with that
 

751
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,000
what it does with that
I forgot we have like jumps and stuff in

752
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,010
I forgot we have like jumps and stuff in
 

753
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,810
I forgot we have like jumps and stuff in
it

754
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:37,820
it
 

755
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,850
it
I'll be surprised that this works with

756
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:39,860
I'll be surprised that this works with
 

757
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,930
I'll be surprised that this works with
no adjustments but we'll try it out here

758
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:42,940
no adjustments but we'll try it out here
 

759
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,730
no adjustments but we'll try it out here
alright so there is a dispenser we can

760
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:45,740
alright so there is a dispenser we can
 

761
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,030
alright so there is a dispenser we can
just put the boat in I can reach it yeah

762
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,040
just put the boat in I can reach it yeah
 

763
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,950
just put the boat in I can reach it yeah
oh it actually converted the old boats

764
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
oh it actually converted the old boats
 

765
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,130
oh it actually converted the old boats
into the new ones that's cool okay and

766
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,140
into the new ones that's cool okay and
 

767
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,720
into the new ones that's cool okay and
then there was a button somewhere around

768
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:55,730
then there was a button somewhere around
 

769
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,940
then there was a button somewhere around
here I thought I was it just over here

770
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:00,950
here I thought I was it just over here
 

771
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,010
here I thought I was it just over here
okay it's just over here so you have to

772
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,020
okay it's just over here so you have to
 

773
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,880
okay it's just over here so you have to
hop in as it goes by and that's not a

774
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:06,890
hop in as it goes by and that's not a
 

775
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,820
hop in as it goes by and that's not a
good sign that is not a good sign it's

776
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:09,830
good sign that is not a good sign it's
 

777
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,560
good sign that is not a good sign it's
not really oh wait it's not really going

778
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:14,570
not really oh wait it's not really going
 

779
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,660
not really oh wait it's not really going
just by the water currents is it it's

780
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:19,670
just by the water currents is it it's
 

781
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,750
just by the water currents is it it's
falling between them that one block

782
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:22,760
falling between them that one block
 

783
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,360
falling between them that one block
space it fits in it oh when it's on the

784
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,370
space it fits in it oh when it's on the
 

785
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,700
space it fits in it oh when it's on the
water though it seems to do pretty good

786
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:30,710
water though it seems to do pretty good
 

787
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:43,750
water though it seems to do pretty good
oh no fall damage huh oh it broke yeah

788
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
oh no fall damage huh oh it broke yeah
 

789
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,260
oh no fall damage huh oh it broke yeah
it broke I didn't I didn't bust it how

790
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,270
it broke I didn't I didn't bust it how
 

791
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,820
it broke I didn't I didn't bust it how
about we try this now we're gonna put

792
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,830
about we try this now we're gonna put
 

793
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,450
about we try this now we're gonna put
the boat down and then paddle so we put

794
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:52,460
the boat down and then paddle so we put
 

795
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,640
the boat down and then paddle so we put
it between no it won't let us put it put

796
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,650
it between no it won't let us put it put
 

797
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,200
it between no it won't let us put it put
it between because it's colliding with

798
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,210
it between because it's colliding with
 

799
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,090
it between because it's colliding with
that so we have to put it here and then

800
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,100
that so we have to put it here and then
 

801
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,350
that so we have to put it here and then
push it I think okay oh can we not push

802
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,360
push it I think okay oh can we not push
 

803
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,630
push it I think okay oh can we not push
yeah we can push push push it's like

804
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,640
yeah we can push push push it's like
 

805
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,050
yeah we can push push push it's like
pushing a stalled out car or something

806
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,060
pushing a stalled out car or something
 

807
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,260
pushing a stalled out car or something
all right

808
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,270
all right
 

809
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,810
all right
and now we want to paddle I can't tell

810
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:13,820
and now we want to paddle I can't tell
 

811
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,740
and now we want to paddle I can't tell
where I'm looking even we're facing the

812
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,750
where I'm looking even we're facing the
 

813
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,520
where I'm looking even we're facing the
wrong way okay let's turn around the

814
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:21,530
wrong way okay let's turn around the
 

815
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,450
wrong way okay let's turn around the
nice thing is that shouldn't ever break

816
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:24,460
nice thing is that shouldn't ever break
 

817
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,290
nice thing is that shouldn't ever break
which is a big deal alright yeah even

818
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:29,300
which is a big deal alright yeah even
 

819
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,240
which is a big deal alright yeah even
though we're going like with the water

820
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,250
though we're going like with the water
 

821
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,280
though we're going like with the water
now the boats facing like with the water

822
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,290
now the boats facing like with the water
 

823
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,980
now the boats facing like with the water
we're still falling between the cracks

824
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:37,990

 

825
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,480

alright let's try here is nice straight

826
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,490
alright let's try here is nice straight
 

827
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,210
alright let's try here is nice straight
away

828
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,220
away
 

829
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:48,330
away
get on that water whoa it doesn't seem

830
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,340
get on that water whoa it doesn't seem
 

831
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,100
get on that water whoa it doesn't seem
yeah you know when we're under the glass

832
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,110
yeah you know when we're under the glass
 

833
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:56,639
yeah you know when we're under the glass
it really doesn't work here okay let's

834
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:56,649
it really doesn't work here okay let's
 

835
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:00,749
it really doesn't work here okay let's
try this this is so bad I have some

836
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:00,759
try this this is so bad I have some
 

837
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,560
try this this is so bad I have some
ideas to fix it but yeah we'll have to

838
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,570
ideas to fix it but yeah we'll have to
 

839
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,580
ideas to fix it but yeah we'll have to
change it a lot so let's just get the

840
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:08,590
change it a lot so let's just get the
 

841
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,590
change it a lot so let's just get the
basic mechanics of these boats figured

842
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:10,600
basic mechanics of these boats figured
 

843
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,230
basic mechanics of these boats figured
out okay so first off if we do this is

844
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,240
out okay so first off if we do this is
 

845
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,820
out okay so first off if we do this is
that going to move the boat quickly

846
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:16,830
that going to move the boat quickly
 

847
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,619
that going to move the boat quickly
seemed decent let's try it again yeah so

848
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:22,629
seemed decent let's try it again yeah so
 

849
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,600
seemed decent let's try it again yeah so
it does boost it I don't think it's

850
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,610
it does boost it I don't think it's
 

851
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,009
it does boost it I don't think it's
quite as significant as the old boat so

852
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:28,019
quite as significant as the old boat so
 

853
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,970
quite as significant as the old boat so
we put it there it almost seems like the

854
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:32,980
we put it there it almost seems like the
 

855
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,100
we put it there it almost seems like the
more the boat is in the water stream the

856
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,110
more the boat is in the water stream the
 

857
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,759
more the boat is in the water stream the
faster it gets moved by it

858
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:40,769

 

859
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,680

uh-huh

860
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:42,690
uh-huh
 

861
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,869
uh-huh
because it sort of slowly pulls it along

862
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:45,879
because it sort of slowly pulls it along
 

863
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,249
because it sort of slowly pulls it along
at first and then when it really gets

864
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:47,259
at first and then when it really gets
 

865
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:50,310
at first and then when it really gets
into it then it then it goes let's do

866
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
into it then it then it goes let's do
 

867
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,070
into it then it then it goes let's do
this now we'll put a covering over top

868
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
this now we'll put a covering over top
 

869
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,629
this now we'll put a covering over top
that's the key to the eats road but

870
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:54,639
that's the key to the eats road but
 

871
00:21:54,639 --> 00:22:02,820
that's the key to the eats road but
maybe that's not a thing anymore yeah

872
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:02,830
maybe that's not a thing anymore yeah
 

873
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,639
maybe that's not a thing anymore yeah
that didn't do anything it's just like

874
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:05,649
that didn't do anything it's just like
 

875
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:06,659
that didn't do anything it's just like
dragged along it

876
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:06,669
dragged along it
 

877
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,820
dragged along it
let's try ice I don't like it's I don't

878
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:08,830
let's try ice I don't like it's I don't
 

879
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,320
let's try ice I don't like it's I don't
think it's gonna factor in the slippery

880
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,330
think it's gonna factor in the slippery
 

881
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,320
think it's gonna factor in the slippery
effect but hey you never know it's worth

882
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,330
effect but hey you never know it's worth
 

883
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,100
effect but hey you never know it's worth
trying you wanted to run into my boat

884
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,110
trying you wanted to run into my boat
 

885
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,769
trying you wanted to run into my boat
didn't you I was about to place it and

886
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:19,779
didn't you I was about to place it and
 

887
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:26,129
didn't you I was about to place it and
he was going for it okay and same that

888
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:26,139
he was going for it okay and same that
 

889
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,149
he was going for it okay and same that
same okay we could also try put ice down

890
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
same okay we could also try put ice down
 

891
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,629
same okay we could also try put ice down
here I really dealt we'll do anything

892
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:33,639
here I really dealt we'll do anything
 

893
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:38,119
here I really dealt we'll do anything
but it's always good to be thorough

894
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,129

 

895
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:44,810

okay and give another go

896
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:44,820
okay and give another go
 

897
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,360
okay and give another go
so slime block like sideways slime block

898
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,370
so slime block like sideways slime block
 

899
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,649
so slime block like sideways slime block
launchers seem like they're going to be

900
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:49,659
launchers seem like they're going to be
 

901
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,210
launchers seem like they're going to be
the best way if you want to do a road

902
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,220
the best way if you want to do a road
 

903
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,880
the best way if you want to do a road
with boats

904
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:53,890

 

905
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,580

okay so I got alternating water streams

906
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:56,590
okay so I got alternating water streams
 

907
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,780
okay so I got alternating water streams
here we're going to try get the boat

908
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:57,790
here we're going to try get the boat
 

909
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,070
here we're going to try get the boat
right in the middle and paddle at the

910
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
right in the middle and paddle at the
 

911
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,810
right in the middle and paddle at the
same time and we'll see if that gives us

912
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:03,820
same time and we'll see if that gives us
 

913
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,310
same time and we'll see if that gives us
any significant speed boost or anything

914
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,320
any significant speed boost or anything
 

915
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,340
any significant speed boost or anything
so let's turn it around kind of got the

916
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,350
so let's turn it around kind of got the
 

917
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,720
so let's turn it around kind of got the
fencer to align us a bit better and

918
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,730
fencer to align us a bit better and
 

919
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,070
fencer to align us a bit better and
we're a little bit on the left though

920
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,080
we're a little bit on the left though
 

921
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,440
we're a little bit on the left though
mm-hmm how tough is this gonna be I

922
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,450
mm-hmm how tough is this gonna be I
 

923
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,680
mm-hmm how tough is this gonna be I
wonder we're still not floating you got

924
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:25,690
wonder we're still not floating you got
 

925
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,180
wonder we're still not floating you got
to be floating for it to really like

926
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,190
to be floating for it to really like
 

927
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,740
to be floating for it to really like
move you so we might have to get man

928
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:31,750
move you so we might have to get man
 

929
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,169
move you so we might have to get man
we're still not floating okay and then

930
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:34,179
we're still not floating okay and then
 

931
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,169
we're still not floating okay and then
we fell you gotta be really precise I

932
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:37,179
we fell you gotta be really precise I
 

933
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:39,030
we fell you gotta be really precise I
don't know if you could get like right

934
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,040
don't know if you could get like right
 

935
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:46,070
don't know if you could get like right
in the middle oh oh oh no

936
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
in the middle oh oh oh no
 

937
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,570
in the middle oh oh oh no
yeah the room for air is so small that's

938
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:51,580
yeah the room for air is so small that's
 

939
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,289
yeah the room for air is so small that's
not going to work here's a really

940
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:55,299
not going to work here's a really
 

941
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:58,260
not going to work here's a really
interesting test so I put water on top

942
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,270
interesting test so I put water on top
 

943
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,080
interesting test so I put water on top
of path box path blocks are a little bit

944
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,090
of path box path blocks are a little bit
 

945
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,720
of path box path blocks are a little bit
sunk down in the ground so when you put

946
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,730
sunk down in the ground so when you put
 

947
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,990
sunk down in the ground so when you put
your boat here the water pulls it along

948
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,000
your boat here the water pulls it along
 

949
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,390
your boat here the water pulls it along
right but never does it float so it

950
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
right but never does it float so it
 

951
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,060
right but never does it float so it
seems like if the boat is touching water

952
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,070
seems like if the boat is touching water
 

953
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,039
seems like if the boat is touching water
if it's in water it'll drag along like

954
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,049
if it's in water it'll drag along like
 

955
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:19,169
if it's in water it'll drag along like
that but in order to actually get the

956
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:19,179
that but in order to actually get the
 

957
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:22,380
that but in order to actually get the
real speed for it to like take off the

958
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,390
real speed for it to like take off the
 

959
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,210
real speed for it to like take off the
very middle of the boat and the very

960
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,220
very middle of the boat and the very
 

961
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,260
very middle of the boat and the very
bottom of the boat need to be in water

962
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,270
bottom of the boat need to be in water
 

963
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:32,159
bottom of the boat need to be in water
that seems to be the key so it went once

964
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,169
that seems to be the key so it went once
 

965
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:39,180
that seems to be the key so it went once
it hits this it should pick up and it's

966
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,190
it hits this it should pick up and it's
 

967
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,560
it hits this it should pick up and it's
a downward flowing water there yeah it

968
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:43,570
a downward flowing water there yeah it
 

969
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,030
a downward flowing water there yeah it
kind of

970
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,040
kind of
 

971
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,100
kind of
oh that's weird huh why did it go so far

972
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,110
oh that's weird huh why did it go so far
 

973
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,450
oh that's weird huh why did it go so far
away it kind of like just dragged for a

974
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,460
away it kind of like just dragged for a
 

975
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,830
away it kind of like just dragged for a
little bit there that was really weird

976
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
little bit there that was really weird
 

977
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,510
little bit there that was really weird
because normally like when we were

978
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
because normally like when we were
 

979
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,070
because normally like when we were
riding it on the top of the water it

980
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,080
riding it on the top of the water it
 

981
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,950
riding it on the top of the water it
would just fall right here and actually

982
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:01,960
would just fall right here and actually
 

983
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,320
would just fall right here and actually
went a block hmm same deal as before

984
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,330
went a block hmm same deal as before
 

985
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,510
went a block hmm same deal as before
here so it's going to be sitting on the

986
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
here so it's going to be sitting on the
 

987
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
here so it's going to be sitting on the
path blocks below its floating points

988
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,770
path blocks below its floating points
 

989
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,150
path blocks below its floating points
but it's gonna hit this downward flowing

990
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,160
but it's gonna hit this downward flowing
 

991
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,670
but it's gonna hit this downward flowing
water and what does it do it drags along

992
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:20,680
water and what does it do it drags along
 

993
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,000
water and what does it do it drags along
without floating it's very strange just

994
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,010
without floating it's very strange just
 

995
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,710
without floating it's very strange just
out of curiosity what happens if we

996
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
out of curiosity what happens if we
 

997
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,810
out of curiosity what happens if we
change it from downward flowing water to

998
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:30,820
change it from downward flowing water to
 

999
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,430
change it from downward flowing water to
just stationary water I'm going to fill

1000
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:32,440
just stationary water I'm going to fill
 

1001
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,450
just stationary water I'm going to fill
the bottom up here alright so there was

1002
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:36,460
the bottom up here alright so there was
 

1003
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,570
the bottom up here alright so there was
no water in the bottom there before the

1004
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:39,580
no water in the bottom there before the
 

1005
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,490
no water in the bottom there before the
top was just flowing down into it now it

1006
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:41,500
top was just flowing down into it now it
 

1007
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,510
top was just flowing down into it now it
should be solid water and do the same

1008
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
should be solid water and do the same
 

1009
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,840
should be solid water and do the same
thing is it going to go any faster do

1010
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:48,850
thing is it going to go any faster do
 

1011
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:56,550
thing is it going to go any faster do
anything different same thing okay

1012
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:56,560

 

1013
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,500

okay I should have done this first I

1014
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,510
okay I should have done this first I
 

1015
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,060
okay I should have done this first I
guess but it turns out if you place a

1016
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,070
guess but it turns out if you place a
 

1017
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,380
guess but it turns out if you place a
boat while underwater it just sinks it's

1018
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,390
boat while underwater it just sinks it's
 

1019
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,760
boat while underwater it just sinks it's
not like the old boats that would float

1020
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:05,770
not like the old boats that would float
 

1021
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,040
not like the old boats that would float
up it just sinks to the bottom like that

1022
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,050
up it just sinks to the bottom like that
 

1023
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,760
up it just sinks to the bottom like that
and if you hop in it just kicks you out

1024
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:11,770
and if you hop in it just kicks you out
 

1025
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:18,750
and if you hop in it just kicks you out
automatically no oh I'm very sad now I

1026
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:18,760
automatically no oh I'm very sad now I
 

1027
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,580
automatically no oh I'm very sad now I
wanted to make a submarine to be honest

1028
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:20,590
wanted to make a submarine to be honest
 

1029
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,100
wanted to make a submarine to be honest
that was my plan and this kind of just

1030
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,110
that was my plan and this kind of just
 

1031
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,990
that was my plan and this kind of just
killed it for me so yeah you can start

1032
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
killed it for me so yeah you can start
 

1033
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,120
killed it for me so yeah you can start
in the boat but as soon as it gets

1034
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,130
in the boat but as soon as it gets
 

1035
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,830
in the boat but as soon as it gets
invalid like when it detects you're

1036
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
invalid like when it detects you're
 

1037
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,930
invalid like when it detects you're
underwater in a boat just ticks you out

1038
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:33,940
underwater in a boat just ticks you out
 

1039
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,840
underwater in a boat just ticks you out
automatically so that kind of sucks well

1040
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:39,850
automatically so that kind of sucks well
 

1041
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,670
automatically so that kind of sucks well
it turns out it might not be a totally

1042
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:41,680
it turns out it might not be a totally
 

1043
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,530
it turns out it might not be a totally
busted idea so check this out

1044
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:43,540
busted idea so check this out
 

1045
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,640
busted idea so check this out
you have your boats it sinks oh no my

1046
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:47,650
you have your boats it sinks oh no my
 

1047
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,890
you have your boats it sinks oh no my
poor boats I can't hop in it no it won't

1048
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:49,900
poor boats I can't hop in it no it won't
 

1049
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,460
poor boats I can't hop in it no it won't
let me

1050
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:50,470
let me
 

1051
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,160
let me
alright then you push it into our little

1052
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,170
alright then you push it into our little
 

1053
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,160
alright then you push it into our little
track here so it's just ladders

1054
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,170
track here so it's just ladders
 

1055
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:04,380
track here so it's just ladders
underwater in a straight line and oh the

1056
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,390
underwater in a straight line and oh the
 

1057
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,580
underwater in a straight line and oh the
boats alive again and I don't know if

1058
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:08,590
boats alive again and I don't know if
 

1059
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,900
boats alive again and I don't know if
it's actually getting stuck under the

1060
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:09,910
it's actually getting stuck under the
 

1061
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,860
it's actually getting stuck under the
ladders but yeah you can actually row it

1062
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:13,870
ladders but yeah you can actually row it
 

1063
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,010
ladders but yeah you can actually row it
then and for a moment you can go

1064
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,020
then and for a moment you can go
 

1065
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,400
then and for a moment you can go
underwater before it kicks you out like

1066
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,410
underwater before it kicks you out like
 

1067
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,180
underwater before it kicks you out like
looks like one two three four four to

1068
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,190
looks like one two three four four to
 

1069
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,740
looks like one two three four four to
five blocks maybe I'm gonna try here

1070
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:28,750
five blocks maybe I'm gonna try here
 

1071
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,940
five blocks maybe I'm gonna try here
let's try this so we're going to add

1072
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:29,950
let's try this so we're going to add
 

1073
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,580
let's try this so we're going to add
just a three block gap and see if we can

1074
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:32,590
just a three block gap and see if we can
 

1075
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,950
just a three block gap and see if we can
skip a little bit of the track and

1076
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
skip a little bit of the track and
 

1077
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,820
skip a little bit of the track and
continue on here before it kicks us out

1078
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:37,830
continue on here before it kicks us out
 

1079
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,150
continue on here before it kicks us out
huh

1080
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,160
huh
 

1081
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,760
huh
I want a submarine man it's been my

1082
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:44,770
I want a submarine man it's been my
 

1083
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,190
I want a submarine man it's been my
dream in this game for so long oh you

1084
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
dream in this game for so long oh you
 

1085
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,170
dream in this game for so long oh you
see that it was above the the air pocket

1086
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,180
see that it was above the the air pocket
 

1087
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,550
see that it was above the the air pocket
there and it just kind of sucked it down

1088
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,560
there and it just kind of sucked it down
 

1089
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,710
there and it just kind of sucked it down
right into place which is kind of nice

1090
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
right into place which is kind of nice
 

1091
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
right into place which is kind of nice
it's really easy to position it at squid

1092
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,210
it's really easy to position it at squid
 

1093
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,350
it's really easy to position it at squid
bit or not oh I missed it darn it I hit

1094
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,360
bit or not oh I missed it darn it I hit
 

1095
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,340
bit or not oh I missed it darn it I hit
the block this episode's getting a bit

1096
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,350
the block this episode's getting a bit
 

1097
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,840
the block this episode's getting a bit
on the long side this is the last thing

1098
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:03,850
on the long side this is the last thing
 

1099
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,030
on the long side this is the last thing
we're going to try to date but it looks

1100
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,040
we're going to try to date but it looks
 

1101
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,250
we're going to try to date but it looks
like submarines could be pretty cool

1102
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,260
like submarines could be pretty cool
 

1103
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,440
like submarines could be pretty cool

upside-down half slabs this time for

1106
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,180
upside-down half slabs this time for

upside-down half slabs this time for
better visibility the ladders you have

1108
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,040
better visibility the ladders you have
 

1109
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,100
better visibility the ladders you have
to have a block on the side right which

1110
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,110
to have a block on the side right which
 

1111
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,970
to have a block on the side right which
isn't as good

1112
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:17,980
isn't as good
 

1113
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,420
isn't as good
oops we got kicked out but with the

1114
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,430
oops we got kicked out but with the
 

1115
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,610
oops we got kicked out but with the
slabs look at this like it renders an

1116
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:23,620
slabs look at this like it renders an
 

1117
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,410
slabs look at this like it renders an
extra layer of water which blocks the

1118
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:25,420
extra layer of water which blocks the
 

1119
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,630
extra layer of water which blocks the
view a little bit but overall it's

1120
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:27,640
view a little bit but overall it's
 

1121
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,160
view a little bit but overall it's
pretty good we can see to our left and

1122
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,170
pretty good we can see to our left and
 

1123
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,160
pretty good we can see to our left and
our rights very clearly up and downs a

1124
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,170
our rights very clearly up and downs a
 

1125
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,680
our rights very clearly up and downs a
little bit more obscured but you can

1126
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:34,690
little bit more obscured but you can
 

1127
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,420
little bit more obscured but you can
still see like the mountains outside the

1128
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,430
still see like the mountains outside the
 

1129
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,960
still see like the mountains outside the
water so it's it's not bad and we can

1130
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:39,970
water so it's it's not bad and we can
 

1131
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,460
water so it's it's not bad and we can
breathe because we're inside the slab ah

1132
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,470
breathe because we're inside the slab ah
 

1133
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,050
breathe because we're inside the slab ah
it's really hard to keep it straight

1134
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,060
it's really hard to keep it straight
 

1135
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,990
it's really hard to keep it straight
though I'm finding so you need some sort

1136
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,000
though I'm finding so you need some sort
 

1137
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,410
though I'm finding so you need some sort
of launching an alignment stuff

1138
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:54,420

 

1139
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,110

otherwise it's pretty tough alright umm

1140
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,120
otherwise it's pretty tough alright umm
 

1141

wrong way - it's really annoying and it
doesn't turn on a dime so if you hit

1146
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
doesn't turn on a dime so if you hit
 

1147
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,790
doesn't turn on a dime so if you hit
left or right it'll actually push you

1148
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:08,800
left or right it'll actually push you
 

1149
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,170
left or right it'll actually push you
forward a little bit and you get knocked

record on another computer I'd have to
 

1211
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,220
