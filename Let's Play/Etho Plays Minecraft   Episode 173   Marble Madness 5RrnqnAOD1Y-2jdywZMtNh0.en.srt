episode i wasted a lot of time talking
and we really didn't get much done

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
and we really didn't get much done
 

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,910
and we really didn't get much done
uh so

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920

 

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,910

it's a creeper in my wiring um

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
it's a creeper in my wiring um
 

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,589
it's a creeper in my wiring um
just before i started recording actually

14
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
just before i started recording actually
 

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,669
just before i started recording actually
accidentally pressed right click on my

16
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
accidentally pressed right click on my
 

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,229
accidentally pressed right click on my
mouse when i had a torch in my hand and

18
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
mouse when i had a torch in my hand and
 

19
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,670
mouse when i had a torch in my hand and

idea no idea
 

25
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,110
idea no idea
so that was a shock got the glass floor

26
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
so that was a shock got the glass floor
 

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,310
so that was a shock got the glass floor
done here

28
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
done here
 

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,549
done here
and just to begin with i wanted to kind

30
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
and just to begin with i wanted to kind
 

31
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,549
and just to begin with i wanted to kind
of make this room look

32
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
of make this room look
 

33
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,830
of make this room look
better or to like do the walls you know

34
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
better or to like do the walls you know
 

35
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,229
better or to like do the walls you know
so it's not all cobble

36
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
so it's not all cobble
 

37
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,310
so it's not all cobble
so i kind of planned out what i want to

38
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
so i kind of planned out what i want to
 

39
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,069
so i kind of planned out what i want to
do i came up with these four by four

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
do i came up with these four by four
 

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,029
do i came up with these four by four
tiles that i'm going to put across out

42
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
tiles that i'm going to put across out
 

43
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,990
tiles that i'm going to put across out
of stairs

44
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
of stairs
 

45
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,149
of stairs
and i'll probably have a line of

46
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
and i'll probably have a line of
 

47
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,469
and i'll probably have a line of
something here

48
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
something here
 

49
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,469
something here
then one two three four and then another

50
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
then one two three four and then another
 

51
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,149
then one two three four and then another
line is something at the last level

52
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
line is something at the last level
 

53
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,230
line is something at the last level
there

54
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
there
 

55
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,109
there
is my plan and the line of something

56
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
is my plan and the line of something
 

57
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,510
is my plan and the line of something
i think i'm going to do like the the

58
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
i think i'm going to do like the the
 

59
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,390
i think i'm going to do like the the
marble

60
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
marble
 

61
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,310
marble
look and see how that goes so i brought

62
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
look and see how that goes so i brought
 

63
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,030
look and see how that goes so i brought
some

64
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
some
 

65
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,149
some
dark wood and some light wood and we're

66
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
dark wood and some light wood and we're
 

67
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,910
dark wood and some light wood and we're
just gonna put it across see how it

68
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
just gonna put it across see how it
 

69
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,390
just gonna put it across see how it
looks

70
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
looks
 

71
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,149
looks
to begin with and i think i want the

72
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
to begin with and i think i want the
 

73
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,190
to begin with and i think i want the
outside to be white i counted it

74
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
outside to be white i counted it
 

75
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,870
outside to be white i counted it
and it should

76
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
and it should
 

77
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,990
and it should
work out pretty good like this yeah so

78
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
work out pretty good like this yeah so
 

79
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,630
work out pretty good like this yeah so
four white and three dark

00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439

 

85
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,990

kind of like that and along the wall

86
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000

 

87
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,990

this thing still hasn't actually no it

88
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
this thing still hasn't actually no it
 

89
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,670
this thing still hasn't actually no it
jammed once on me

90
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
jammed once on me
 

91
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,830
jammed once on me
um i think i know how to fix it though

92
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840

 

93
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,750

so i'm not too worried i still need to

94
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
so i'm not too worried i still need to
 

95
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,589
so i'm not too worried i still need to
tinker with the the wiring there

96
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
tinker with the the wiring there
 

97
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,390
tinker with the the wiring there
make it perfect yet

98
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400

 

99
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,150

but overall it's still running really

100
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
but overall it's still running really
 

101
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,270
but overall it's still running really
well can i put one more

102
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280

 

103
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,710

so we'll do that first well let's

104
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
so we'll do that first well let's
 

105
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,630
so we'll do that first well let's
go down below that better be the same

106
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
go down below that better be the same
 

107
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,229
go down below that better be the same
guy

108
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239

 

109
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,150

yeah that's kind of cool i like that

110
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160

 

111
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,509

113
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,270

oh man he almost blew up

114
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280

 

115
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,790

you guys are so hard to

116
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
you guys are so hard to
 

117
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,430
you guys are so hard to
predict now and he's gone he took off

118
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440

 

119
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,509

ah okay so we're gonna do another line

120
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
ah okay so we're gonna do another line
 

121
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,030
ah okay so we're gonna do another line
like that

122
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
like that
 

123
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,309
like that
at this level i don't know

124
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
at this level i don't know
 

125
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,309
at this level i don't know
if we should like have the blacks in the

126
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
if we should like have the blacks in the
 

127
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,910
if we should like have the blacks in the
same place and then

128
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
same place and then
 

129
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,270
same place and then
like black white black white or if we

130
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
like black white black white or if we
 

131
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,390
like black white black white or if we
should alternate them

132
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400

 

133
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,149

it would match the floor if we did black

134
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
it would match the floor if we did black
 

135
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,190
it would match the floor if we did black
and over here

136
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200

 

137
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:44,949

let's just see what it looks like

138
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959

 

139
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,910

hmm yeah yeah i think we'll do it that

140
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
hmm yeah yeah i think we'll do it that
 

141
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,229
hmm yeah yeah i think we'll do it that
way

142
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
way
 

143
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,750
way
so i'll finish that and then we'll get

144
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
so i'll finish that and then we'll get
 

145
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,509
so i'll finish that and then we'll get
back to this oh no

146
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
back to this oh no
 

147
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,789
back to this oh no
yeah yeah that's right that's four

148
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
yeah yeah that's right that's four
 

149
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,470
yeah yeah that's right that's four
blocks in between okay all right there

150
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
blocks in between okay all right there
 

151
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,270
blocks in between okay all right there
it is

152
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
it is
 

153
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,190
it is
uh i cleared out the space in between

154
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
uh i cleared out the space in between
 

155
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,910
uh i cleared out the space in between
two so we can put our tiles in

156
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
two so we can put our tiles in
 

157
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,630
two so we can put our tiles in
and the tiles are four by four so four

158
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
and the tiles are four by four so four
 

159
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,110
and the tiles are four by four so four
high

160
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
high
 

161
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,309
high
and four wide and we have one

162
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
and four wide and we have one
 

163
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,350
and four wide and we have one
two three 4 5 6 7 8 9

164
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
two three 4 5 6 7 8 9
 

165
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,189
two three 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14

166
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
10 11 12 13 14
 

167
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,830
10 11 12 13 14
blocks there so we could fit three tiles

168
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
blocks there so we could fit three tiles
 

169
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,230
blocks there so we could fit three tiles
in and then have

170
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
in and then have
 

171
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,670
in and then have
a one wide border on both edges so

172
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
a one wide border on both edges so
 

173
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,710
a one wide border on both edges so
maybe we will make

174
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
maybe we will make
 

175
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,150
maybe we will make
those black the borders

176
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160

 

177
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,189

like that

178
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199

 

179
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,629

i think i clogged the hole where the

180
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
i think i clogged the hole where the
 

181
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,950
i think i clogged the hole where the
creeper came in i think it was up there

182
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
creeper came in i think it was up there
 

183
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,390
creeper came in i think it was up there
oh there's more where is he

184
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
oh there's more where is he

187
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,990
i bet you that's the same one i killed
two

188
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000

 

189
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,110

if he's one hit that's him yeah it is

190
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
if he's one hit that's him yeah it is
 

191
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,469
if he's one hit that's him yeah it is
okay

192
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479

 

193
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,830

all right i feel a lot to see for now

194
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

195
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,870

um

196
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
um
 

197
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,230
um
yeah we might have to break that up a

198
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
yeah we might have to break that up a
 

199
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
yeah we might have to break that up a
bit it looks a little bit

200
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
bit it looks a little bit
 

201
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,469
bit it looks a little bit
strong is that the right word strong

202
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
strong is that the right word strong
 

203
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,590
strong is that the right word strong
i don't know uh so

204
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
i don't know uh so
 

205
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,270
i don't know uh so
the the patterns i found require stairs

206
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
the the patterns i found require stairs
 

207
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,230
the the patterns i found require stairs
so we have

208
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
so we have
 

209
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,430
so we have
five texture options really and since

210
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
five texture options really and since
 

211
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,310
five texture options really and since
most this

212
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
most this
 

213
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,830
most this
room is wood i think i'll try the wood

214
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
room is wood i think i'll try the wood
 

215
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,830
room is wood i think i'll try the wood
one first i was maybe thinking do

216
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
one first i was maybe thinking do
 

217
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,189
one first i was maybe thinking do
another brick

218
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
another brick
 

219
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,070
another brick
but i don't know and basically we're

220
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
but i don't know and basically we're
 

221
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,909
but i don't know and basically we're
gonna go

222
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919

 

223
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,670

three like that three upside down like

224
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
three like that three upside down like
 

225
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,510
three like that three upside down like
that

226
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
that
 

227
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,350
that
and this way as well

228
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360

 

229
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,590

and then three over there

230
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
and then three over there
 

231
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,469
and then three over there
and that makes kind of like an o

232
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479

 

233
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:08,150

like that and then in the middle

234
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160

 

235
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,150

i think that's okay i don't know

236
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

237
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,749

maybe i should have had white over here

238
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
maybe i should have had white over here
 

239
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,629
maybe i should have had white over here
instead of black

240
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639

 

241
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,189

and then this goes

242
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199

 

243
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,790

we want it uh

244
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800

 

245
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,830

oh how do we do that

246
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840

 

247
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,950

we want it like this nope

248
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
we want it like this nope
 

249
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,189
we want it like this nope
that get placed the wrong way

250
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199

 

251
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,990

it's so hard to work high up placing

252
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
it's so hard to work high up placing
 

253
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,070
it's so hard to work high up placing
stairs like this

254
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080

 

255
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,510

like that that's what we want

256
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
like that that's what we want
 

257
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,710
like that that's what we want
and we'll have to get a little bit

258
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
and we'll have to get a little bit
 

259
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,710
and we'll have to get a little bit
higher for the next one

260
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720

 

261
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,830

like that and then

262
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

263
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,070

nope

264
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
nope
 

265
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,150
nope
uh there no ah this is tough

266
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
uh there no ah this is tough
 

267
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,710
uh there no ah this is tough
there and then there okay that's the

268
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
there and then there okay that's the
 

269
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,309
there and then there okay that's the
pattern that's the four by four tile

270
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
pattern that's the four by four tile
 

271
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,469
pattern that's the four by four tile
we're going to repeat

272
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
we're going to repeat
 

273
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,950
we're going to repeat
see how it looks

274
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
see how it looks
 

275
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,469
see how it looks
and then we'll put something behind it

276
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
and then we'll put something behind it
 

277
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,350
and then we'll put something behind it
too so it won't be cobble

278
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
too so it won't be cobble
 

279
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,350
too so it won't be cobble
um it doesn't look as good as i thought

280
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
um it doesn't look as good as i thought
 

281
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,870
um it doesn't look as good as i thought
it would i'm going to try another brick

282
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
it would i'm going to try another brick
 

283
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,830
it would i'm going to try another brick
instead

284
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
instead
 

285
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,670
instead
i would really like to use sandstone but

286
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
i would really like to use sandstone but
 

287
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,749
i would really like to use sandstone but
we don't have sandstone stairs

288
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759

 

289
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,950

so i'll replace that try again

290
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
so i'll replace that try again
 

291
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,870
so i'll replace that try again
and i'll be back

292
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880

 

293
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,110

okay well that's the nether brick there

294
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
okay well that's the nether brick there
 

295
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,270
okay well that's the nether brick there
i'm not happy with it either something

296
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
i'm not happy with it either something
 

297
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,909
i'm not happy with it either something
needs to change i'm not quite sure what

298
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
needs to change i'm not quite sure what
 

299
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,670
needs to change i'm not quite sure what
so i'll just uh

300
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
so i'll just uh
 

301
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,189
so i'll just uh
well i'll compare the two i'll look over

302
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
well i'll compare the two i'll look over
 

303
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,749
well i'll compare the two i'll look over
the video and see which i prefer

304
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
the video and see which i prefer
 

305
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,589
the video and see which i prefer
the only other options are brick

306
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
the only other options are brick
 

307
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,790
the only other options are brick
cobblestone or

308
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
cobblestone or
 

309
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,869
cobblestone or
stone brick for the pattern

310
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879

 

311
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,110

and i don't think those three would look

312
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
and i don't think those three would look
 

313
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,790
and i don't think those three would look
good so it's kind of between that

314
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
good so it's kind of between that
 

315
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,589
good so it's kind of between that
and wood

316
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599

 

317
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,189

but we'll have to maybe do something

318
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
but we'll have to maybe do something
 

319
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,469
but we'll have to maybe do something
else with this shape

320
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479

 

321
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,950

and we are back so this is what i decide

322
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
and we are back so this is what i decide
 

323
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,749
and we are back so this is what i decide
to go with

324
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
to go with
 

325
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,589
to go with
the wooden planks i think they look

326
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
the wooden planks i think they look
 

327
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,790
the wooden planks i think they look
better than the

328
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
better than the
 

329
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,710
better than the
nether brick and i changed up the way i

330
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
nether brick and i changed up the way i
 

331
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,830
nether brick and i changed up the way i
was going to do this before i was going

332
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
was going to do this before i was going
 

333
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,949
was going to do this before i was going
to have all the tiles

334
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
to have all the tiles
 

335
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,269
to have all the tiles
connected together but now i have them

336
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
connected together but now i have them
 

337
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,350
connected together but now i have them
inset one block

338
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
inset one block
 

339
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,190
inset one block
and we have these borders between them

340
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
and we have these borders between them
 

341
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,670
and we have these borders between them

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080

 

349
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,949

reach like that all the way up and have

350
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
reach like that all the way up and have
 

351
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,389
reach like that all the way up and have
those moved over

352
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
those moved over
 

353
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,310
those moved over
one block to the left and one block to

354
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
one block to the left and one block to
 

355
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,070
one block to the left and one block to
the right but

356
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
the right but
 

357
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,590
the right but
that just won't work with the shape of

358
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
that just won't work with the shape of
 

359
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,630
that just won't work with the shape of
this room or the size of it

360
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
this room or the size of it
 

361
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,509
this room or the size of it
so this is uh this is the way we're

362
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
so this is uh this is the way we're
 

363
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,870
so this is uh this is the way we're
going to do it now the only

364
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
going to do it now the only
 

365
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,630
going to do it now the only
issue i'm having with this or my only

366
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
issue i'm having with this or my only
 

367
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,670
issue i'm having with this or my only
dislike is it's dark

368
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
dislike is it's dark
 

369
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,630
dislike is it's dark
it's too dark up there now first of all

370
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
it's too dark up there now first of all
 

371
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,350
it's too dark up there now first of all
and with this marble

372
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
and with this marble
 

373
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,269
and with this marble
look we got going on it's not really

374
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
look we got going on it's not really
 

375
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,590
look we got going on it's not really
working either the middle one looks okay

376
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
working either the middle one looks okay
 

377
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,150
working either the middle one looks okay
but then the side ones don't look great

378
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
but then the side ones don't look great
 

379
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,710
but then the side ones don't look great
to me so what i think i'll do

380
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
to me so what i think i'll do
 

381
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,630
to me so what i think i'll do
is change this so that

382
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
is change this so that
 

383
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,070
is change this so that
that's a white one and we might change

384
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
that's a white one and we might change
 

385
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,630
that's a white one and we might change
that wooden plank the regular wooden

386
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
that wooden plank the regular wooden
 

387
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,949
that wooden plank the regular wooden
planks there with white wood

388
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
planks there with white wood
 

389
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,389
planks there with white wood
and we will make this dark

390
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399

 

391
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,990

and i missed like that

392
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000

 

393
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,509

and then over here put

394
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
and then over here put
 

395
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,910
and then over here put
a lamp turn it on

396
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
a lamp turn it on
 

397
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,230
a lamp turn it on
and also surely have at least one wooden

398
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
and also surely have at least one wooden
 

399
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,110
and also surely have at least one wooden
or white one up here oh wrong block

400
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
or white one up here oh wrong block
 

401
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,069
or white one up here oh wrong block
give me that back

402
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079

 

403
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,509

like that

404
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
like that
 

405
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,630
like that
oh and maybe uh make two

406
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
oh and maybe uh make two
 

407
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,069
oh and maybe uh make two
dark blocks there and then

408
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
dark blocks there and then
 

409
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,630
dark blocks there and then
repeat the pattern at the top so there

410
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
repeat the pattern at the top so there
 

411
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,750
repeat the pattern at the top so there
would be another lamp

412
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
would be another lamp
 

413
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,550
would be another lamp
at the top there and at the very top row

414
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
at the top there and at the very top row
 

415
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,230
at the top there and at the very top row
there i'm going to do these tiles again

416
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
there i'm going to do these tiles again
 

417
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,750
there i'm going to do these tiles again
but with a different pattern

418
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
but with a different pattern
 

419
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,190
but with a different pattern
another one i like and i think that will

420
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
another one i like and i think that will
 

421
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,790
another one i like and i think that will
look pretty cool and that will light it

422
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
look pretty cool and that will light it
 

423
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,990
look pretty cool and that will light it
up enough

424
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
up enough
 

425
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,670
up enough
then we just need to put something

426
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
then we just need to put something
 

427
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,430
then we just need to put something
behind there so we don't see gray

428
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
behind there so we don't see gray
 

429
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,949
behind there so we don't see gray
and i think it'll be pretty cool so

430
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
and i think it'll be pretty cool so
 

431
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,150
and i think it'll be pretty cool so
i will work on converting this again

432
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160

 

433
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,470

and there it is so that's the first

434
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
and there it is so that's the first
 

435
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,069
and there it is so that's the first
layer done here

436
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
layer done here
 

437
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,829
layer done here
and i'm i'm really happy with the way it

438
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
and i'm i'm really happy with the way it
 

439
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,750
and i'm i'm really happy with the way it
turned out i think it looks pretty good

440
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
turned out i think it looks pretty good
 

441
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,829
turned out i think it looks pretty good
it's a little bit busy i like a little

442
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
it's a little bit busy i like a little
 

443
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,590
it's a little bit busy i like a little
busy looking there's lots of different

444
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
busy looking there's lots of different
 

445
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,630
busy looking there's lots of different
shapes and whatnot

446
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
shapes and whatnot
 

447
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,389
shapes and whatnot
but i like it because most the stuff i

448
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
but i like it because most the stuff i
 

449
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,310
but i like it because most the stuff i
make is usually pretty plain so this is

450
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
make is usually pretty plain so this is
 

451
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,990
make is usually pretty plain so this is
a nice change

452
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
a nice change
 

453
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,750
a nice change
and the only other thing i really don't

454
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
and the only other thing i really don't
 

455
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,949
and the only other thing i really don't
like

456
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
like
 

457
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,870
like
not that i mind too much is the very

458
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
not that i mind too much is the very
 

459
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,509
not that i mind too much is the very
corners i would like to include

460
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
corners i would like to include
 

461
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,230
corners i would like to include
like a light there and a light there to

462
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
like a light there and a light there to
 

463
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,509
like a light there and a light there to
bounce out the look

464
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
bounce out the look
 

465
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,829
bounce out the look
but like i said with the width of the

466
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
but like i said with the width of the
 

467
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,430
but like i said with the width of the
room we needed it to be

468
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
room we needed it to be
 

469
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,990
room we needed it to be
two blocks wider for that to happen

470
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
two blocks wider for that to happen
 

471
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,269
two blocks wider for that to happen
which it just

472
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
which it just
 

473
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,710
which it just
isn't that big so not a big deal

474
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
isn't that big so not a big deal
 

475
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,509
isn't that big so not a big deal
and we will have to put in a detector in

476
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
and we will have to put in a detector in
 

477
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,110
and we will have to put in a detector in
one of these corners too probably that

478
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
one of these corners too probably that
 

479
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,550
one of these corners too probably that
one there

480
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
one there
 

481
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,110
one there
so we'll have to rip out a few of those

482
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
so we'll have to rip out a few of those
 

483
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,550
so we'll have to rip out a few of those
wood blocks anyway

484
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
wood blocks anyway
 

485
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,190
wood blocks anyway
just for the function of the room but i

486
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
just for the function of the room but i
 

487
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,230
just for the function of the room but i
think we can move up

488
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
think we can move up
 

489
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,910
think we can move up
to the top now and i'll show you the

490
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
to the top now and i'll show you the
 

491
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,190
to the top now and i'll show you the
pattern

492
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
pattern
 

493
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,910
pattern
i picked out for that it's amazing all

494
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
i picked out for that it's amazing all
 

495
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,990
i picked out for that it's amazing all
the different uh

496
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
the different uh
 

497
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,350
the different uh
patterns you can do with these stairs

498
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
patterns you can do with these stairs
 

499
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,470
patterns you can do with these stairs
now that you can put them upside down

500
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480

 

501
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,750

all right oh

502
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
all right oh
 

503
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,829
all right oh
so again it'll be much the same

504
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839

 

505
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,670

oh

506
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
oh
 

507
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,110
oh
wait a minute i guess i gotta

508
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
wait a minute i guess i gotta
 

509
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,310
wait a minute i guess i gotta
raise the roof raise the roof one more

510
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
raise the roof raise the roof one more
 

511
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,829
raise the roof raise the roof one more
block

512
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
block
 

513
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,870
block
okay i'll be right back okay this is

514
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
okay i'll be right back okay this is
 

515
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,990
okay i'll be right back okay this is
really weird

516
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
really weird
 

517
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,550
really weird
this is really really weird i came back

518
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
this is really really weird i came back
 

519
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,230
this is really really weird i came back
here to get some supplies right

520
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
here to get some supplies right
 

521
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,910
here to get some supplies right
and i was jumping around took some

522
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
and i was jumping around took some
 

523
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,269
and i was jumping around took some
damage

524
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
damage
 

525
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,670
damage
didn't think much of it but for some

526
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
didn't think much of it but for some
 

527
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,430
didn't think much of it but for some
reason now i have the ability to

528
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
reason now i have the ability to
 

529
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,790
reason now i have the ability to
pass through blocks

530
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800

 

531
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,990

very strangely i can't even jump out of

532
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
very strangely i can't even jump out of
 

533
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,629
very strangely i can't even jump out of
this water

534
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
this water
 

535
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,310
this water
i think the game thinks i'm lower than i

536
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
i think the game thinks i'm lower than i
 

537
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,750
i think the game thinks i'm lower than i
actually am or something

538
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
actually am or something
 

539
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,190
actually am or something
so like if i jump my head goes into that

540
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
so like if i jump my head goes into that
 

541
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,670
so like if i jump my head goes into that
block

542
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
block
 

543
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,069
block
or if i run into this tree

544
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
or if i run into this tree
 

545
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,750
or if i run into this tree
the leaves don't stop me i can run

546
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
the leaves don't stop me i can run
 

547
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,590
the leaves don't stop me i can run
through the

548
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600

 

549
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,190

a little bit so weird

550
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200

 

551
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,190

what the heck

552
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200

 

553
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,990

okay my y coordinate says i'm at .62 i

554
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
okay my y coordinate says i'm at .62 i
 

555
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,750
okay my y coordinate says i'm at .62 i
wonder if that's normal i'll have to uh

556
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
wonder if that's normal i'll have to uh
 

557
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,509
wonder if that's normal i'll have to uh
oh whatever class does

558
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519

 

559
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,750

can i run into this

560
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760

 

561
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,310

kind of i almost did it [ __ ] if i had a

562
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
kind of i almost did it [ __ ] if i had a
 

563
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,829
kind of i almost did it [ __ ] if i had a
block down i could do it

564
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839

 

565
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:59,189

nope not letting me what about

566
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199

 

567
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,030

oh that's so weird

568
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
oh that's so weird
 

569
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,470
oh that's so weird
yeah it thinks that it must think i'm

570
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
yeah it thinks that it must think i'm
 

571
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,389
yeah it thinks that it must think i'm
one block lower than i actually am

572
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399

 

573
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,310

okay enough goofing around i'm gonna

574
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
okay enough goofing around i'm gonna
 

575
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,189
okay enough goofing around i'm gonna
re-log and see if that fixes it

576
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
re-log and see if that fixes it
 

577
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,829
re-log and see if that fixes it
okay it's fixed my height is the same

578
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
okay it's fixed my height is the same
 

579
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,870
okay it's fixed my height is the same
though so that wasn't

580
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
though so that wasn't
 

581
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,670
though so that wasn't
the issue something got messed up in the

582
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
the issue something got messed up in the
 

583
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,710
the issue something got messed up in the
game code

584
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720

 

585
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,509

okay so i got this uh upper layer

586
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
okay so i got this uh upper layer
 

587
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,030
okay so i got this uh upper layer
already all prepped

588
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
already all prepped
 

589
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,110
already all prepped
we can start building it should go

590
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
we can start building it should go
 

591
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,430
we can start building it should go
really quick because it's uh

592
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
really quick because it's uh
 

593
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,350
really quick because it's uh
pretty much exact same as that lower

594
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
pretty much exact same as that lower
 

595
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,790
pretty much exact same as that lower
thing over there so we just need to

596
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
thing over there so we just need to
 

597
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,389
thing over there so we just need to
replicate it

598
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
replicate it
 

599
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,949
replicate it
uh just a different four by four tile

600
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
uh just a different four by four tile
 

601
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,790
uh just a different four by four tile
pattern we're going to be doing

602
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
pattern we're going to be doing
 

603
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,829
pattern we're going to be doing
so we will continue

604
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
so we will continue
 

605
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,110
so we will continue
the dark wood in the middle like that

606
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120

 

607
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,870

and actually in the middle over here as

608
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
and actually in the middle over here as
 

609
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,629
and actually in the middle over here as
well we will have

610
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
well we will have
 

611
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,670
well we will have
lamps at the very top too like one there

612
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
lamps at the very top too like one there
 

613
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,710
lamps at the very top too like one there
and the white wood and the way i've been

614
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
and the white wood and the way i've been
 

615
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,829
and the white wood and the way i've been
powering these lamps is i've just been

616
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
powering these lamps is i've just been
 

617
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,030
powering these lamps is i've just been
putting

618
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
putting
 

619
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,629
putting
levers behind them and turning them on

620
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639

 

621
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,069

like so let's see how much light does

622
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
like so let's see how much light does
 

623
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,829
like so let's see how much light does
that give

624
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
that give
 

625
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,870
that give
yeah it looks pretty good we have block

626
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
yeah it looks pretty good we have block
 

627
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,269
yeah it looks pretty good we have block
light

628
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
light
 

629
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,389
light
5 6 9 10 11 12

630
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399

 

631
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,150

10 yeah yeah it's pretty good

632
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
10 yeah yeah it's pretty good
 

633
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,990
10 yeah yeah it's pretty good
as long as stuff doesn't spawn that's my

634
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
as long as stuff doesn't spawn that's my
 

635
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,590
as long as stuff doesn't spawn that's my
only concern and they won't because we

636
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
only concern and they won't because we
 

637
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,030
only concern and they won't because we
got glass here so it doesn't really

638
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
got glass here so it doesn't really
 

639
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,069
got glass here so it doesn't really
matter

640
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079

 

641
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,150

we'll do that the corners go like this

642
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160

 

643
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,670

all right very good

644
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680

 

645
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,749

and i'm gonna put a tile here too even

646
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
and i'm gonna put a tile here too even
 

647
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,509
and i'm gonna put a tile here too even
though i don't think we have one below

648
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
though i don't think we have one below
 

649
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:05,030
though i don't think we have one below
but that might change yet i'm not sure

650
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040

 

651
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,470

let's see okay anyway you get the point

652
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
let's see okay anyway you get the point
 

653
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,949
let's see okay anyway you get the point
so the tile pattern we're doing for this

654
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
so the tile pattern we're doing for this
 

655
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,269
so the tile pattern we're doing for this
is much the same as that one we still do

656
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
is much the same as that one we still do
 

657
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,030
is much the same as that one we still do
the three stairs

658
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
the three stairs
 

659
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,990
the three stairs
facing the same way in the corner but

660
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
facing the same way in the corner but
 

661
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,710
facing the same way in the corner but
instead of

662
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
instead of
 

663
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,150
instead of
the upside down stair facing

664
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
the upside down stair facing
 

665
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,829
the upside down stair facing
this way we will just do another one of

666
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
this way we will just do another one of
 

667
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,310
this way we will just do another one of
these

668
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
these
 

669
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,670
these
like that do that for all four corners

670
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680

 

671
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,430

and it looks pretty good i like this

672
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
and it looks pretty good i like this
 

673
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,269
and it looks pretty good i like this
pattern too quite a bit

674
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279

 

675
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:49,110

so we got the grid very simple

676
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120

 

677
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,590

there we go so like i said we just have

678
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
there we go so like i said we just have
 

679
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,030
there we go so like i said we just have
to change the gray behind it because i

680
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
to change the gray behind it because i
 

681
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,550
to change the gray behind it because i
don't want it to be gray we might put

682
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
don't want it to be gray we might put
 

683
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,550
don't want it to be gray we might put
leaves or some lighting or something i

684
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
leaves or some lighting or something i
 

685
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,389
leaves or some lighting or something i
don't know

686
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399

for digging i think that's going to be

708
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
for digging i think that's going to be
 

709
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,230
for digging i think that's going to be
really cool when i get it working

710
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
really cool when i get it working
 

711

the base so i need to go back

722
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
the base so i need to go back
 

723
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,870

and i want to show you i got a portal
here now i was just curious to see

726
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
here now i was just curious to see
 

727
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,029
here now i was just curious to see
where it would take me if i made one

728
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039

 

729
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,950

and surprise surprise it links up with

730
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
and surprise surprise it links up with
 

731
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,630
and surprise surprise it links up with
the other portal the nether the other

732
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
the other portal the nether the other
 

733
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,669
the other portal the nether the other
one i was using

734
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679

 

735
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,230

you can see the tree over there still so

736
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
you can see the tree over there still so
 

737
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,669
you can see the tree over there still so
if we go through this again

738
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
if we go through this again
 

739
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,750
if we go through this again
it takes us to the portal in the middle

740
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
it takes us to the portal in the middle
 

741
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,350
it takes us to the portal in the middle
of the field

742
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
of the field
 

743
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,750
of the field
so

744
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760

 

745
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,669

i think it does that because i've heard

746
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
i think it does that because i've heard
 

747
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,110
i think it does that because i've heard
you need to make them a thousand blocks

748
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
you need to make them a thousand blocks
 

749
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,390
you need to make them a thousand blocks
apart to prevent that

750
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
apart to prevent that
 

751
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,350
apart to prevent that
or else make the portal from in the

752
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
or else make the portal from in the
 

753
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,990
or else make the portal from in the
nether not

754
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
nether not
 

755
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,830
nether not
from the overworld here overworld

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960

 

767
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,110

all right so we got that done

768
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120

 

769
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,950

it looks pretty good let's check it out

770
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
it looks pretty good let's check it out
 

771
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,350
it looks pretty good let's check it out
from below

772
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
from below
 

773
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,390
from below
actually we'll take a look from above to

774
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400

 

775
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,590

kind of get a feel of how to look um

776
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
kind of get a feel of how to look um
 

777
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,510
kind of get a feel of how to look um
now from below

778
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520

 

779
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,510

oh

780
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520

 

781
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,390

yeah the void fog is kind of blocking

782
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
yeah the void fog is kind of blocking
 

783
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,310
yeah the void fog is kind of blocking
the vision a little bit because we're at

784
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
the vision a little bit because we're at
 

785
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,990
the vision a little bit because we're at
11 here

786
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
11 here
 

787
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,590
11 here
all right well i'm pretty happy with

788
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
all right well i'm pretty happy with
 

789
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,590
all right well i'm pretty happy with
that the only thing we

790
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
that the only thing we
 

791
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,870
that the only thing we
should maybe do yet is the ceiling

792
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
should maybe do yet is the ceiling
 

793
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,630
should maybe do yet is the ceiling
i didn't really plan what i want to do

794
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
i didn't really plan what i want to do
 

795
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,350
i didn't really plan what i want to do
with that

796
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
with that
 

797
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,070
with that
i was thinking of trying like a stair

798
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
i was thinking of trying like a stair
 

799
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,150
i was thinking of trying like a stair
rim

800
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
rim
 

801
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,710
rim
around it so um

802
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
around it so um
 

803
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,909
around it so um
maybe you can pick here

804
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919

 

805
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,470

and do upside down stairs

806
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
and do upside down stairs
 

807
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,990
and do upside down stairs
like that all the way around

808
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
like that all the way around
 

809
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,350
like that all the way around
and then at certain sections maybe have

810
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
and then at certain sections maybe have
 

811
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,990
and then at certain sections maybe have
a grid type thing so like where this

812
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
a grid type thing so like where this
 

813
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,029
a grid type thing so like where this
this post is or whatever uh we need to

814
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
this post is or whatever uh we need to
 

815
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,990
this post is or whatever uh we need to
have

816
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
have
 

817
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,510
have
we need a half slabs for this

818
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
we need a half slabs for this
 

819
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,909
we need a half slabs for this
get some half slabs

820
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919

 

821
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,909

yeah this project's quite a bit of work

822
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
yeah this project's quite a bit of work
 

823
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,310
yeah this project's quite a bit of work
really

824
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320

 

825
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,750

okay we'll try like this and those will

826
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
okay we'll try like this and those will
 

827
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,789
okay we'll try like this and those will
connect every four by four area probably

828
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
connect every four by four area probably
 

829
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,549
connect every four by four area probably
oh that's where there's a hollow space

830
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
oh that's where there's a hollow space
 

831
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:50,070
oh that's where there's a hollow space
under the stairs i didn't know that

832
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080

 

833
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,870

so it would go

834
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880

 

835
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,990

um let's see we would make this

836
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
um let's see we would make this
 

837
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,710
um let's see we would make this
go like that way like we'll have cross

838
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
go like that way like we'll have cross
 

839
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,590
go like that way like we'll have cross
sections that join up

840
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
sections that join up
 

841
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,470
sections that join up
at each of these posts going that way

842
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
at each of these posts going that way
 

843
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,350
at each of these posts going that way
and then another one

844
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
and then another one
 

845
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,430
and then another one
over here and then going this way here

846
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
over here and then going this way here
 

847
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,029
over here and then going this way here
and this way and that'll leave a four by

848
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
and this way and that'll leave a four by
 

849
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,430
and this way and that'll leave a four by
four

850
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
four
 

851
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,390
four
area on top and we might sneak some

852
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
area on top and we might sneak some
 

853
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,230
area on top and we might sneak some
lighting in there

854
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
lighting in there
 

855
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,190
lighting in there
and maybe the marble look i don't know

856
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200

 

857
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,510

let me let me work on this a bit and

858
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
let me let me work on this a bit and
 

859
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,909
let me let me work on this a bit and
we'll see how it looks

860
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919

 

861
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,430

hmm that's the grid

862
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
hmm that's the grid
 

863
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,430
hmm that's the grid
what do you think how does that look

864
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440

 

865
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,029

makes it feel really open in here that's

866
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
makes it feel really open in here that's
 

867
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,590
makes it feel really open in here that's
a pretty high ceiling

868
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
a pretty high ceiling
 

869
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,750
a pretty high ceiling
the gray would obviously be something

870
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
the gray would obviously be something
 

871
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,470
the gray would obviously be something
else i'm not sure what

872
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
else i'm not sure what
 

873
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,750
else i'm not sure what
um if we do go with this i can get rid

874
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
um if we do go with this i can get rid
 

875
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,149
um if we do go with this i can get rid
of this darkness on the stairs there

876
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
of this darkness on the stairs there
 

877
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,430
of this darkness on the stairs there
i think by removing a block behind it or

878
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
i think by removing a block behind it or
 

879
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,990
i think by removing a block behind it or
something

880
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
something
 

881
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,350
something
should fix that and

882
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
should fix that and
 

883
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,070
should fix that and
with this grid this corn the corner

884
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
with this grid this corn the corner
 

885
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,950
with this grid this corn the corner
pieces are three by three there

886
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
pieces are three by three there
 

887
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,630
pieces are three by three there
and then the sides are four by three

888
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
and then the sides are four by three
 

889
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,430
and then the sides are four by three
and the middle is a four by four so

890
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
and the middle is a four by four so
 

891
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,549
and the middle is a four by four so
that's the pattern

892
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
that's the pattern
 

893
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,789
that's the pattern
which is fitting i would say because it

894
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
which is fitting i would say because it
 

895
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,310
which is fitting i would say because it
kind of matches this pattern

896
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
kind of matches this pattern
 

897
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,190
kind of matches this pattern
where the corners are small and those

898
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
where the corners are small and those
 

899
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,630
where the corners are small and those
are wide and then big

900
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
are wide and then big
 

901
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,549
are wide and then big
type thing

902
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559

 

903
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,390

actually you know one thing we could do

904
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
actually you know one thing we could do
 

905
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,909
actually you know one thing we could do
like i kind of want to incorporate some

906
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
like i kind of want to incorporate some
 

907
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,070
like i kind of want to incorporate some
lighting in the ceiling too because

908
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
lighting in the ceiling too because
 

909
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,830
lighting in the ceiling too because
the middle of this looks really dark the

910
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
the middle of this looks really dark the
 

911
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,470
the middle of this looks really dark the
glass

912
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
glass
 

913
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,990
glass
and it would brighten up the room i

914
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
and it would brighten up the room i
 

915
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,789
and it would brighten up the room i
think we could maybe

916
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799

 

917
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,750

take that out

918
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760

 

919
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,149

and like put a lamp there actually let's

920
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
and like put a lamp there actually let's
 

921
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,909
and like put a lamp there actually let's
try it on this one

922
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919

 

923
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,470

like have a lamp but instead doing

924
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
like have a lamp but instead doing
 

925
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,510
like have a lamp but instead doing
straight like that

926
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
straight like that
 

927
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,830
straight like that
maybe switch this out with a stair

928
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
maybe switch this out with a stair
 

929
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,190
maybe switch this out with a stair
type thing

930
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200

 

931
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,990

give it a little more shape and have

932
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
give it a little more shape and have
 

933
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,950
give it a little more shape and have
four of those one

934
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
four of those one
 

935
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,430
four of those one
one in each of those and let's see if we

936
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
one in each of those and let's see if we
 

937
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,149
one in each of those and let's see if we
can get

938
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
can get
 

939
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,470
can get
it lit i don't know if i'll be able to

940
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
it lit i don't know if i'll be able to
 

941
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,909
it lit i don't know if i'll be able to
find that

942
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
find that
 

943
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,190
find that
actually let's let's get the coordinate

944
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
actually let's let's get the coordinate
 

945
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,630
actually let's let's get the coordinate
that is 447 and 862.

946
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
that is 447 and 862.
 

947
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,710
that is 447 and 862.
447 862 447 862.

948
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720

 

949
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,310

this place is a mess i gotta move these

950
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
this place is a mess i gotta move these
 

951
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,269
this place is a mess i gotta move these
chests

952
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279

 

953
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,789

four 47.

954
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
four 47.
 

955
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,230
four 47.
no too far 862. we're really close

956
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
no too far 862. we're really close
 

957
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,990
no too far 862. we're really close
right down there okay

958
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000

 

959
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,470

so we'll light that up

960
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480

 

961
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,630

and just block this so we don't get mobs

962
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
and just block this so we don't get mobs
 

963
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,070
and just block this so we don't get mobs
although i'm pretty sure this isn't

964
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
although i'm pretty sure this isn't
 

965
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,029
although i'm pretty sure this isn't
safe anymore my little work area here

966
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039

 

967
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,590

after all these adjustments

968
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600

 

969
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,190

actually have a way to turn it off until

1020
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
actually have a way to turn it off until
 

1021
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,070
actually have a way to turn it off until
it just runs out

1022
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
it just runs out
 

1023
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,470
it just runs out
why would you want to turn it off

1024
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480

 

1025

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,630

for doing what it's not actually

1028
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
for doing what it's not actually
 

1029
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,549
for doing what it's not actually
