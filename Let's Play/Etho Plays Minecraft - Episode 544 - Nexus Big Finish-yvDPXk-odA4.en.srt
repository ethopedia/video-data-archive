00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,560
here let's go see the finishing touches
that were made to the the Nexus build

54
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,570
that were made to the the Nexus build
 

55
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,109

here first off this window used to only

56
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
here first off this window used to only
 

57
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,240
here first off this window used to only
be about a block or two tall now we

58
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,250
be about a block or two tall now we
 

59
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,800
be about a block or two tall now we
built the frame up and it connects to

60
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:18,810
built the frame up and it connects to
 

61
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,230
built the frame up and it connects to
the second layer here and also the glass

62
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
the second layer here and also the glass
 

63
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,649
the second layer here and also the glass
goes up and kind of domes over here so

64
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:24,659
goes up and kind of domes over here so
 

65
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,090
goes up and kind of domes over here so
now they actually get to the second

66
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,100
now they actually get to the second
 

67
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,130
now they actually get to the second
layer you have to take these up bubble

68
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,140
layer you have to take these up bubble
 

69
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,560

that redstone kind of wish I built that
 

115
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,430

time ago and that was the way I always
 

121
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,850
time ago and that was the way I always
did the redstone back then so we come

122
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:26,860
did the redstone back then so we come
 

123
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,260
did the redstone back then so we come
out on the other side here and again the

124
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,270
out on the other side here and again the
 

125

is a tunnel down on the lower level as

130
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:35,560
is a tunnel down on the lower level as
 

131
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,670
is a tunnel down on the lower level as
well that we can walk across to to get

132
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,680
well that we can walk across to to get
 

133
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,130
well that we can walk across to to get
to the other side the water streams had

134
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,140
to the other side the water streams had
 

135
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,080
to the other side the water streams had
to be moved to build these tunnels they

136
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,090
to be moved to build these tunnels they
 

137
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,970
to be moved to build these tunnels they
were kind of in the way before some

138
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:44,980
were kind of in the way before some
 

139
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,160
were kind of in the way before some
things also got added or changed to the

140
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,170
things also got added or changed to the
 

141
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,050
things also got added or changed to the
exterior of the Nexus one of the big

142
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,060
exterior of the Nexus one of the big
 

143
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,490
exterior of the Nexus one of the big
ones that got added was these stone

144
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,500
ones that got added was these stone
 

145
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,830
ones that got added was these stone
slabs around the whole area here we also

146
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:52,840
slabs around the whole area here we also
 

147
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,720
slabs around the whole area here we also
got them on the lower section now as

148
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:54,730
got them on the lower section now as
 

149
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,270
got them on the lower section now as
well it used to transitions straight

150
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
well it used to transitions straight
 

151
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,770
well it used to transitions straight
from the light blue here to the dark

152
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:58,780
from the light blue here to the dark
 

153
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,880
from the light blue here to the dark
gray and now we kind of have an

154
00:02:59,880 --> 00:02:59,890
gray and now we kind of have an
 

155
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,190
gray and now we kind of have an
in-between material and I think that

156
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
in-between material and I think that
 

157
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,110
in-between material and I think that
looks a lot better especially when

158
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
looks a lot better especially when
 

159
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,310
looks a lot better especially when
you're coming in from a distance you can

160
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,320
you're coming in from a distance you can
 

161
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,980
you're coming in from a distance you can
really notice that we have like a white

162
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:07,990

296
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
lighting issues which we're gonna try to
 

297
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,409
lighting issues which we're gonna try to
fix because when we first built this

298
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:42,419
fix because when we first built this
 

299
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,300

where like if you put a light next to
them they would acquire that light power

304
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,150
them they would acquire that light power
 

305
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,770
them they would acquire that light power
even after you removed it but now they

306
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:51,780
even after you removed it but now they
 

307
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,600

lighting a five over here so that's

310
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:55,830
lighting a five over here so that's
 

311
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,529
lighting a five over here so that's
pretty dark we'll stick a shroom light

312
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:57,539
pretty dark we'll stick a shroom light
 

313
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,600
pretty dark we'll stick a shroom light
behind and then glass in the front maybe

314
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,610
behind and then glass in the front maybe
 

315
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,430
behind and then glass in the front maybe
so that should light up this whole

316
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
so that should light up this whole
 

317
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,930
so that should light up this whole

corners if we check it out it says it's

322
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:06,690
corners if we check it out it says it's
 

323
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,399
corners if we check it out it says it's
a block level of six so I think we'll

324
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,409
a block level of six so I think we'll
 

325
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,969
a block level of six so I think we'll
put a light over here I feel like we got

326
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:13,979
put a light over here I feel like we got
 

327
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,710
put a light over here I feel like we got
so many lights spammed in here and

328
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
so many lights spammed in here and
 

329
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,450
so many lights spammed in here and
there's still so many dark spots so I

330
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,460
there's still so many dark spots so I
 

331
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,300
there's still so many dark spots so I
discovered between the two lanterns

332
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,310
discovered between the two lanterns
 

333
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,790
discovered between the two lanterns
there's actually a dark spot light level

334
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
there's actually a dark spot light level
 

335
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,129
there's actually a dark spot light level
is seven over here and the only way I

336
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:25,139
is seven over here and the only way I
 

337
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,149
is seven over here and the only way I
can think of getting rid of that is

338
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:26,159
can think of getting rid of that is
 

339
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,149
can think of getting rid of that is
either to lower these by one which I

340
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:29,159
either to lower these by one which I
 

341
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,040
either to lower these by one which I
don't think will look very good

342
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,050
don't think will look very good
 

343
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,080
don't think will look very good
all right yeah that looks horrible so I

344
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,090
all right yeah that looks horrible so I
 

345
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,820
all right yeah that looks horrible so I
think what we're going to do is Gary the

346
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:38,830
think what we're going to do is Gary the
 

347
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,580
think what we're going to do is Gary the
lanterns and maybe I'd some shroom

348
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:41,590
lanterns and maybe I'd some shroom
 

349
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,320
lanterns and maybe I'd some shroom
lights down like this and then put us

350
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,330
lights down like this and then put us
 

351
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,499
lights down like this and then put us
there on top the light will shine

352
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:46,509
there on top the light will shine
 

353
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,510
there on top the light will shine
through it's orange so it'll kind of

354
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:48,520
through it's orange so it'll kind of
 

355
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,999
through it's orange so it'll kind of
match the orange here okay so I think we

356
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:51,009
match the orange here okay so I think we
 

357
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,499
match the orange here okay so I think we
pretty much got it all lit up now we

358
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:52,509
pretty much got it all lit up now we
 

359
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,450
pretty much got it all lit up now we
even got rid of some of the lanterns but

360
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:54,460
even got rid of some of the lanterns but
 

361
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,309
even got rid of some of the lanterns but
we did have to make a few compromises

362
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
we did have to make a few compromises
 

363
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,469
we did have to make a few compromises
here like I have to put this in I

364
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
here like I have to put this in I
 

365
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,939
here like I have to put this in I
wouldn't have liked to keep that

366
00:06:59,939 --> 00:06:59,949
wouldn't have liked to keep that
 

367
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,040
wouldn't have liked to keep that
netherwart blocks but we have a dark

368
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,050
netherwart blocks but we have a dark
 

369
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,260
netherwart blocks but we have a dark
spot here I had to deal with that also

370
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,270
spot here I had to deal with that also
 

371
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,379
spot here I had to deal with that also
some sneaky lighting over here yeah that

372
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:10,389
some sneaky lighting over here yeah that
 

373
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,480
some sneaky lighting over here yeah that
makes a huge difference doesn't it I

374
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,490
makes a huge difference doesn't it I
 

375
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,700
makes a huge difference doesn't it I
think I like it more though I do we

376
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:14,710
think I like it more though I do we
 

377
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,409
think I like it more though I do we
replace the yellow glass here with green

replace the yellow glass here with green
 

379
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,779
replace the yellow glass here with green

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:18,789
again like we used to have as well I
 

381
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,300
again like we used to have as well I
think what happened this path box came

382
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,310
think what happened this path box came
 

383
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,680
think what happened this path box came
out and whenever something new comes out

384
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:22,690
out and whenever something new comes out
 

385
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,089
out and whenever something new comes out
in this game I'm always like okay that's

386
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:24,099
in this game I'm always like okay that's
 

387
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,619
in this game I'm always like okay that's
the new best thing we got to use it

388
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:25,629
the new best thing we got to use it
 

389
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,420
the new best thing we got to use it
right so I I got rid of all the grass

391
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,640
right so I I got rid of all the grass
here and I don't think that was the

392
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:29,650
here and I don't think that was the
 

393
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,059
here and I don't think that was the
right call

394
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:30,069
right call
 

395
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,760
right call

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,750
here actually it was actually a bit of
building but I'm pretty happy with it

480
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
building but I'm pretty happy with it
 

481
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,630
building but I'm pretty happy with it
now so did a bit more work on this exits

482
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,640
now so did a bit more work on this exits
 

483
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,180
now so did a bit more work on this exits
at it some red nether brick up around

484
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,190
at it some red nether brick up around
 

485
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,420
at it some red nether brick up around
here more shroom lights more creepers we

486
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,430
here more shroom lights more creepers we
 

487
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,829
here more shroom lights more creepers we
used to only have two of these magma

488
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:36,839
used to only have two of these magma
 

489
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,410
used to only have two of these magma
things that went over and now I've added

490
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
things that went over and now I've added
 

491
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,180
things that went over and now I've added
a third one here that kind of goes half

492
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,190
a third one here that kind of goes half
 

493
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,130
a third one here that kind of goes half
over just to fill up the space a bit

494
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,140
over just to fill up the space a bit
 

495
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,050
over just to fill up the space a bit
more and it goes up to our very

496
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,060
more and it goes up to our very
 

497
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,530
more and it goes up to our very
dangerous swamp up here that was a close

498
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,540
dangerous swamp up here that was a close
 

499
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,260
dangerous swamp up here that was a close
one I actually didn't see that guy okay

500
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,270
one I actually didn't see that guy okay
 

501
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,150
one I actually didn't see that guy okay
and then over here where we actually

502
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,160
and then over here where we actually
 

503
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,010
and then over here where we actually
harvest the nether word it was all stone

504
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,020
harvest the nether word it was all stone
 

505
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,070
harvest the nether word it was all stone
before and now we got a bit of a nether

506
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
before and now we got a bit of a nether
 

507
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,370
before and now we got a bit of a nether
work red nether brick pattern right and

508
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,380
work red nether brick pattern right and
 

509
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,530
work red nether brick pattern right and
it's all lit up as well we got the

510
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:03,540
it's all lit up as well we got the
 

511
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,470
it's all lit up as well we got the
shroom lights again we only had two of

512
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
shroom lights again we only had two of
 

513
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,850
shroom lights again we only had two of
these magma things before and now I've

514
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:07,860
these magma things before and now I've
 

515
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,670
these magma things before and now I've
added some half ones that go up just to

516
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:10,680
added some half ones that go up just to
 

517
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,620
added some half ones that go up just to
fill in the space over here as well and

518
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:12,630
fill in the space over here as well and
 

519
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,840
fill in the space over here as well and
let's see if I broke any redstone while

520
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,850
let's see if I broke any redstone while
 

521
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,850
let's see if I broke any redstone while
doing this so it says press to harvest

522
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:18,860

 

523
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,220

dues oh I did actually break the

524
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,230
dues oh I did actually break the
 

525
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,620
dues oh I did actually break the
redstone burn it's supposed to come out

526
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,630
redstone burn it's supposed to come out
 

527
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,329
redstone burn it's supposed to come out
on all these but only this one worked

528
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:28,339
on all these but only this one worked
 

529
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,470
on all these but only this one worked
okay and we can shorten the time on that

530
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
okay and we can shorten the time on that
 

531
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,300
okay and we can shorten the time on that
water because now stuff travels a lot

532
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,310
water because now stuff travels a lot
 

533
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,819
water because now stuff travels a lot
faster to you okay I think we found it

534
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:34,829
faster to you okay I think we found it
 

535
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,160
faster to you okay I think we found it
here actually it looks like a redstone

536
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,170
here actually it looks like a redstone
 

537
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,490
here actually it looks like a redstone
repeater must've got broken okay and I

538
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:40,500
repeater must've got broken okay and I
 

539
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,600
repeater must've got broken okay and I
think every place do it with dust

540
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,610
think every place do it with dust
 

541
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,300
think every place do it with dust
instead that goes hopefully that that

542
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,310
instead that goes hopefully that that
 

543
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,130
instead that goes hopefully that that
did it I didn't hear any water buckets

544
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,140
did it I didn't hear any water buckets
 

545
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,329
did it I didn't hear any water buckets
but we might have been too far away

546
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:50,339
but we might have been too far away
 

547
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,180
but we might have been too far away
let's go check it out so now all that

548
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,190
let's go check it out so now all that
 

549
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,890
let's go check it out so now all that
nether work should have been harvested

550
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:54,900
nether work should have been harvested
 

551
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,889
nether work should have been harvested
yeah okay they did very good very good

552
00:10:59,889 --> 00:10:59,899
yeah okay they did very good very good
 

553
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,720
yeah okay they did very good very good
one of the very first projects we worked

554
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,730
one of the very first projects we worked
 

555
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,579
one of the very first projects we worked
on in this world and to this day is

556
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:04,589
on in this world and to this day is
 

557
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:07,189
on in this world and to this day is
still one of my favorites is the pop-up

558
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:07,199
still one of my favorites is the pop-up
 

559
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,769
still one of my favorites is the pop-up
sheep farm the cool thing about this

560
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:09,779
sheep farm the cool thing about this
 

561
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,629
sheep farm the cool thing about this
build is that use so many different game

562
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:11,639
build is that use so many different game
 

563
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,489
build is that use so many different game
mechanics and combine them all together

564
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:13,499
mechanics and combine them all together
 

565
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,889
mechanics and combine them all together
to make the farm work the problem with

566
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:15,899
to make the farm work the problem with
 

567
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,199
to make the farm work the problem with
that is it breaks every single updated

568
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,209
that is it breaks every single updated
 

569
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,970
that is it breaks every single updated
field it's broken again guys I'm not

570
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:19,980
field it's broken again guys I'm not
 

571
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,460
field it's broken again guys I'm not
sure why let's investigate together here

572
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,470
sure why let's investigate together here
 

573
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,439
sure why let's investigate together here
I see the sheep are stuck in the glass

574
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:24,449
I see the sheep are stuck in the glass
 

575
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:32,479
I see the sheep are stuck in the glass
and the piston extended okay so the

576
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,489
and the piston extended okay so the
 

577
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,280
and the piston extended okay so the
piston extended but the Sheep didn't go

578
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,290
piston extended but the Sheep didn't go
 

579
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,349
piston extended but the Sheep didn't go
up for some reason that is weird let's

580
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:39,359
up for some reason that is weird let's
 

581
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:43,299
up for some reason that is weird let's
see if we can manually get this gotta go

582
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:43,309
see if we can manually get this gotta go
 

583
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:48,289
see if we can manually get this gotta go
okay so that lowered it oh any wander

584
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:48,299
okay so that lowered it oh any wander
 

585
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,879
okay so that lowered it oh any wander
free oh no

586
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:49,889
free oh no
 

587
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,829
free oh no
why how he shouldn't have been able to

588
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
why how he shouldn't have been able to
 

589
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,150
why how he shouldn't have been able to
right cuz he would have been down here

590
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
right cuz he would have been down here
 

591
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,099
right cuz he would have been down here
and still been stuck in that glass block

592
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:58,109
and still been stuck in that glass block
 

593
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:01,220
and still been stuck in that glass block
yeah so we put a piston here get the

594
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,230
yeah so we put a piston here get the
 

595
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,030
yeah so we put a piston here get the
block and then that's a little strange

596
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
block and then that's a little strange
 

597
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,100
block and then that's a little strange
we got a sheep back here and he popped

598
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,110
we got a sheep back here and he popped
 

599
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,799
we got a sheep back here and he popped
up like you supposed to and then the

600
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:09,809
up like you supposed to and then the
 

601
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,710
up like you supposed to and then the
ideas we would shear um this makes him

602
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
ideas we would shear um this makes him
 

603
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,090
ideas we would shear um this makes him
go down let's see if he wanders free

604
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,100
go down let's see if he wanders free
 

605
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,470
go down let's see if he wanders free
again it looks like he's gonna stay

606
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,480
again it looks like he's gonna stay
 

607
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,639
again it looks like he's gonna stay
somehow I think the Sheep gained the

608
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:19,649
somehow I think the Sheep gained the
 

609
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,679
somehow I think the Sheep gained the
ability to walk through blocks I don't

610
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:21,689
ability to walk through blocks I don't
 

611
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:24,379
ability to walk through blocks I don't
know why but once I put him back here

612
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:24,389
know why but once I put him back here
 

613
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,509
know why but once I put him back here
they seem to be fine again look at this

614
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:26,519
they seem to be fine again look at this
 

615
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,869
they seem to be fine again look at this
guy you see this oh come on

616
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:31,879
guy you see this oh come on
 

617
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,309
guy you see this oh come on
okay where some reason the lead does not

618
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:34,319
okay where some reason the lead does not
 

619
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:38,150
okay where some reason the lead does not
work on this one yeah so I don't think

620
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
work on this one yeah so I don't think
 

621
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,389
work on this one yeah so I don't think
the farms actually broken I think maybe

622
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:41,399
the farms actually broken I think maybe
 

623
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,069
the farms actually broken I think maybe
when I updated to one of the snapshots

624
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079
when I updated to one of the snapshots
 

625
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,929
when I updated to one of the snapshots
they just glitched through the block so

626
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:44,939
they just glitched through the block so
 

627
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,429
they just glitched through the block so
now and then they were able to get free

628
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:46,439
now and then they were able to get free
 

629
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,129
now and then they were able to get free
and broke the farm but now that they're

630
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:49,139
and broke the farm but now that they're
 

631
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,569
and broke the farm but now that they're
back in place I think it'll be okay

632
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:50,579
back in place I think it'll be okay
 

633
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,150
back in place I think it'll be okay
we'll test it here just to be sure by

634
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
we'll test it here just to be sure by
 

635
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,499
we'll test it here just to be sure by
the way I am still on the twenty w17 a

636
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:57,509
the way I am still on the twenty w17 a
 

637
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,999
the way I am still on the twenty w17 a
snapshot that's why it's raining

638
00:12:58,999 --> 00:12:59,009
snapshot that's why it's raining
 

639
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,419
snapshot that's why it's raining
underground here the snapshot has a few

640
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:02,429
underground here the snapshot has a few
 

641
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,299
underground here the snapshot has a few
bugs in it I also can't bonemeal two by

642
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:05,309
bugs in it I also can't bonemeal two by
 

643
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,449
bugs in it I also can't bonemeal two by
two trees which is really annoying but

644
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:08,459
two trees which is really annoying but
 

645
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,919
two trees which is really annoying but
I'm a little scared to update I'm still

646
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:09,929
I'm a little scared to update I'm still
 

647
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,049
I'm a little scared to update I'm still
waiting for the full release I think is

648
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:12,059
waiting for the full release I think is
 

649
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:12,630
waiting for the full release I think is
when we'll do

650
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:12,640
when we'll do
 

651
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,950
when we'll do
and then I'll have to fix a bunch of

652
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:13,960
and then I'll have to fix a bunch of
 

653
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,770
and then I'll have to fix a bunch of
redstone probably because they made some

654
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:16,780
redstone probably because they made some
 

655
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,680
redstone probably because they made some
changes with that but anyways let's

656
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:19,690
changes with that but anyways let's
 

657
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,940
changes with that but anyways let's
let's see what happens here that's that

658
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:23,950
let's see what happens here that's that
 

659
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,190
let's see what happens here that's that
piston things still kind of broken we

660
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,200
piston things still kind of broken we
 

661
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,300
piston things still kind of broken we
don't really need it but

662
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,310

 

663
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:36,330

okay they went down that water clearing

664
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,340
okay they went down that water clearing
 

665
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,780
okay they went down that water clearing
thing still doesn't work properly I

666
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:38,790
thing still doesn't work properly I
 

667
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,800
thing still doesn't work properly I
don't think we can fix that because the

668
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:40,810
don't think we can fix that because the
 

669
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,380
don't think we can fix that because the
mechanics changed but they wander free

670
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,390
mechanics changed but they wander free
 

671
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,880
mechanics changed but they wander free
here they gonna stay in place looks like

672
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:44,890
here they gonna stay in place looks like
 

673
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:51,900
here they gonna stay in place looks like
they're staying in place cool yeah so I

674
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:51,910
they're staying in place cool yeah so I
 

675
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,400
they're staying in place cool yeah so I
think now we're gonna get back to doing

676
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,410
think now we're gonna get back to doing
 

677
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,140
think now we're gonna get back to doing
some new stuff here with another updates

678
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,150
some new stuff here with another updates
 

679
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,950
some new stuff here with another updates
at our bastion a renovation project

680
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:57,960
at our bastion a renovation project
 

681
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,360
at our bastion a renovation project
hopefully you guys enjoyed the picture

682
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,370
hopefully you guys enjoyed the picture
 

683
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,950
hopefully you guys enjoyed the picture
up stuff too though because we got a lot

684
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:01,960
up stuff too though because we got a lot
 

685
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,050
up stuff too though because we got a lot
of that to do still I know that stuff is

686
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,060
of that to do still I know that stuff is
 

687
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,880
of that to do still I know that stuff is
like it takes so much time to do and I

688
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:08,890
like it takes so much time to do and I
 

689
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,860
like it takes so much time to do and I
kind of think it's not as interesting as

690
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:10,870
kind of think it's not as interesting as
 

691
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,170
kind of think it's not as interesting as
like start a new project so that's kind

692
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,180
like start a new project so that's kind
 

693
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,090
like start a new project so that's kind
of why I don't you do it normally but it

694
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,100
of why I don't you do it normally but it
 

695
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,130
of why I don't you do it normally but it
would be good if we just get it done oh

696
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,140
would be good if we just get it done oh
 

697
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,240
would be good if we just get it done oh
yeah anyways let's get to this here so

698
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,250
yeah anyways let's get to this here so
 

699
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,950
yeah anyways let's get to this here so
we're gonna build a bit more to this

700
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:22,960
we're gonna build a bit more to this
 

701
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,180
we're gonna build a bit more to this
bridge this is like the entrance to the

702
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,190
bridge this is like the entrance to the
 

703
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,660
bridge this is like the entrance to the
bill Dover here and then I'm expecting

704
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,670
bill Dover here and then I'm expecting
 

705
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,040
bill Dover here and then I'm expecting
there might be some rooms to the left

706
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,050
there might be some rooms to the left
 

707
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,900
there might be some rooms to the left
and right of us eventually so we're

708
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,910
and right of us eventually so we're
 

709
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,690
and right of us eventually so we're
building sort of like a stronghold

710
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:35,700
building sort of like a stronghold
 

711
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,040
building sort of like a stronghold
castle sort of thing here but to be

712
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,050
castle sort of thing here but to be
 

713
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,450
castle sort of thing here but to be
honest with you I don't have a lot of

714
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:39,460
honest with you I don't have a lot of
 

715
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,150
honest with you I don't have a lot of
knowledge with how castles in that are

716
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
knowledge with how castles in that are
 

717
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
knowledge with how castles in that are
laid out so I don't know how we're

718
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,370
laid out so I don't know how we're
 

719
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,390
laid out so I don't know how we're
supposed to do the entrance here what

720
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:48,400
supposed to do the entrance here what
 

721
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,220
supposed to do the entrance here what
I'm planning on doing like what I'm

722
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,230
I'm planning on doing like what I'm
 

723
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm planning on doing like what I'm
doing here is we're just gonna extend

724
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,090
doing here is we're just gonna extend
 

725
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,610
doing here is we're just gonna extend
the bridge again with this little

726
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,620
the bridge again with this little
 

727
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,830
the bridge again with this little
section but this area is actually going

728
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:55,840
section but this area is actually going
 

729
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,410
section but this area is actually going
to be enclosed so we're gonna we're

730
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,420
to be enclosed so we're gonna we're
 

731
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,090
to be enclosed so we're gonna we're
creating like a transition area here

732
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,100
creating like a transition area here
 

733
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,880
creating like a transition area here
where we're outside on the bridge to

734
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:02,890
where we're outside on the bridge to
 

735
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,460
where we're outside on the bridge to
inside on something similar to a bridge

736
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,470
inside on something similar to a bridge
 

737
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,090
inside on something similar to a bridge
and then the next room over is gonna be

738
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,100
and then the next room over is gonna be
 

739
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,330
and then the next room over is gonna be
actual inside of the bastion here if

740
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:12,340
actual inside of the bastion here if
 

741
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,340
actual inside of the bastion here if
that makes sense and then I think on the

742
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,350
that makes sense and then I think on the
 

743
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,900
that makes sense and then I think on the
left and right of this will probably

744
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:15,910
left and right of this will probably
 

745
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,600
left and right of this will probably
have some statues just lining the walls

746
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,610
have some statues just lining the walls
 

747
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,500
have some statues just lining the walls
I think would look cool

748
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,510

 

749
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,330

so as far as I can tell bastions don't

750
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:25,340
so as far as I can tell bastions don't
 

751
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,550
so as far as I can tell bastions don't
actually have a proper entrance anywhere

752
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:27,560
actually have a proper entrance anywhere
 

753
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,620
actually have a proper entrance anywhere
so it's up to us to make our own and

754
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:29,630
so it's up to us to make our own and
 

755
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,330
so it's up to us to make our own and
this is where I decided to do it because

756
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,340
this is where I decided to do it because
 

757
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,130
this is where I decided to do it because
we got this this bridge that goes across

758
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,140
we got this this bridge that goes across
 

759
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,800
we got this this bridge that goes across
here and I like that but we do have a

760
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:35,810
here and I like that but we do have a
 

761
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,450
here and I like that but we do have a
bit of a decision to make here like do

762
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,460
bit of a decision to make here like do
 

763
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,840
bit of a decision to make here like do
we make a tiny entrance into there or do

764
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:40,850
we make a tiny entrance into there or do
 

765
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,160
we make a tiny entrance into there or do
we do a big one I think we're gonna go

766
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,170
we do a big one I think we're gonna go
 

767
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,110
we do a big one I think we're gonna go
for a big one because it doesn't make

768
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
for a big one because it doesn't make
 

769
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,820
for a big one because it doesn't make
sense to me to have this big door and

770
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:45,830
sense to me to have this big door and
 

771
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,030
sense to me to have this big door and
then like confine it down to a small

772
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
then like confine it down to a small
 

773
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,830
then like confine it down to a small
door and then have it open up again here

774
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:50,840
door and then have it open up again here
 

775
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,330
door and then have it open up again here
I think we'll just keep it about the

776
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,340
I think we'll just keep it about the
 

777
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,840
I think we'll just keep it about the
same size hey you so I think we're gonna

778
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:55,850
same size hey you so I think we're gonna
 

779
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,470
same size hey you so I think we're gonna
be ripping out from here to the other

780
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,480
be ripping out from here to the other
 

781
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,350
be ripping out from here to the other
side of this and then we'll build a door

782
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,360
side of this and then we'll build a door
 

783
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,260
side of this and then we'll build a door
much like that one over there so this is

784
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,270
much like that one over there so this is
 

785
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:11,760
much like that one over there so this is
gonna go up about seven blocks as well

786
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:11,770

 

787
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,500

very cool so we got ourselves a double

788
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,510
very cool so we got ourselves a double
 

789
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,970
very cool so we got ourselves a double
door now and I think that adds a bit

790
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:15,980
door now and I think that adds a bit
 

791
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,060
door now and I think that adds a bit
more depth to this entrance for sure so

792
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,070
more depth to this entrance for sure so
 

793
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,660
more depth to this entrance for sure so
we got those two lines there you can see

794
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:21,670
we got those two lines there you can see
 

795
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,950
we got those two lines there you can see
opens up pretty good here I think we're

796
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:23,960
opens up pretty good here I think we're
 

797
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,030
opens up pretty good here I think we're
gonna want to get rid of this nether

798
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
gonna want to get rid of this nether
 

799
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,050
gonna want to get rid of this nether
brick it's sort of in the way right yeah

800
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,060
brick it's sort of in the way right yeah
 

801
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,740
brick it's sort of in the way right yeah
eventually probably so I think what

802
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:32,750
eventually probably so I think what
 

803
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,450
eventually probably so I think what
we're gonna do next let's do the bridge

804
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:34,460
we're gonna do next let's do the bridge
 

805
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,780
we're gonna do next let's do the bridge
thing so I made a little step down here

806
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:37,790
thing so I made a little step down here
 

807
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
thing so I made a little step down here
just so everything's not on the same

808
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,130
just so everything's not on the same
 

809
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,810
just so everything's not on the same
level

810
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:40,820
level
 

811
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,220
level
right and then I think we're gonna go

812
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,230
right and then I think we're gonna go
 

813
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,710
right and then I think we're gonna go
netherrack all the way down here again

814
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
netherrack all the way down here again
 

815
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,660
netherrack all the way down here again
we have a decision to make the bridge is

816
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:46,670
we have a decision to make the bridge is
 

817
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,340
we have a decision to make the bridge is
actually only two blocks wide in the

818
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,350
actually only two blocks wide in the
 

819
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,410
actually only two blocks wide in the
bastion so do we keep it two blocks wide

820
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,420
bastion so do we keep it two blocks wide
 

821
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,170
bastion so do we keep it two blocks wide
or do we go to three I think we have to

822
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,180
or do we go to three I think we have to
 

823
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,550
or do we go to three I think we have to
go three it will drive me crazy

824
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
go three it will drive me crazy
 

825
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,550
go three it will drive me crazy
otherwise to go from an odd number here

826
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:57,560
otherwise to go from an odd number here
 

827
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:04,680
otherwise to go from an odd number here
to an even here comes another one I

828
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,690
to an even here comes another one I
 

829
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,480
to an even here comes another one I
can't believe like I saw in the patch

830
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,490
can't believe like I saw in the patch
 

831
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,640

834
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,750
two big ones now they hit so hard
 

835
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,400
two big ones now they hit so hard
already it's gonna make it really tough

836
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,410
already it's gonna make it really tough
 

837
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,960
already it's gonna make it really tough
I guess it was a bug that they weren't

838
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:19,970
I guess it was a bug that they weren't
 

839
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,670
I guess it was a bug that they weren't
getting it before oh dear

840
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:23,680
getting it before oh dear
 

841
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,080
getting it before oh dear
well change these stairs at the end from

well change these stairs at the end from
 

843
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,320
well change these stairs at the end from
to wipe to three wide as well and likely

844
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,330
to wipe to three wide as well and likely

figured out last episode we're gonna be

846
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:30,860
figured out last episode we're gonna be

because I think it looks pretty cool I'm

852
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:35,820
because I think it looks pretty cool I'm
 

853
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,190
because I think it looks pretty cool I'm
thinking we'll probably want some

854
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
thinking we'll probably want some
 

855
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,560
thinking we'll probably want some
Blackstone borders on this as well but

856
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:39,570
Blackstone borders on this as well but
 

857
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,419
Blackstone borders on this as well but
we'll try add some more details to it

858
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:41,429
we'll try add some more details to it
 

859
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,879
we'll try add some more details to it
similar to that big bridge we did out

860
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:43,889
similar to that big bridge we did out
 

861
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:45,379
similar to that big bridge we did out
there I want to add some basalt in with

862
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:45,389
there I want to add some basalt in with
 

863
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,580
there I want to add some basalt in with
this thing so maybe every three blocks

864
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:49,590
this thing so maybe every three blocks
 

865
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,849
this thing so maybe every three blocks
pace will go up with the basalts I

866
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:54,859
pace will go up with the basalts I
 

867
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,220
pace will go up with the basalts I
should little hard to see where that is

868
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,230
should little hard to see where that is
 

869
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,509
should little hard to see where that is
and then we'll have a slab I want to use

870
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:02,519
and then we'll have a slab I want to use
 

871
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,049
and then we'll have a slab I want to use
these nice ones though extra will leave

872
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:06,059
these nice ones though extra will leave
 

873
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,549
these nice ones though extra will leave
the nether axe showing on the outside

874
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:07,559
the nether axe showing on the outside
 

875
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,200
the nether axe showing on the outside
kind of like we did on the big bridge

876
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,210
kind of like we did on the big bridge
 

877
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,479
kind of like we did on the big bridge
there and then I'm thinking acacia

878
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:13,489
there and then I'm thinking acacia
 

879
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,570
there and then I'm thinking acacia
trapdoors as like railing keep you from

880
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:17,580
trapdoors as like railing keep you from
 

881
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,149
trapdoors as like railing keep you from
falling off sort of thing it might be

882
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:20,159
falling off sort of thing it might be
 

883
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,099
falling off sort of thing it might be
cool I feel like I want to get another

884
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:22,109
cool I feel like I want to get another
 

885
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:25,340
cool I feel like I want to get another
color in here like orange and at case

886
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,350
color in here like orange and at case
 

887
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,659
color in here like orange and at case
your trap doors is the way of doing that

888
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:26,669
your trap doors is the way of doing that
 

889
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:30,499
your trap doors is the way of doing that
and then slabs over top of these okay so

890
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:30,509
and then slabs over top of these okay so
 

891
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,629
and then slabs over top of these okay so
here's our side profile that mini bridge

892
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:32,639
here's our side profile that mini bridge
 

893
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,330
here's our side profile that mini bridge
and I think it's okay I do find that

894
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
and I think it's okay I do find that
 

895
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,399
and I think it's okay I do find that
acacia stands out a lot those who we

896
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:37,409
acacia stands out a lot those who we
 

897
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,039
acacia stands out a lot those who we
might need to change it but this is also

898
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,049
might need to change it but this is also
 

899
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,779
might need to change it but this is also
the worst angle for seeing it because

900
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:41,789
the worst angle for seeing it because
 

901
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,849
the worst angle for seeing it because
usually you'll see it like this right

902
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:43,859
usually you'll see it like this right
 

903
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,690
usually you'll see it like this right
and that's not too bad yeah we'll have

904
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:47,700
and that's not too bad yeah we'll have
 

905
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,029
and that's not too bad yeah we'll have
to think about that one I think is what

906
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,039
to think about that one I think is what
 

907
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,379
to think about that one I think is what
it looks like from up here which i think

908
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:51,389
it looks like from up here which i think
 

909
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:54,560
it looks like from up here which i think
is cool I want to add some red nether

910
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,570
is cool I want to add some red nether
 

911
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,690
is cool I want to add some red nether
brick down the middle these stairs I

912
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:56,700
brick down the middle these stairs I
 

913
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,409
brick down the middle these stairs I
think for a bit more color a bit more

914
00:18:59,409 --> 00:18:59,419
think for a bit more color a bit more
 

915
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:05,810
think for a bit more color a bit more
texture and stuff good things yeah let's

916
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:05,820
texture and stuff good things yeah let's
 

917
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,190
texture and stuff good things yeah let's
do one on this little stair thing - cool

918
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
do one on this little stair thing - cool
 

919
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,129
do one on this little stair thing - cool
so I noticed that this seems to be two

920
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:13,139
so I noticed that this seems to be two
 

921
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,009
so I noticed that this seems to be two
blocks thick here so maybe this is

922
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,019
blocks thick here so maybe this is
 

923
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,940
blocks thick here so maybe this is
double check let's go up here look yeah

924
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:19,950
double check let's go up here look yeah
 

925
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,739
double check let's go up here look yeah
you see how the the ground is kind of up

926
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:21,749
you see how the the ground is kind of up
 

927
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,619
you see how the the ground is kind of up
there so maybe what we'll do is is shave

928
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:24,629
there so maybe what we'll do is is shave
 

929
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,930
there so maybe what we'll do is is shave
off a block down here so that it's at

930
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:26,940
off a block down here so that it's at
 

931
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,060
off a block down here so that it's at
least three blocks tall person to walk

932
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,070
least three blocks tall person to walk
 

933
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,639
least three blocks tall person to walk
under and it'll feel better compared to

934
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:31,649
under and it'll feel better compared to
 

935
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,460
under and it'll feel better compared to
a two block grant space you know so

936
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:34,470
a two block grant space you know so
 

937
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,470
a two block grant space you know so
where we can where it makes sense we're

938
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
where we can where it makes sense we're
 

939
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
where we can where it makes sense we're
trying to match the original Bastion

940
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:38,730
trying to match the original Bastion
 

941
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,269
trying to match the original Bastion
design I feel like this is one of those

942
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:41,279
design I feel like this is one of those
 

943
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,159
design I feel like this is one of those
cases that doesn't make a lot of sense

944
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:43,169
cases that doesn't make a lot of sense
 

945
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,930
cases that doesn't make a lot of sense
to me like there's a staircase here

946
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:45,940
to me like there's a staircase here
 

947
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,730
to me like there's a staircase here
that goes up and then whoo it just kind

948
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:50,740
that goes up and then whoo it just kind
 

949
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,669
that goes up and then whoo it just kind
of falls off it's a little strange right

950
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
of falls off it's a little strange right
 

951
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,659
of falls off it's a little strange right
I almost think I want to cover over this

952
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:56,669
I almost think I want to cover over this
 

953
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,450
I almost think I want to cover over this
to block gap here I know it's not it's

954
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:00,460
to block gap here I know it's not it's
 

955
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,340
to block gap here I know it's not it's
not like then the original design I

956
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,350
not like then the original design I
 

957
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,409
not like then the original design I
think will just make the floor a little

958
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:04,419
think will just make the floor a little
 

959
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,259
think will just make the floor a little
fatter here and then have a staircase to

960
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:07,269
fatter here and then have a staircase to
 

961
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:12,509
fatter here and then have a staircase to
go down over here and I think that'll be

962
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:12,519
go down over here and I think that'll be
 

963
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,230
go down over here and I think that'll be
pretty cool

964
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,240
pretty cool
 

965
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,509
pretty cool
let's also replace probably two blocks

966
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:15,519
let's also replace probably two blocks
 

967
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,249
let's also replace probably two blocks
of this black stone with the netherrack

968
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:19,259
of this black stone with the netherrack
 

969
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,220
of this black stone with the netherrack
let's check out our magma cube firm we

970
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,230
let's check out our magma cube firm we
 

971
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,960
let's check out our magma cube firm we
built last episode I'm curious how many

972
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:24,970
built last episode I'm curious how many
 

973
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,999
built last episode I'm curious how many
drops that's alright 30 and a stack okay

974
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,009
drops that's alright 30 and a stack okay
 

975
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,460
drops that's alright 30 and a stack okay
not a lot I haven't been here for too

976
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,470
not a lot I haven't been here for too
 

977
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,090
not a lot I haven't been here for too
long yet this is starting to feel good

978
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,100
long yet this is starting to feel good
 

979
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,529
long yet this is starting to feel good
to me though it's starting to feel like

980
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:37,539
to me though it's starting to feel like
 

981
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:41,249
to me though it's starting to feel like
a like I something so we got the Gabbin

982
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:41,259
a like I something so we got the Gabbin
 

983
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,169
a like I something so we got the Gabbin
Allium all over here we're just

984
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:43,179
Allium all over here we're just
 

985
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,149
Allium all over here we're just
basically laying the groundwork for the

986
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:45,159
basically laying the groundwork for the
 

987
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,980
basically laying the groundwork for the
our structure here and then hopefully we

988
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:46,990
our structure here and then hopefully we
 

989
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,899
our structure here and then hopefully we
can figure out some details to add like

990
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:48,909
can figure out some details to add like
 

991
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,539
can figure out some details to add like
in the walls and stuff and that'll make

992
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:51,549
in the walls and stuff and that'll make
 

993
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,070
in the walls and stuff and that'll make
the build start looking really good

994
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,080
the build start looking really good
 

995
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,659
the build start looking really good
hopefully um let's oh yeah I wanted to

996
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:57,669
hopefully um let's oh yeah I wanted to
 

997
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,740
hopefully um let's oh yeah I wanted to
do something here so we popped out bees

998
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:01,750
do something here so we popped out bees
 

999
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,930
do something here so we popped out bees
when we put the door in let's put them

1000
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:03,940
when we put the door in let's put them
 

1001
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,200
when we put the door in let's put them
back now do you like that would come all

1002
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,210
back now do you like that would come all
 

1003
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,399
back now do you like that would come all
the way down and then it's probably

1004
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:08,409
the way down and then it's probably
 

1005
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:14,850
the way down and then it's probably
another one on this side it actually

1006
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:14,860
another one on this side it actually
 

1007
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,419
another one on this side it actually
doesn't line up because this is a side

1008
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:18,429
doesn't line up because this is a side
 

1009
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:20,700
doesn't line up because this is a side
that we changed from an even number to

1010
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:20,710
that we changed from an even number to
 

1011
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,590
that we changed from an even number to
an odd so we're gonna have to move

1012
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:22,600
an odd so we're gonna have to move
 

1013
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,220
an odd so we're gonna have to move
everything like one block over probably

1014
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,230
everything like one block over probably
 

1015
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,769
everything like one block over probably
yeah we'll do something like that um I

1016
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:28,779
yeah we'll do something like that um I
 

1017
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,470
yeah we'll do something like that um I
think I want to add like a balcony here

1018
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,480
think I want to add like a balcony here
 

1019
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,789
think I want to add like a balcony here
maybe this becomes stairs you're gonna

1020
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:35,799
maybe this becomes stairs you're gonna
 

1021
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,799
maybe this becomes stairs you're gonna
shoot me down no no

1022
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:39,809
shoot me down no no
 

1023
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,649
shoot me down no no
yeah and then let's do trapdoors here

1024
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:44,659
yeah and then let's do trapdoors here
 

1025
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,539
yeah and then let's do trapdoors here
good stuff so we got our pillars in here

1026
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:47,549
good stuff so we got our pillars in here
 

1027
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:49,369
good stuff so we got our pillars in here
we might change that out with the basalt

1028
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:49,379
we might change that out with the basalt
 

1029
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:52,219
we might change that out with the basalt
later or these walls or a combination of

1030
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:52,229
later or these walls or a combination of
 

1031
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,830
later or these walls or a combination of
the two and now we have our balconies

1032
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,840
the two and now we have our balconies
 

1033
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,269
the two and now we have our balconies
with the railing up there I think is

1034
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:56,279
with the railing up there I think is
 

1035
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,539
with the railing up there I think is
cool now we have to kind of make some

1036
00:21:59,539 --> 00:21:59,549
cool now we have to kind of make some
 

1037
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:02,509
cool now we have to kind of make some
imagination guesses here like what these

1038
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:02,519
imagination guesses here like what these
 

1039
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,879
imagination guesses here like what these
things are this feels like a little

1040
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:04,889
things are this feels like a little
 

1041
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,940
things are this feels like a little
lookout area to me like we got a bunch

1042
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:07,950
lookout area to me like we got a bunch
 

1043
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,580
lookout area to me like we got a bunch
of these openings all along the path so

1044
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:10,590
of these openings all along the path so
 

1045
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,879
of these openings all along the path so
maybe we try do something with with

1046
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:13,889
maybe we try do something with with
 

1047
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,310
maybe we try do something with with
these we'll make them pop out an extra

1048
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
these we'll make them pop out an extra
 

1049
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,070
these we'll make them pop out an extra
block just so they have a bit more depth

1050
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
block just so they have a bit more depth
 

1051
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,269
block just so they have a bit more depth
than will look better I'm gonna put a

1052
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:23,279
than will look better I'm gonna put a
 

1053
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,180
than will look better I'm gonna put a
polished slab here and then assault on

1054
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,190
polished slab here and then assault on
 

1055
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,709
polished slab here and then assault on
top and then maybe another polished one

1056
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:29,719
top and then maybe another polished one
 

1057
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,659
top and then maybe another polished one
over that and then this is gonna be more

1058
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:32,669
over that and then this is gonna be more
 

1059
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,869
over that and then this is gonna be more
railing but you don't fall down you

1060
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:35,879
railing but you don't fall down you
 

1061
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:36,769
railing but you don't fall down you
don't want to fall down that would be

1062
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:36,779
don't want to fall down that would be
 

1063
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,979
don't want to fall down that would be
bad and then probably entirely I'm up to

1064
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:39,989
bad and then probably entirely I'm up to
 

1065
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:47,499
bad and then probably entirely I'm up to
here and how does that look it's okay

1066
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:47,509
here and how does that look it's okay
 

1067
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,879
here and how does that look it's okay
alright we're gonna make these stairs

1068
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:49,889
alright we're gonna make these stairs
 

1069
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,219
alright we're gonna make these stairs
actually on top awesome so we're

1070
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:52,229
actually on top awesome so we're
 

1071
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,719
actually on top awesome so we're
starting to figure some things out over

1072
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:53,729
starting to figure some things out over
 

1073
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:56,509
starting to figure some things out over
here which is great we're at the point

1074
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:56,519
here which is great we're at the point
 

1075
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,979
here which is great we're at the point
though are we gonna start wrapping up

1076
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:57,989
though are we gonna start wrapping up
 

1077
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,979
though are we gonna start wrapping up
for today because I put a lot of camera

1078
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:00,989
for today because I put a lot of camera
 

1079
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:03,739
for today because I put a lot of camera
work into this one it's been taken I

1080
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:03,749
work into this one it's been taken I
 

1081
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,139
work into this one it's been taken I
took a bit of time to do this episode uh

1082
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:06,149
took a bit of time to do this episode uh
 

1083
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,869
took a bit of time to do this episode uh
but yeah let's let's just check this out

1084
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:08,879
but yeah let's let's just check this out
 

1085
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,969
but yeah let's let's just check this out
so I added a door frame over here I

1086
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:10,979
so I added a door frame over here I
 

1087
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,919
so I added a door frame over here I
think what we'll do because we don't

1088
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:12,929
think what we'll do because we don't
 

1089
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,389
think what we'll do because we don't
want to change too much of this main

1090
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:14,399
want to change too much of this main
 

1091
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,759
want to change too much of this main
room like we're not gonna be putting any

1092
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:16,769
room like we're not gonna be putting any
 

1093
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,979
room like we're not gonna be putting any
firms or anything in here or any cool

1094
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:18,989
firms or anything in here or any cool
 

1095
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,950
firms or anything in here or any cool
builds those are gonna go branching off

1096
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:21,960
builds those are gonna go branching off
 

1097
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,779
builds those are gonna go branching off
of this room so we'll probably build

1098
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:23,789
of this room so we'll probably build
 

1099
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:26,899
of this room so we'll probably build
like out this way there's actually a lot

1100
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:26,909
like out this way there's actually a lot
 

1101
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,619
like out this way there's actually a lot
of space back here yeah so we'll make

1102
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:30,629
of space back here yeah so we'll make
 

1103
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,930
of space back here yeah so we'll make
connections to this main room and then

1104
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:32,940
connections to this main room and then
 

1105
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,299
connections to this main room and then

whatever I want to do right what I've
 

1163
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,680
whatever I want to do right what I've
done lately is I've watched some of my

1164
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:42,690
done lately is I've watched some of my
 

1165
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,080
done lately is I've watched some of my
videos critically and I've tried to look

1166
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,090
videos critically and I've tried to look
 

1167
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,600
videos critically and I've tried to look
for ways of improving one of the main

1168
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:47,610
for ways of improving one of the main
 

1169
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,509
for ways of improving one of the main
things I noticed is in my videos I tend

1170
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:50,519
things I noticed is in my videos I tend
 

1171
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,120
things I noticed is in my videos I tend
to repeat things a lot so I'll say

1172
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,130
to repeat things a lot so I'll say
 

1173
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,289
to repeat things a lot so I'll say
something and I'll say it again in a

1174
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:54,299
something and I'll say it again in a
 

1175
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,600
something and I'll say it again in a
different way and that's good in the

1176
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:56,610
different way and that's good in the
 

1177
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,879
different way and that's good in the
sense that it can clarify something but

1178
00:24:58,879 --> 00:24:58,889
sense that it can clarify something but
 

1179
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,909
sense that it can clarify something but
it also just drags out the video and

1180
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:00,919
it also just drags out the video and
 

1181
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,409
it also just drags out the video and
doesn't add any new information so I'm

1182
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:03,419
doesn't add any new information so I'm
 

1183
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,870
doesn't add any new information so I'm
trying to avoid doing that also I tend

1184
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:05,880
trying to avoid doing that also I tend
 

1185
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,669
trying to avoid doing that also I tend
to use a lot of generalized words and

1186
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
to use a lot of generalized words and
 

1187
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,070
to use a lot of generalized words and
I'm hoping to use more specific words in

1188
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm hoping to use more specific words in
 

1189
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,840
I'm hoping to use more specific words in
the future like I'll say that thing and

1190
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:14,850
the future like I'll say that thing and
 

1191
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,370
the future like I'll say that thing and
I won't say what that thing actually is

1192
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,380
I won't say what that thing actually is
 

1193
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,190
I won't say what that thing actually is
you know but bad habit so I'm trying to

1194
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
you know but bad habit so I'm trying to
 

1195
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,379
you know but bad habit so I'm trying to
be more specific in the videos now that

1196
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:21,389
be more specific in the videos now that
 

1197
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,690
be more specific in the videos now that
convey more information and also I'm

1198
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:23,700
convey more information and also I'm
 

1199
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,680
convey more information and also I'm
just cutting a lot more of the stuff we

1200
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:27,690
just cutting a lot more of the stuff we
 

1201
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,690
just cutting a lot more of the stuff we
don't need in the episodes so it seems

1202
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:29,700
don't need in the episodes so it seems
 

1203
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,820
don't need in the episodes so it seems
to be faster paced even though it's

1204
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:31,830
to be faster paced even though it's
 

1205
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,310
to be faster paced even though it's
pretty much the same way of recording

1206
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
pretty much the same way of recording
 

1207
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,460
pretty much the same way of recording
