41
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,280

farmland even though they can walk on it
 

49
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,920
farmland even though they can walk on it

241
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,020

that's true because I've seen slimes

242
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,030
that's true because I've seen slimes
 

243
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,350

system here just to give the corridors a

256
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
system here just to give the corridors a
 

257
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,830
system here just to give the corridors a
nice feel and then I'll do branch

258
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
nice feel and then I'll do branch
 

259
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,530
nice feel and then I'll do branch
fighting and I'll probably be using

260
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:14,540
fighting and I'll probably be using
 

261
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,750
fighting and I'll probably be using
these for rail tracks these 3x3

262
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:16,760
these for rail tracks these 3x3
 

263
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,680
these for rail tracks these 3x3
corridors alright guys I think we're

264
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:20,690
corridors alright guys I think we're
 

265
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,990
corridors alright guys I think we're
ready to start building the faceplate

266
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,000
ready to start building the faceplate
 

267
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,910
ready to start building the faceplate
here so let's tear down this wall we're

268
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:27,920
here so let's tear down this wall we're
 

269
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,080
here so let's tear down this wall we're
going to try copy this one exactly or

270
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,090
going to try copy this one exactly or
 

271
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,500
going to try copy this one exactly or
close to exactly this is going to be a

272
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,510
close to exactly this is going to be a
 

273
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,660
close to exactly this is going to be a
problem though because I want to put

274
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,670
problem though because I want to put
 

275
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,410
problem though because I want to put
glowstone here and that will let light

276
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:41,420
glowstone here and that will let light
 

277
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,180
glowstone here and that will let light
into the cave spider thing so I'll have

278
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,190
into the cave spider thing so I'll have
 

279
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,930
into the cave spider thing so I'll have
to place some blocks here which will

280
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:49,940
to place some blocks here which will
 

281
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,420
to place some blocks here which will
slightly decrease the spawning rates of

282
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,430
slightly decrease the spawning rates of
 

283
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,600
slightly decrease the spawning rates of
the spiders but very minimal effect we

284
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,610
the spiders but very minimal effect we
 

285
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,260
the spiders but very minimal effect we
need to do that to block the light and

286
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,270
need to do that to block the light and
 

287
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,150
need to do that to block the light and
then going to put another brick in the

288
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
then going to put another brick in the
 

289
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
then going to put another brick in the
back

290
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,090

 

291
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,480

that so it's very similar to that one um

292
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,490
that so it's very similar to that one um
 

293
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,620
that so it's very similar to that one um
put our iron bar

294
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,630
put our iron bar
 

295
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:21,680
put our iron bar
I brought a button with me so we'll set

296
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,690
I brought a button with me so we'll set
 

297
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,880
I brought a button with me so we'll set
up that piston pusher thing I think it

298
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:25,890
up that piston pusher thing I think it
 

299
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:31,880
up that piston pusher thing I think it
went back there think so

300
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:31,890
went back there think so
 

301
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:38,110
went back there think so
and then there was redstone above there

302
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,120

 

303
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,230

oops

304
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,240
oops
 

305
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,340
oops
get aerial cover that up let's check it

306
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,350
get aerial cover that up let's check it
 

307
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,020
get aerial cover that up let's check it
works okay so then we'll have let's see

308
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,030
works okay so then we'll have let's see
 

309
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,660
works okay so then we'll have let's see
this leaver turns the spiders on or off

310
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:56,670
this leaver turns the spiders on or off
 

311
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,170
this leaver turns the spiders on or off
so we'll we'll have one here as well

312
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,180
so we'll we'll have one here as well
 

313
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,010
so we'll we'll have one here as well
turn slimes on or off the slime fern on

314
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,020
turn slimes on or off the slime fern on
 

315
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,560
turn slimes on or off the slime fern on
or off we'll probably have to flood the

316
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,570
or off we'll probably have to flood the
 

317
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,800
or off we'll probably have to flood the
pads to do that hopefully we can figure

318
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,810
pads to do that hopefully we can figure
 

319
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,460
pads to do that hopefully we can figure
something out

320
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,470

 

321
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,110

we're going to be dropping little slimes

322
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
we're going to be dropping little slimes
 

323
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,960
we're going to be dropping little slimes
onto the iron bar here we'll probably

324
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:17,970
onto the iron bar here we'll probably
 

325
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,440
onto the iron bar here we'll probably
have another lever to control whether we

326
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,450
have another lever to control whether we
 

327
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,940
have another lever to control whether we
kill them with the drop or if they just

328
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:22,950
kill them with the drop or if they just
 

329
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,190
kill them with the drop or if they just
collect here so that we can kill them

330
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
collect here so that we can kill them
 

331
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,460
collect here so that we can kill them
ourselves for a little bit of XP the

332
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:28,470
ourselves for a little bit of XP the
 

333
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,550
ourselves for a little bit of XP the
mini slimes they only drop one XP while

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
mini slimes they only drop one XP while

five so it's not a huge way of getting

338
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:36,960
five so it's not a huge way of getting
 

339
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,730
five so it's not a huge way of getting
XP but there'll be lots of them

340
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:39,740
XP but there'll be lots of them
 

341
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,180

there so and we'll just drop them down

344
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,220
there so and we'll just drop them down
 

345
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,800
there so and we'll just drop them down
here okay so now that we should work on

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
the spawning pads and then hook it up to

here spawning pads are going to take a
 

351
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,890
here spawning pads are going to take a
long time be a lot of digging but we'll

352
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:06,900
long time be a lot of digging but we'll
 

353
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,090

see how it goes yes I use this slime

some reason I've been watching them for

404
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:37,620
some reason I've been watching them for
 

405
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,699
some reason I've been watching them for
a few minutes here and he's constantly

406
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:40,709
a few minutes here and he's constantly
 

407
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,900
a few minutes here and he's constantly
trying to hop to that corner I'm over 16

blocks away from him now so he doesn't

410
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:46,740
blocks away from him now so he doesn't
 

411
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,939
blocks away from him now so he doesn't
see me I'm curious I let him track me

412
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:51,949
see me I'm curious I let him track me
 

413
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:55,280
see me I'm curious I let him track me
and then get 16 blocks away if he's

414
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,290
and then get 16 blocks away if he's
 

415
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,960
and then get 16 blocks away if he's
going to return to that same corner and

416
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:58,970
going to return to that same corner and
 

417
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,439
going to return to that same corner and
why is he going to that corner no he's

418
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:03,449
why is he going to that corner no he's
 

419
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,920
why is he going to that corner no he's
still tracking me darn

420
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:05,930
still tracking me darn
 

421
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,379
still tracking me darn
the other thing originally I was

422
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:09,389
the other thing originally I was
 

423
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,840
the other thing originally I was
thinking I would just have small slimes

424
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,850
thinking I would just have small slimes
 

425
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,750
thinking I would just have small slimes
here split them down at the spawning

426
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
here split them down at the spawning
 

427
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,210
here split them down at the spawning
area and then have them come up a ladder

428
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,220
area and then have them come up a ladder
 

429
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,829
area and then have them come up a ladder
or something and drop them down here

430
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
or something and drop them down here
 

431
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,110
or something and drop them down here
it's thinking of having multiple levels

432
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,120
it's thinking of having multiple levels
 

433
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,759
it's thinking of having multiple levels
of the slime farm now I'm kind of

434
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:28,769
of the slime farm now I'm kind of
 

435
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,470
of the slime farm now I'm kind of
thinking I'll try to get the big slimes

436
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
thinking I'll try to get the big slimes
 

437
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,090
thinking I'll try to get the big slimes
here too and just have one level

438
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,100
here too and just have one level
 

439
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
here too and just have one level
possibly like I said I have to figure

440
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,110
possibly like I said I have to figure
 

441
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,850
possibly like I said I have to figure
out what I'm doing here so is he

442
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:43,860
out what I'm doing here so is he
 

443
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,519
out what I'm doing here so is he
tracking me or what's he doing I should

444
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:46,529
tracking me or what's he doing I should
 

445
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,780
tracking me or what's he doing I should
dig through let's see let's count the

446
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:50,790
dig through let's see let's count the
 

447
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,559
dig through let's see let's count the
blocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

448
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:57,569

451
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,370

should be out of range what's he gonna

452
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:04,380
should be out of range what's he gonna
 

453
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:14,060
should be out of range what's he gonna
do so now he's favoring that corner so I

454
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,070
do so now he's favoring that corner so I
 

455
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,540
do so now he's favoring that corner so I
don't know why they do that

456
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,550

 

457
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,980

tinnie attack me in here I don't think

458
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:21,990
tinnie attack me in here I don't think
 

459
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,670
tinnie attack me in here I don't think
you can it's only if they can get up to

460
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
you can it's only if they can get up to
 

461
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,210
you can it's only if they can get up to
your head

462
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,220

 

463
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,750

another theory people have is that maybe

464
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:34,760

 

465
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,000

like these guys can spawn anywhere from

466
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,010
like these guys can spawn anywhere from
 

467
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,760
like these guys can spawn anywhere from
level 14 below but maybe at the higher

468
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:40,770
level 14 below but maybe at the higher
 

469
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,490
level 14 below but maybe at the higher
levels their spawning rate is decreased

470
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:43,500
levels their spawning rate is decreased
 

471
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,540
levels their spawning rate is decreased
like this ground could actually probably

472
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,550
like this ground could actually probably
 

473
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,040
like this ground could actually probably
go up to more blocks so my head's at

474
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,050
go up to more blocks so my head's at
 

475
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,190
go up to more blocks so my head's at
forty point six instead but maybe it

476
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,200
forty point six instead but maybe it
 

477
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,130
forty point six instead but maybe it
forty point six the spawning rates a lot

478
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,140
forty point six the spawning rates a lot
 

479
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,380
forty point six the spawning rates a lot
lower than if you're at like level ten

480
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,390
lower than if you're at like level ten
 

481
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,320
lower than if you're at like level ten
or something I did catch this guy - I

482
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,330
or something I did catch this guy - I
 

483
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,500
or something I did catch this guy - I
don't know where he came from so I don't

484
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,510
don't know where he came from so I don't
 

485
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,570
don't know where he came from so I don't
know I'll figure something is out had an

486
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:17,580
know I'll figure something is out had an
 

487
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,660
know I'll figure something is out had an
idea for like a rough comparison we

488
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:20,670
idea for like a rough comparison we
 

489
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,200
idea for like a rough comparison we
could make for the spawning rates of the

490
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,210
could make for the spawning rates of the
 

491
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,140
could make for the spawning rates of the
different levels for slime farms so

492
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,150
different levels for slime farms so
 

493
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,020
different levels for slime farms so
before I was waiting for slimes to spawn

494
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,030
before I was waiting for slimes to spawn
 

495
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,850
before I was waiting for slimes to spawn
in that other farm I made sure this one

496
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:31,860
in that other farm I made sure this one
 

497
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,760
in that other farm I made sure this one
is clear - so there was no slimes in

498
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:34,770
is clear - so there was no slimes in
 

499
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,890
is clear - so there was no slimes in
here we got one or two up at that other

500
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:39,900
here we got one or two up at that other
 

501
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,260
here we got one or two up at that other
one there they're both about the same

502
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,270
one there they're both about the same
 

503
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,829
one there they're both about the same
size at this one is two levels and

504
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
size at this one is two levels and
 

505
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,660
size at this one is two levels and
there's three there are three slimes

506
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,670
there's three there are three slimes
 

507
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:56,630
there's three there are three slimes
here so I don't really see any

508
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:56,640
here so I don't really see any
 

509
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,910
here so I don't really see any
difference in this bonding rates for the

510
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
difference in this bonding rates for the
 

511
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,590
difference in this bonding rates for the
different levels so I think it's about

512
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:00,600
different levels so I think it's about
 

513
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,910
different levels so I think it's about
equal no matter what the level is just

514
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:04,920
equal no matter what the level is just
 

515
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,100
equal no matter what the level is just
from this rough comparison this isn't a

516
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,110
from this rough comparison this isn't a
 

517
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,990
from this rough comparison this isn't a
very scientific way of figuring it out

518
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
very scientific way of figuring it out
 

519
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,829
very scientific way of figuring it out
but

520
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839

 

521
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,889

it's good enough for me because this is

522
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:15,899
it's good enough for me because this is
 

523
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,400
it's good enough for me because this is
two levels there were three sign here

524
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,410
two levels there were three sign here
 

525
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,250
two levels there were three sign here
the other on the head was one level with

526
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,260
the other on the head was one level with
 

527
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,120
the other on the head was one level with
one slime

528
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,130
one slime
 

529
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,040
one slime
so yeah it's about the same that of

530
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,050
so yeah it's about the same that of
 

531
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,269
so yeah it's about the same that of
course there's going to be small

532
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
course there's going to be small
 

533
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,840
course there's going to be small
differences but if there was like 20

534
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:32,850
differences but if there was like 20
 

535
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,300
differences but if there was like 20
slides in here obviously the height

536
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,310
slides in here obviously the height
 

537
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,009
slides in here obviously the height
level would matter and this is a why 13

538
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:40,019
level would matter and this is a why 13
 

539
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:48,590
level would matter and this is a why 13
and this is why 9 okay so I think I

540
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,600
and this is why 9 okay so I think I
 

541
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,690
and this is why 9 okay so I think I
figure out what I want to do here I'm

542
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:50,700
figure out what I want to do here I'm
 

543
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,840
figure out what I want to do here I'm
going to remove three blocks up in this

544
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:53,850
going to remove three blocks up in this
 

545
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,449
going to remove three blocks up in this
square I have then I'll probably fill in

546
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:58,459
square I have then I'll probably fill in
 

547
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,819
square I have then I'll probably fill in
two blocks so this area everything you

548
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:01,829
two blocks so this area everything you
 

549
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,440
two blocks so this area everything you
see here I'll probably have to fill in

550
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,450
see here I'll probably have to fill in
 

551
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,100
see here I'll probably have to fill in
again which sucks but that's probably

552
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,110
again which sucks but that's probably
 

553
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,750
again which sucks but that's probably
the best thing to do and then I'm going

554
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:08,760
the best thing to do and then I'm going
 

555
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,930
the best thing to do and then I'm going
to put three wide water canals all the

556
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:11,940
to put three wide water canals all the
 

557
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,639
to put three wide water canals all the
way around the 16 by 16 chunk they will

558
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:16,649
way around the 16 by 16 chunk they will
 

559
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,690
way around the 16 by 16 chunk they will
funnel the slimes to this corner here

560
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:20,700
funnel the slimes to this corner here
 

561
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,300
funnel the slimes to this corner here
and then I'll have a staircase water

562
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,310
and then I'll have a staircase water
 

563
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:32,780
and then I'll have a staircase water
system to bring the slimes up to this

564
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:32,790
system to bring the slimes up to this
 

565
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,000
system to bring the slimes up to this
area here something that will carry the

566
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,010
area here something that will carry the
 

567
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,819
area here something that will carry the
the big slimes and medium slimes and the

568
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:37,829
the big slimes and medium slimes and the
 

569
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,650
the big slimes and medium slimes and the
little slimes up to this point here

570
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660
little slimes up to this point here
 

571
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,579
little slimes up to this point here
and I'll probably modify this faceplate

572
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:45,589

 

573
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,060

somehow quite a bit I don't know exactly

574
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,070
somehow quite a bit I don't know exactly
 

575
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,900
somehow quite a bit I don't know exactly
what I'm doing and then we will take it

576
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:53,910
what I'm doing and then we will take it
 

577
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,949
what I'm doing and then we will take it
from there and see how it works that the

578
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959
from there and see how it works that the
 

579
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,889
from there and see how it works that the
thing is there's this annoying thing

580
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:00,899
thing is there's this annoying thing
 

581
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,520
thing is there's this annoying thing
about mob systems now if the mobs

582
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,530
about mob systems now if the mobs
 

583
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,230
about mob systems now if the mobs
passive mobs and hostile mobs will only

584
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
passive mobs and hostile mobs will only
 

585
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,750
passive mobs and hostile mobs will only
move around if you're within 40 blocks

586
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
move around if you're within 40 blocks
 

587
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,590
move around if you're within 40 blocks
of them so if I dig a slime farm near

588
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:12,600
of them so if I dig a slime farm near
 

589
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,549
of them so if I dig a slime farm near
bedrock it's not going to work it's not

590
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
bedrock it's not going to work it's not
 

591
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,890
bedrock it's not going to work it's not
they're not going to be able to get

592
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:18,900
they're not going to be able to get
 

593
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,850
they're not going to be able to get
transported up to here because it'll

594
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,860
transported up to here because it'll
 

595
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,710
transported up to here because it'll
probably be too far away

596
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
probably be too far away
 

597
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,860
probably be too far away
because if we go 40 blocks down then

598
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:27,870
because if we go 40 blocks down then
 

599
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,600
because if we go 40 blocks down then
they're out of range they won't move and

600
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,610
they're out of range they won't move and
 

601
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,669
they're out of range they won't move and
there's no way they'll find their way up

602
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
there's no way they'll find their way up
 

603
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,379
there's no way they'll find their way up
here the other thing is sorry I keep

604
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:36,389
here the other thing is sorry I keep
 

605
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,139
here the other thing is sorry I keep
wandering around here other thing is if

606
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:39,149
wandering around here other thing is if
 

607
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:44,269
wandering around here other thing is if
we're standing here oops this is going

608
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:44,279
we're standing here oops this is going
 

609
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,019
we're standing here oops this is going
to be a problem

610
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:45,029
to be a problem
 

611
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,629
to be a problem
the mobs the slimes will have to be 24

actually work that's about 22 blocks we

622

actually work that's about 22 blocks we
 

623
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,619
actually work that's about 22 blocks we
need them to be 24 blocks or further to

need them to be 24 blocks or further to

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:25,830
problem there might be a little bit of
 

629
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,440
problem there might be a little bit of
area where they won't spawn because of

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,450
area where they won't spawn because of
 

631
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,320
area where they won't spawn because of
that but that's only if we're right up

632
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,330
that but that's only if we're right up
 

633
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,990
that but that's only if we're right up
front there for like a tower potion room

634
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,000
front there for like a tower potion room
 

635
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,850
front there for like a tower potion room
or something it's not a problem okay

636
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:37,860
or something it's not a problem okay
 

637
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,350
or something it's not a problem okay
so I'll play around with it some more

638
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
so I'll play around with it some more
 

639
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,210
so I'll play around with it some more
and I'll see you shortly

640
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,220
and I'll see you shortly
 

641
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,919
and I'll see you shortly
I got it done went really quick this

642
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:45,929
I got it done went really quick this
 

643
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:50,149
I got it done went really quick this
pick is great made the job go really

644
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:50,159
pick is great made the job go really
 

645
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,299
pick is great made the job go really
fast and it's got a lot of life left to

646
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:53,309
fast and it's got a lot of life left to
 

647
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,490
fast and it's got a lot of life left to
it so really happy about that

648
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:57,500

 

649
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,740

this spawning pad for the slimes is

650
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:00,750
this spawning pad for the slimes is
 

651
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,909
this spawning pad for the slimes is
sixteen by sixteen in size we've got a

652
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:04,919
sixteen by sixteen in size we've got a
 

653
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,149
sixteen by sixteen in size we've got a
three high clearance here our

654
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:08,159
three high clearance here our
 

655
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,230
three high clearance here our
y-coordinate is at forty point six so

656
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
y-coordinate is at forty point six so
 

657
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
y-coordinate is at forty point six so
before I advance this project any

658
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,250
before I advance this project any
 

659
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,860
before I advance this project any
further I just want to make sure they

660
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:15,870
further I just want to make sure they
 

661
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,119
further I just want to make sure they
can spawn at that height level so before

662
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:20,129
can spawn at that height level so before
 

663
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,340
can spawn at that height level so before
I do the water canals I want to make

664
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,350
I do the water canals I want to make
 

665
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,180
I do the water canals I want to make
sure that we'll probably end this

666
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,190
sure that we'll probably end this
 

667
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,539
sure that we'll probably end this
project here for today just so I can

668
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:29,549
project here for today just so I can
 

669
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,810
project here for today just so I can
monitor it then we will have the three

670
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:32,820
monitor it then we will have the three
 

671
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,080
monitor it then we will have the three
wide canals here they'll be able to move

672
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,090
wide canals here they'll be able to move
 

673
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,640
wide canals here they'll be able to move
the big slimes around

674
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:37,650
the big slimes around
 

675
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,840
the big slimes around
there's a two-block drop right now and

676
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:41,850
there's a two-block drop right now and
 

677
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,450
there's a two-block drop right now and
they'll bring the slimes to this corner

678
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:44,460
they'll bring the slimes to this corner
 

679
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,170
they'll bring the slimes to this corner
here when it's all done I am going to

680
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,180
here when it's all done I am going to
 

681
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,660
here when it's all done I am going to
block this area off so if any slime

682
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:50,670
block this area off so if any slime
 

683
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,299
block this area off so if any slime
spawn in here they'll stay in here I'll

684
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:53,309
spawn in here they'll stay in here I'll
 

685
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,490
spawn in here they'll stay in here I'll
be able to check they won't be able to

686
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:55,500
be able to check they won't be able to
 

687
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,490
be able to check they won't be able to
wander away or anything and when I said

688
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:58,500
wander away or anything and when I said
 

689
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,549
wander away or anything and when I said
40 blocks but before that number I guess

690
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:01,559
40 blocks but before that number I guess
 

691
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,860
40 blocks but before that number I guess
that's not really the actual number it's

692
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:03,870
that's not really the actual number it's
 

693
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,040
that's not really the actual number it's
just approximate so don't take that as

694
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,050
just approximate so don't take that as
 

695
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:13,430
just approximate so don't take that as
the actual number for how far mobs can

696
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
the actual number for how far mobs can
 

697
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,169
the actual number for how far mobs can
be before they stop moving I don't know

698
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:15,179
be before they stop moving I don't know
 

699
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,130
be before they stop moving I don't know
what the actual number is um what else

700
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,140
what the actual number is um what else
 

701
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,380
what the actual number is um what else
what else I hope I aligned this properly

702
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:23,390
what else I hope I aligned this properly
 

703
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,760
what else I hope I aligned this properly
this is really hard to explain it's

704
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:25,770
this is really hard to explain it's
 

705
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,630
this is really hard to explain it's
confusing but so our X is at 288 and

706
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
confusing but so our X is at 288 and
 

707
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,660
confusing but so our X is at 288 and
ours that is it 192 both those numbers

708
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:35,670
ours that is it 192 both those numbers
 

709
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,360
ours that is it 192 both those numbers
you can divide by 16 that's how big a

710
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,370
you can divide by 16 that's how big a
 

711
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,450
you can divide by 16 that's how big a
chunk is 16 by 16 and you'll get a whole

712
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:41,460
chunk is 16 by 16 and you'll get a whole
 

713
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,810
chunk is 16 by 16 and you'll get a whole
number now the other thing is if you go

714
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:44,820
number now the other thing is if you go
 

715
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,750
number now the other thing is if you go
to this corner like down here 304 and

716
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:50,760
to this corner like down here 304 and
 

717
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,600
to this corner like down here 304 and
208 you can also divide those by 16 and

718
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:53,610
208 you can also divide those by 16 and
 

719
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,160
208 you can also divide those by 16 and
you'll get a whole number so how do you

720
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,170
you'll get a whole number so how do you
 

721
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,750
you'll get a whole number so how do you
know where it should be one block

722
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
know where it should be one block
 

723
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,919
know where it should be one block
shorter I think the way you're supposed

724
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:03,929
shorter I think the way you're supposed
 

725
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,650
shorter I think the way you're supposed
to do it is the way I have it here where

726
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:06,660
to do it is the way I have it here where
 

727
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,110
to do it is the way I have it here where
the lower number is where you start so

728
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
the lower number is where you start so
 

729
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,460
the lower number is where you start so
192 gets bigger as you go that way and

730
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,470
192 gets bigger as you go that way and
 

731
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,980
192 gets bigger as you go that way and
288 the absolute number gets bigger as

732
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:18,990
288 the absolute number gets bigger as
 

733
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,560
288 the absolute number gets bigger as
you go this way so I think that's how

734
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,570
you go this way so I think that's how
 

735
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,250
you go this way so I think that's how
you do it and so it ends at an odd

736
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,260
you do it and so it ends at an odd
 

737
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,520
you do it and so it ends at an odd
number 303 and then over here I believe

738
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,530
number 303 and then over here I believe
 

739
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,540
number 303 and then over here I believe
is the next chunk I think that's how it

740
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,550
is the next chunk I think that's how it
 

741
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,460
is the next chunk I think that's how it
works I could be wrong I hope I'm not

742
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,470
works I could be wrong I hope I'm not
 

743
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,870
works I could be wrong I hope I'm not
yeah that's this for today

744
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
yeah that's this for today
 

745
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,630
yeah that's this for today
I'll check the time and if we have some

746
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640
I'll check the time and if we have some
 

747
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,280
I'll check the time and if we have some
time left we'll do something else the

748
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,290
time left we'll do something else the
 

749
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,990
time left we'll do something else the
episodes being a little bit long but

750
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
episodes being a little bit long but
 

751
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,790
episodes being a little bit long but
we're gonna we're going to go exploring

752
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:49,800
we're gonna we're going to go exploring
 

753
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,710
we're gonna we're going to go exploring
for

754
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
for
 

755
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,430
for
maybe five minutes or so see what how

756
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,440
maybe five minutes or so see what how
 

757
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,989
maybe five minutes or so see what how
far we can get in five minutes

758
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:55,999
far we can get in five minutes
 

759
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,609
far we can get in five minutes
I actually don't do a whole lot of

760
00:21:59,609 --> 00:21:59,619
I actually don't do a whole lot of
 

761
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,989
I actually don't do a whole lot of
exploring off-camera I've kind of been

762
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:01,999
exploring off-camera I've kind of been
 

763
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:06,909
exploring off-camera I've kind of been
saving it for for the show because I

764
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:06,919
saving it for for the show because I
 

765
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,119
saving it for for the show because I
want you guys to see the world too so

766
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,129
want you guys to see the world too so
 

767
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,009
want you guys to see the world too so
that you can get an idea of the bearings

768
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:12,019
that you can get an idea of the bearings
 

769
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,639
that you can get an idea of the bearings
and all that but what I'm really looking

770
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:15,649
and all that but what I'm really looking
 

771
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:21,009
and all that but what I'm really looking
for is a snow biome I also want to check

772
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:21,019
for is a snow biome I also want to check
 

773
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,259
for is a snow biome I also want to check
out the mountains around here because

774
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:23,269
out the mountains around here because
 

775
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,989
out the mountains around here because
they're pretty amazing it would be

776
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:25,999
they're pretty amazing it would be
 

777
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,289
they're pretty amazing it would be
really nice to find a village just for

778
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:29,299
really nice to find a village just for
 

779
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:29,739
really nice to find a village just for
kicks

780
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:29,749
kicks
 

781
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,430
kicks
what else did I want to find stronghold

782
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
what else did I want to find stronghold
 

783
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,549
what else did I want to find stronghold
to put to knee tenderize for that which

784
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
to put to knee tenderize for that which
