some people say if you click a balk

12
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:25,939
some people say if you click a balk
 

13
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,269
some people say if you click a balk
instead of just like holding left-click

14
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
instead of just like holding left-click
 

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,139
instead of just like holding left-click
down if you just tap it you can break it

16
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:33,149
down if you just tap it you can break it
 

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,380
down if you just tap it you can break it
quicker doing that that's kind of cool

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,390
quicker doing that that's kind of cool
 

19

I want to point that out to you guys if

30
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,300
I want to point that out to you guys if
 

31
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,600
I want to point that out to you guys if
you haven't seen it before it's kind of

32
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,610
you haven't seen it before it's kind of
 

33
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,720
you haven't seen it before it's kind of
cool if you have just the right angle

34
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,730
cool if you have just the right angle
 

35
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,439
cool if you have just the right angle
and the right distance see if we can get

36
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,449
and the right distance see if we can get
 

37
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,780
and the right distance see if we can get
it I think it's like this you can just

38
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:05,790
it I think it's like this you can just
 

39
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,460
it I think it's like this you can just
walk along and it breaks it instantly

40
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:10,470
walk along and it breaks it instantly
 

41
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,740
walk along and it breaks it instantly
otherwise like if you have more of an

42
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,750
otherwise like if you have more of an
 

43
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,310
otherwise like if you have more of an
angle it's like this it's a lot slower

44
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,320
angle it's like this it's a lot slower
 

45
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,960
angle it's like this it's a lot slower
it's not watching speed that's for sure

46
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:17,970
it's not watching speed that's for sure
 

47
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,090
it's not watching speed that's for sure
I thought that was kind of cool good

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:27,750
already you can also do it on the sides
 

53
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,069
already you can also do it on the sides
if you get the right angle too it's a

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
if you get the right angle too it's a
 

55
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,510
if you get the right angle too it's a
little more challenging I haven't

56
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
little more challenging I haven't
 

57
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,480
little more challenging I haven't
mastered it it let's let's see if we can

58
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,490
mastered it it let's let's see if we can
 

59
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,940
mastered it it let's let's see if we can
do it yeah you see how it's breaking it

60
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:37,950
do it yeah you see how it's breaking it
 

61
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,889
do it yeah you see how it's breaking it
quick I don't know if I can do it on the

62
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:42,899
quick I don't know if I can do it on the
 

63
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,179
quick I don't know if I can do it on the
bottom I've just been messing around if

64
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:47,189
bottom I've just been messing around if
 

65
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,069
bottom I've just been messing around if
they trying to perfect it but that would

66
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
they trying to perfect it but that would
 

67
00:01:49,079 --> 00:02:02,060
they trying to perfect it but that would
save a lot of time mmm turkey it right

68
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
save a lot of time mmm turkey it right
 

69
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,639
save a lot of time mmm turkey it right
this picks stir and we're out there we

70
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:04,649
this picks stir and we're out there we
 

71
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,719
this picks stir and we're out there we
go so if you get just the right angle it

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:08,729
go so if you get just the right angle it
 

73
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,040
go so if you get just the right angle it
seems to work in the right distance

74
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,050
seems to work in the right distance
 

75
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,720
seems to work in the right distance
no it's really easy to do on the ceiling

76
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:13,730
no it's really easy to do on the ceiling
 

77
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,510
no it's really easy to do on the ceiling
though I'm finding if the block D is a

78
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
though I'm finding if the block D is a
 

79
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,870
though I'm finding if the block D is a
one block above your head OOP and that's

80
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:19,880
one block above your head OOP and that's
 

81
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,060
one block above your head OOP and that's
another common trick a lot of people

82
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,070
another common trick a lot of people
 

83
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,510
another common trick a lot of people
know like if you were to mine rabble if

84
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
know like if you were to mine rabble if
 

85
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,850
know like if you were to mine rabble if
you start at the top work your way down

86
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:27,860
you start at the top work your way down
 

87
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,090
you start at the top work your way down
it's slower than if say you let's let's

88
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,100
it's slower than if say you let's let's
 

89
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,190
it's slower than if say you let's let's
just make a statue you'd start at the

90
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,200
just make a statue you'd start at the
 

91
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,110
just make a statue you'd start at the
bottom one first and then keep holding

92
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,120
bottom one first and then keep holding
 

93
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,460
bottom one first and then keep holding
left-click didn't do it maybe I haven't

94
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,470
left-click didn't do it maybe I haven't
 

95
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,720
left-click didn't do it maybe I haven't
mastered this one either

96
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:46,730
mastered this one either
 

97
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,000
mastered this one either
so you probably need the right angle on

98
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,010
so you probably need the right angle on
 

99
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,830
so you probably need the right angle on
it too ouch oh I did it just for a

100
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
it too ouch oh I did it just for a
 

101
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,740
it too ouch oh I did it just for a
second there let's try it I think you

102
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,750
second there let's try it I think you
 

103
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,230
second there let's try it I think you
need a sharp angle like this maybe there

104
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,240
need a sharp angle like this maybe there
 

105
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,620
need a sharp angle like this maybe there
we go

106
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,630
we go
 

107
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,060
we go
see how it's much quicker when you do it

108
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,070
see how it's much quicker when you do it
 

109
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,699
see how it's much quicker when you do it
like that that's another trick in case

110
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,709
like that that's another trick in case
 

111
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:12,880
like that that's another trick in case
you didn't know I also got just going to

112
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:12,890
you didn't know I also got just going to
 

113
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,860
you didn't know I also got just going to
show off a new pic I got finally got

114
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:14,870
show off a new pic I got finally got
 

115
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,280
show off a new pic I got finally got
efficiency five I went to the where are

116
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,290
efficiency five I went to the where are
 

117
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,449
efficiency five I went to the where are
you at oh there's a tube up there oh

118
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:27,459
you at oh there's a tube up there oh
 

119
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:40,300
you at oh there's a tube up there oh
he's up there probably whoops

120
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,310

 

121
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,839

started on that what this is my yeah

122
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:44,849
started on that what this is my yeah
 

123
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,619
started on that what this is my yeah
efficiency five let's see how quick is

124
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:47,629
efficiency five let's see how quick is
 

125
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,140
efficiency five let's see how quick is
never had one of these before

126
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,150
never had one of these before
 

127
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:59,240
never had one of these before
not bad not bad at all I want to show

128
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,250
not bad not bad at all I want to show
 

129
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,089
not bad not bad at all I want to show
you how I'm doing my mining so I bring a

130
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,099
you how I'm doing my mining so I bring a
 

131
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,119
you how I'm doing my mining so I bring a
water bucket with me like I said before

132
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,129
water bucket with me like I said before
 

133
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,179
water bucket with me like I said before
I mined at ten point six but you're to

134
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:10,189

 

135
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,800

two levels below the lava level so

136
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
two levels below the lava level so
 

137
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,990
two levels below the lava level so
occasionally you'll run into pools like

138
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
occasionally you'll run into pools like
 

139
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,920
occasionally you'll run into pools like
this usually I'll just flood them like

140
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:18,930
this usually I'll just flood them like
 

141
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,550
this usually I'll just flood them like
that

142
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
that
 

143
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,550
that
then I'll mine out the top block first

144
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
then I'll mine out the top block first
 

145
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,980
then I'll mine out the top block first
with the efficiency pick just to speed

146
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:24,990
with the efficiency pick just to speed
 

147
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,700
with the efficiency pick just to speed
it up it gets faster with efficiency and

148
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:31,710
it up it gets faster with efficiency and
 

149
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,439
it up it gets faster with efficiency and
then you'll usually have lava underneath

150
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,449
then you'll usually have lava underneath
 

151
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,560
then you'll usually have lava underneath
this is a bad example there we go then

152
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,570
this is a bad example there we go then
 

153
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,710
this is a bad example there we go then
I'll just put water next to the block go

154
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
I'll just put water next to the block go
 

155
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,570
I'll just put water next to the block go
down be very careful of course and

156
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
down be very careful of course and
 

157
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,520
down be very careful of course and
that's how I do it so I just go over

158
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,530
that's how I do it so I just go over
 

159
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:57,500
that's how I do it so I just go over
here same thing and that way you get up

160
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,510
here same thing and that way you get up
 

161
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,719
here same thing and that way you get up
sitting into because maybe some projects

162
00:04:59,719 --> 00:04:59,729
sitting into because maybe some projects
 

163
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,140
sitting into because maybe some projects
need it it's not as big of a hassle

164
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,150
need it it's not as big of a hassle
 

165
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,839
need it it's not as big of a hassle
using it anymore so I don't mind having

166
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:05,849
using it anymore so I don't mind having
 

167
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,080
using it anymore so I don't mind having
a stockpile think I got three stacks of

168
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,090
a stockpile think I got three stacks of
 

169
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:17,020
a stockpile think I got three stacks of
it now just from doing this um what else

170
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,030

 

171
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,070

there was something else I was going to

172
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
there was something else I was going to
 

173
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,540
there was something else I was going to
show maybe we'll head back I want to

174
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,550
show maybe we'll head back I want to
 

175
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,360
show maybe we'll head back I want to
show off my awesome axis thing is

176
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,370
show off my awesome axis thing is
 

177
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,250
show off my awesome axis thing is
incredible oh yeah I was going to talk

178
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,260
incredible oh yeah I was going to talk
 

179
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,310
incredible oh yeah I was going to talk
about the efficiency 5 apparently

180
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,320
about the efficiency 5 apparently
 

181
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,409
about the efficiency 5 apparently
getting a high level when you do the

182
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:33,419
getting a high level when you do the
 

183
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,390
getting a high level when you do the
enchantment is really really important

184
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
enchantment is really really important
 

185
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,730
enchantment is really really important
if you're going for efficiency 5 and a

186
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:37,740
if you're going for efficiency 5 and a
 

187
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,589
if you're going for efficiency 5 and a
diamond tool and thanked at level 47 I

188
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:42,599
diamond tool and thanked at level 47 I
 

189
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:44,149
diamond tool and thanked at level 47 I
can't remember quite right but it's like

190
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:44,159
can't remember quite right but it's like
 

191
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,029
can't remember quite right but it's like
eight percent chance then if you go to

192
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:46,039
eight percent chance then if you go to
 

193
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:52,129
eight percent chance then if you go to
48 I think it's 11 percent then 49 it

194
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:52,139
48 I think it's 11 percent then 49 it
 

195
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,370
48 I think it's 11 percent then 49 it
jumps up the fifth

196
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,380
jumps up the fifth
 

197
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,140
jumps up the fifth
Dean and then if you do a level 50

198
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,150
Dean and then if you do a level 50
 

199
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,970
Dean and then if you do a level 50
enchantment it goes all the way up to 20

200
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:56,980
enchantment it goes all the way up to 20
 

201
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,600
enchantment it goes all the way up to 20
so it increases really quick you really

202
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:00,610
so it increases really quick you really
 

203
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,860
so it increases really quick you really
want to have a high level if you're

204
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:01,870
want to have a high level if you're
 

205
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,250
want to have a high level if you're
aiming for efficiency 5 but if you're

206
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,260
aiming for efficiency 5 but if you're
 

207
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,130
aiming for efficiency 5 but if you're
using a gold tool getting efficiency 5

208
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,140
using a gold tool getting efficiency 5
 

209
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,200
using a gold tool getting efficiency 5
is significantly easier I think that

210
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,210
is significantly easier I think that
 

211
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,350
is significantly easier I think that
level 50 there's a 49 or 50 percent

212
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,360
level 50 there's a 49 or 50 percent
 

213
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,830
level 50 there's a 49 or 50 percent
chance of getting efficiency 5 so big

214
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
chance of getting efficiency 5 so big
 

215
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,630
chance of getting efficiency 5 so big
difference um yeah let's head back and

216
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:24,640
difference um yeah let's head back and
 

217
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,550
difference um yeah let's head back and
in the description if I remember I'll

218

link you to the website I use for all
 

221
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:35,640
link you to the website I use for all
the efficiency statistics ok ok here we

222
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,650
the efficiency statistics ok ok here we
 

223
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:35,970
the efficiency statistics ok ok here we
go

224
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:35,980
go
 

225
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,520
go
we're going to try it out show it off

226
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,530
we're going to try it out show it off
 

227
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,550
we're going to try it out show it off

actually use a tree farm or if it's just

236
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,330
actually use a tree farm or if it's just
 

237
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,620

241
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,530
you guys down some more in here so it's
not just for looks I do use it now the

242
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:01,540
not just for looks I do use it now the
 

243
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,630
not just for looks I do use it now the
problem with this axe oh it's almost

244
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:03,640
problem with this axe oh it's almost
 

245
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,250
problem with this axe oh it's almost
it's almost too good because I if I just

246
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,260
it's almost too good because I if I just
 

247
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,110
it's almost too good because I if I just
raise these pumpkins it takes them out

248
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,120
raise these pumpkins it takes them out
 

249
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,630
raise these pumpkins it takes them out
like instantly and it I don't know I

250
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:15,640
like instantly and it I don't know I
 

251
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,340
like instantly and it I don't know I
have to be careful with it because this

252
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,350
have to be careful with it because this
 

253
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,860
have to be careful with it because this
is so crazy

254
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:19,870
is so crazy
 

255
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,560
is so crazy
I leave this it's like so fast because a

256
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,570
I leave this it's like so fast because a
 

257
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,990
I leave this it's like so fast because a
pumpkin harvest quit just with an axe I

258
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
pumpkin harvest quit just with an axe I
 

259
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,430
pumpkin harvest quit just with an axe I
think so might actually changes with

260
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,440
think so might actually changes with
 

261
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
think so might actually changes with
glowstone just for that reason some

262
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,450
glowstone just for that reason some
 

263
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,080
glowstone just for that reason some
people said they like the pumpkins more

264
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,090
people said they like the pumpkins more
 

265
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,500
people said they like the pumpkins more
umm I don't I like low stone more that's

266
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:40,510
umm I don't I like low stone more that's
 

267
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,190
umm I don't I like low stone more that's
just me but the pumpkins are a lot

268
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,200
just me but the pumpkins are a lot
 

269
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,330
just me but the pumpkins are a lot
cheaper and you know me I'm a cheapskate

270
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340
cheaper and you know me I'm a cheapskate
 

271
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,620
cheaper and you know me I'm a cheapskate
but I don't mind using glowstone I got

272
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,630
but I don't mind using glowstone I got
 

273
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,140
but I don't mind using glowstone I got
lots of little stone now yeah we should

274
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,150
lots of little stone now yeah we should
 

275
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,560
lots of little stone now yeah we should
try see if that trick works with regular

276
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:58,570
try see if that trick works with regular
 

277
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,390
try see if that trick works with regular
tools - I bet you it does on my potion

278
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:03,400
tools - I bet you it does on my potion
 

279
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,210
tools - I bet you it does on my potion
ran out where should we do it need some

280
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,220
ran out where should we do it need some
 

281
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,269
ran out where should we do it need some
space

282
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:07,279
space
 

283
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,789
space
to me trees in the way oh we should try

284
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:12,799
to me trees in the way oh we should try
 

285
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,619
to me trees in the way oh we should try
to do that trick with the Pope with a

286
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:14,629
to do that trick with the Pope with a
 

287
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,669
to do that trick with the Pope with a
swiftness potion - okay here's a good

288
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:18,679
swiftness potion - okay here's a good
 

289
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:25,569
swiftness potion - okay here's a good
place let's set up some of these we're

290
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:25,579
place let's set up some of these we're
 

291
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,219
place let's set up some of these we're
just trying to master the basics of

292
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:27,229
just trying to master the basics of
 

293
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:30,749
just trying to master the basics of
Minecraft here that's what we're doing

294
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:30,759
Minecraft here that's what we're doing
 

295
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,139
Minecraft here that's what we're doing
no that was pretty slow felt like the

296
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:35,149
no that was pretty slow felt like the
 

297
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:42,009
no that was pretty slow felt like the
right angle there Oh does work

298
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:42,019
right angle there Oh does work
 

299
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:51,790
right angle there Oh does work
Aereo incredible clean that out a little

300
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:51,800
Aereo incredible clean that out a little
 

301
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,449
Aereo incredible clean that out a little
bit we'll set up another one this is

302
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:55,459
bit we'll set up another one this is
 

303
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,129
bit we'll set up another one this is
actually a really bad spot for it though

304
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:57,139
actually a really bad spot for it though
 

305
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,199
actually a really bad spot for it though
oh we got a nice wall here let's do it

306
00:08:59,199 --> 00:08:59,209
oh we got a nice wall here let's do it
 

307
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,040
oh we got a nice wall here let's do it
here so set up a long line and then

308
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,050
here so set up a long line and then
 

309
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,929
here so set up a long line and then
we'll do the swiftness potion on it

310
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:06,939
we'll do the swiftness potion on it
 

311
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:10,170
we'll do the swiftness potion on it
because if you can go at super speed and

312
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,180
because if you can go at super speed and
 

313
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,389
because if you can go at super speed and
have an instant that would be incredible

314
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:15,399

 

315
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,400

just try that the mines actually okay I

316
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,410
just try that the mines actually okay I
 

317
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,759
just try that the mines actually okay I
think it's about was working what

318
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:27,769
think it's about was working what
 

319

Oh terrible we had it going for like

326
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:48,649
Oh terrible we had it going for like
 

327
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,799
Oh terrible we had it going for like
just a split second there there we go

328
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:53,809
just a split second there there we go
 

329
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:57,009
just a split second there there we go
there we go when I got to the cobweb it

330
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:57,019
there we go when I got to the cobweb it
 

331
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,170
there we go when I got to the cobweb it
seems to kill it for some reason

332
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,180
seems to kill it for some reason
 

333
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,850
seems to kill it for some reason
you notice that both times it was at the

to do that sometimes I hope you don't
hate it the reason I want to find a

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:45,529
hate it the reason I want to find a
 

359
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,780
hate it the reason I want to find a
stronghold today is because I got an

the comments he said you can use

366
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,270
the comments he said you can use
 

367
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,300
the comments he said you can use
trigonometry to find strongholds and

368
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,310
trigonometry to find strongholds and
 

369
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,810
trigonometry to find strongholds and
that makes perfect sense so normally the

370
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:01,820
that makes perfect sense so normally the
 

371
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,280
that makes perfect sense so normally the
way people normally do it is they throw

372
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,290
way people normally do it is they throw
 

373
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,440
way people normally do it is they throw
an ender eye it travels in the direction

374
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,450
an ender eye it travels in the direction
 

375
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,320
an ender eye it travels in the direction
of a stronghold you follow that

376
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,330
of a stronghold you follow that
 

377
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,680
of a stronghold you follow that
direction and then like every you know a

378
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,690
direction and then like every you know a
 

379
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,000
direction and then like every you know a
few hundred blocks you'll throw another

380
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,010
few hundred blocks you'll throw another
 

381
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,329
few hundred blocks you'll throw another
ender IED and see if you should still

382
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:16,339
ender IED and see if you should still
 

383
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,590
ender IED and see if you should still
keep going in that direction but it

384
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:20,600
keep going in that direction but it
 

385
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,500
keep going in that direction but it
should be possible to find it I drink

386
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,510
should be possible to find it I drink
 

387
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,440
should be possible to find it I drink
one of these it should be possible to

388
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,450
one of these it should be possible to
 

389
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,660
one of these it should be possible to
find the stronghold throwing only two

390
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:28,670
find the stronghold throwing only two
 

391
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,240
find the stronghold throwing only two
under eyes and that's the challenge for

392
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,250
under eyes and that's the challenge for
 

393
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,680
under eyes and that's the challenge for
today I want to see if I can actually do

394
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:32,690
today I want to see if I can actually do
 

395
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,380
today I want to see if I can actually do
it so I'm going to pick a spot this is

396
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,390
it so I'm going to pick a spot this is
 

397
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,920
it so I'm going to pick a spot this is
our first point we're going to use try

398
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:38,930
our first point we're going to use try
 

399
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,590
our first point we're going to use try
to use trigonometry to do this okay

400
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
to use trigonometry to do this okay
 

401
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,370
to use trigonometry to do this okay
let's see which way it goes where it

402
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,380
let's see which way it goes where it
 

403
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:53,290
let's see which way it goes where it
lands throw it up right there don't land

404
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,300
lands throw it up right there don't land
 

405
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,490
lands throw it up right there don't land
on the cactus okay so roughly this angle

406
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:57,500
on the cactus okay so roughly this angle
 

407
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,889
on the cactus okay so roughly this angle
here I'm going to mark my coordinates I

408
00:11:59,889 --> 00:11:59,899
here I'm going to mark my coordinates I
 

409
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,540
here I'm going to mark my coordinates I
don't know if I can do this this is a

410
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,550
don't know if I can do this this is a
 

411
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,240
don't know if I can do this this is a
challenge for me a lot of people think

412
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,250
challenge for me a lot of people think
 

413
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,769
challenge for me a lot of people think
I'm smart I really am NOT in fact when I

414

finished high school I within a year

416
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
finished high school I within a year
 

417
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,069
finished high school I within a year
I've completely had no idea how to do

418
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:15,079
I've completely had no idea how to do
 

419
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,600
I've completely had no idea how to do
trigonometry the only reason I know how

420
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:16,610
trigonometry the only reason I know how
 

421
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,699
trigonometry the only reason I know how
to do it today and even today I don't

422
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:18,709
to do it today and even today I don't
 

423
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,530
to do it today and even today I don't
know how to do it very well is because

424
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:20,540
know how to do it very well is because
 

425
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,110
know how to do it very well is because

of programming video game programming
 

427
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,510
of programming video game programming
it's the only reason I know it still but

428
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:28,520
it's the only reason I know it still but
 

429
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,519
it's the only reason I know it still but
I might not figure this out we'll see so

430
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:30,529
I might not figure this out we'll see so
 

431
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,710
I might not figure this out we'll see so
now I'm going to mark this point

432

actually I might okay so I think I might

436
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,430
actually I might okay so I think I might
 

437
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,020
actually I might okay so I think I might
need it to figure out the angle now I'm

438
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,030
need it to figure out the angle now I'm

over here and doing that we should be

446
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:03,520
over here and doing that we should be
 

447
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,580
over here and doing that we should be
able to figure out using the angle and

448
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:05,590
able to figure out using the angle and
 

449
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,530
able to figure out using the angle and

the points two points where we throw it
 

451
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,640
the points two points where we throw it
we should be able to find the Third

452
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,650
we should be able to find the Third

intersect and that's where the
 

457
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,450
intersect and that's where the
stronghold should be if I understood

458
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,460
stronghold should be if I understood
 

459
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,350
stronghold should be if I understood
that properly

460
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:22,360
that properly

okay this looks like a but about the

540
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,300
okay this looks like a but about the
 

541
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,820
okay this looks like a but about the
right angle like I said I don't even

542
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:35,830
right angle like I said I don't even
 

543
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,410
right angle like I said I don't even
know if I need this extra point here but

544
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,420
know if I need this extra point here but
 

545
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,160
know if I need this extra point here but
just in case they do I'm going to take

546
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,170
just in case they do I'm going to take
 

547
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,840
just in case they do I'm going to take
it okay oops

548
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:48,850
it okay oops
 

549
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,350
it okay oops
so now I'm going to pause the game and

550
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,360
so now I'm going to pause the game and
 

551
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,210
so now I'm going to pause the game and
see if I can figure out where this

552
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:54,220
see if I can figure out where this
 

553
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,910
see if I can figure out where this
stronghold is from that and I'm sure

554
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:56,920
stronghold is from that and I'm sure
 

555
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,560
stronghold is from that and I'm sure
it's possible but I might be too dumb to

556
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,570
it's possible but I might be too dumb to
 

557
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,250
it's possible but I might be too dumb to
figure it out so we'll see what we can

558
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,260
figure it out so we'll see what we can
 

559
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,730
figure it out so we'll see what we can
do

560
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:04,740

 

561
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,350

I'm king of the world

562
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm king of the world
 

563
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,540
I'm king of the world
yeah woo ah I figured it out I I hope I

564
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:15,550
yeah woo ah I figured it out I I hope I
 

565
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,210
yeah woo ah I figured it out I I hope I
did I guess you do you do need those

566
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,220
did I guess you do you do need those
 

567
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,970
did I guess you do you do need those
second points they're important I should

568
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:20,980
second points they're important I should
 

569
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,770
second points they're important I should
have been more careful or more accurate

570
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:22,780
have been more careful or more accurate
 

571
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,559
have been more careful or more accurate
figuring them out but hopefully we'll

572
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:25,569
figuring them out but hopefully we'll
 

573
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,890
figuring them out but hopefully we'll
get it right it seems the lines

574
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:28,900
get it right it seems the lines
 

575
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:35,550
get it right it seems the lines
intersect at X 236 what's that noise

576
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:35,560
intersect at X 236 what's that noise
 

577
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,530
intersect at X 236 what's that noise
coming from there is a lot of creepers

578
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:40,540
coming from there is a lot of creepers
 

579
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,070
coming from there is a lot of creepers
out here they intersect at X 236

580
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
out here they intersect at X 236
 

581
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,750
out here they intersect at X 236
according to my calculations and why

582
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:48,760
according to my calculations and why
 

583
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,020
according to my calculations and why
there another one why can it be out why

584
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,030
there another one why can it be out why
 

585
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,500
there another one why can it be out why
a 190 so 236 and 190 is where we need to

586
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:01,510
a 190 so 236 and 190 is where we need to
 

587
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,580
a 190 so 236 and 190 is where we need to
go and I'm just going to throw another

588
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,590
go and I'm just going to throw another
 

589
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,160
go and I'm just going to throw another
ender eye just to see that's the general

590
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,170
ender eye just to see that's the general
 

591
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,250
ender eye just to see that's the general
direction it's taking us so let's figure

592
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,260
direction it's taking us so let's figure
 

593
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,670
direction it's taking us so let's figure
out where the numbers get bigger

594
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:10,680
out where the numbers get bigger
 

595
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,860
out where the numbers get bigger
no we need Zed to get smaller so that

596
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:13,870
no we need Zed to get smaller so that
 

597
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,150
no we need Zed to get smaller so that
way and we need Y to get our X to get

598
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
way and we need Y to get our X to get
 

599
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,210
way and we need Y to get our X to get
bigger

600
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,220
bigger
 

601
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,290
bigger
I think I said why before I meant said

602
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:23,300
I think I said why before I meant said
 

603
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,990
I think I said why before I meant said
because this team has goofy coordinate

604
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
because this team has goofy coordinate
 

605
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,880
because this team has goofy coordinate
system so we need should be roughly this

606
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,890
system so we need should be roughly this
 

607
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:41,910
system so we need should be roughly this
direction dang it

608
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:41,920
direction dang it
 

609
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,140
direction dang it
wait how did I get that wrong unless

610
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,150
wait how did I get that wrong unless
 

611
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,850
wait how did I get that wrong unless
we're picking up a different lunch and

612
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:51,860
we're picking up a different lunch and
 

613
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,590
we're picking up a different lunch and
let's do it I'm going to let that point

614
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
let's do it I'm going to let that point
 

615
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,830
let's do it I'm going to let that point
anyway and we'll see what happens

616
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:58,840

 

617
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,620

I'm guessing I got one of the signs

634
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm guessing I got one of the signs
 

635
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,130
I'm guessing I got one of the signs
