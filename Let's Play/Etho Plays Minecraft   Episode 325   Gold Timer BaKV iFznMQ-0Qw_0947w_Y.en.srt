oh
 

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,549
oh
man i forgot about the cinematic key

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
man i forgot about the cinematic key
 

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,710
man i forgot about the cinematic key
slow motion camera oh yeah

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
slow motion camera oh yeah

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,870
slow motion camera oh yeah
it's not enabled by default anymore i

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
it's not enabled by default anymore i
 

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,550
it's not enabled by default anymore i
actually had to turn it on the keyboard

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
actually had to turn it on the keyboard
 

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,670
actually had to turn it on the keyboard
that's why i don't use it

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
that's why i don't use it
 

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,589
that's why i don't use it
anymore i don't think or i haven't used

16
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
anymore i don't think or i haven't used
 

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,269
anymore i don't think or i haven't used
in a long time oh i can go down the

in a long time oh i can go down the
 

19
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:27,990
in a long time oh i can go down the
ladder

20
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
ladder
 

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,550
ladder
do you see that i went down the ladder

22
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
do you see that i went down the ladder
 

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,590
do you see that i went down the ladder
guys

25
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,270

oh it's been a long time since i did a

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
oh it's been a long time since i did a
 

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,910
oh it's been a long time since i did a
cinematic intro and it'll probably

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
cinematic intro and it'll probably
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,590
cinematic intro and it'll probably
never happen again because it's so corny

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
never happen again because it's so corny
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,630
never happen again because it's so corny
so welcome back guys this is etho

so welcome back guys this is etho
i am in the nether uh some of you

34
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
i am in the nether uh some of you
 

35
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,350
i am in the nether uh some of you
probably know where i am i'm

36
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
probably know where i am i'm
 

37
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,750
probably know where i am i'm
like way up in the sky wait a minute

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
like way up in the sky wait a minute
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,709
like way up in the sky wait a minute
let's get let's

40
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
let's get let's
 

41
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,310
let's get let's
let's get out of this camera mode there

42
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
let's get out of this camera mode there
 

43
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,549
let's get out of this camera mode there
that's better way up in the sky

44
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
that's better way up in the sky
 

45
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,430
that's better way up in the sky
uh this is where i stand to enable my

46
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
uh this is where i stand to enable my
 

47
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,549
uh this is where i stand to enable my
gold form to the zombie pigmen spawning

48
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
gold form to the zombie pigmen spawning
 

49
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,310
gold form to the zombie pigmen spawning
and i've built a little contraption up

50
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
and i've built a little contraption up
 

51
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,830
and i've built a little contraption up
here i'm pressing all

52
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
here i'm pressing all
 

53
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,950
here i'm pressing all
sorts of f1 f5 keys here

54
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
sorts of f1 f5 keys here
 

55
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,990
sorts of f1 f5 keys here
okay this is the view i want so

56
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
okay this is the view i want so
 

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,390
okay this is the view i want so
i built a little redstone contraption up

58
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
i built a little redstone contraption up
 

59
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,149
i built a little redstone contraption up
here let me show you this real quick

60
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
here let me show you this real quick
 

61
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,670
here let me show you this real quick
uh basically uh

62
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
uh basically uh
 

63
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,789
uh basically uh
if i'm here i and i'm here too long

64
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
if i'm here i and i'm here too long
 

65
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,749
if i'm here i and i'm here too long
too many zombie pigmen will spawn and my

66
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
too many zombie pigmen will spawn and my
 

67
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,550
too many zombie pigmen will spawn and my
game will get

68
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
game will get
 

69
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,550
game will get
very laggy and i might not be able to

70
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
very laggy and i might not be able to
 

71
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,310
very laggy and i might not be able to
kill them if i'm here too

72
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
kill them if i'm here too
 

73
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,830
kill them if i'm here too
short not enough will spawn and i

74
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
short not enough will spawn and i
 

75
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,190
short not enough will spawn and i
it'll kind of be a waste of time it

76
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
it'll kind of be a waste of time it
 

77
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,109
it'll kind of be a waste of time it
won't be very efficient

78
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
won't be very efficient
 

79
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,069
won't be very efficient
so i decided to install a timer here

80
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
so i decided to install a timer here
 

81
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,630
so i decided to install a timer here
to precisely time how long i'm here and

82
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
to precisely time how long i'm here and
 

83
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,389
to precisely time how long i'm here and
then

84
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
then
 

85
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,310
then
when the time is up this piston extends

86
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
when the time is up this piston extends
 

87
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,910
when the time is up this piston extends
and knocks me down the hole here

88
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
and knocks me down the hole here
 

89
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,109
and knocks me down the hole here
and drops me down to

90
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
and drops me down to
 

91
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,710
and drops me down to
a place where they'll stop spawning

92
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
a place where they'll stop spawning
 

93
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,950
a place where they'll stop spawning
basically is the goal of this thing

94
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
basically is the goal of this thing
 

95
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,789
basically is the goal of this thing
oh yeah by the way don't forget to get

96
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
oh yeah by the way don't forget to get
 

97
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,990
oh yeah by the way don't forget to get
your snacks guys

98
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
your snacks guys
 

99
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,229
your snacks guys
i got coffee and milk chocolate here

100
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
i got coffee and milk chocolate here
 

101
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,670
i got coffee and milk chocolate here
ah so good that was my last sip

102
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
ah so good that was my last sip
 

103
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,190
ah so good that was my last sip
uh yeah so basically

104
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
uh yeah so basically
 

105
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,309
uh yeah so basically
got the hopper timer here then inside

106
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
got the hopper timer here then inside
 

107
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,830
got the hopper timer here then inside
these two droppers this is like a

108
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
these two droppers this is like a
 

109
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,589
these two droppers this is like a
counter

110
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
counter
 

111
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,750
counter
when i press this wood button it sends

112
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
when i press this wood button it sends
 

113
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,030
when i press this wood button it sends
seven pulses

114
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
seven pulses
 

115
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,750
seven pulses
to this wire this is a comparator clock

116
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
to this wire this is a comparator clock
 

117
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,710
to this wire this is a comparator clock
that makes

118
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
that makes
 

119
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,589
that makes
these seven items go into this dropper

120
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
these seven items go into this dropper
 

121
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,830
these seven items go into this dropper
and then that powers this

122
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
and then that powers this
 

123
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,750
and then that powers this
and it unpowers this so the piston

124
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
and it unpowers this so the piston
 

125
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,030
and it unpowers this so the piston
retracts

126
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
retracts
 

127
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,470
retracts
and also that turns on this timer this

128
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
and also that turns on this timer this
 

129
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,750
and also that turns on this timer this
timer can then run

130
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
timer can then run
 

131
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,550
timer can then run
and every time it it goes back and forth

132
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
and every time it it goes back and forth
 

133
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470
and every time it it goes back and forth
it sends one pulse here

134
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
it sends one pulse here
 

135
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,790
it sends one pulse here
which sends items from this dropper back

136
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
which sends items from this dropper back
 

137
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,670
which sends items from this dropper back
into this one

138
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
into this one
 

139
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,190
into this one
so

140
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200

 

141
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,070

that way this whole thing can reset a

142
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
that way this whole thing can reset a
 

143
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,710
that way this whole thing can reset a
lot

144
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
lot
 

145
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,630
lot
better than if it was like a straight up

146
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
better than if it was like a straight up
 

147
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,430
better than if it was like a straight up
10 15 minute timer sort of thing

148
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
10 15 minute timer sort of thing
 

149
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,869
10 15 minute timer sort of thing
but basically hit the button

150
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879

 

151
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,550

my game is lagging a lot um

152
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
my game is lagging a lot um
 

153
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,750
my game is lagging a lot um
by the way maybe i'll take a few of

154
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
by the way maybe i'll take a few of
 

155
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,910
by the way maybe i'll take a few of
these items out i haven't

156
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
these items out i haven't
 

157
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,509
these items out i haven't
timed this quite right yet either

158
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
timed this quite right yet either
 

159
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,910
timed this quite right yet either
i just finished setting it up here so

160
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
i just finished setting it up here so
 

161
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,750
i just finished setting it up here so
it's not set for 10 minutes right now

162
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
it's not set for 10 minutes right now
 

163
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,030
it's not set for 10 minutes right now
it's set for

164
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
it's set for
 

165
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,270
it's set for
probably less than one but we'll get

166
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
probably less than one but we'll get
 

167
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,270
probably less than one but we'll get
into position this is like my aft

168
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
into position this is like my aft
 

169
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,030
into position this is like my aft
spot and i haven't tested these

170
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
spot and i haven't tested these
 

171
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,830
spot and i haven't tested these
ladders out i have some further down but

172
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
ladders out i have some further down but
 

173
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,830
ladders out i have some further down but
this might be

174
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
this might be
 

175
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,949
this might be
an amazing splat if it doesn't work if

176
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
an amazing splat if it doesn't work if
 

177
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,869
an amazing splat if it doesn't work if
the ladders don't catch me down below

178
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
the ladders don't catch me down below
 

179
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,390
the ladders don't catch me down below
i'm just gonna hit the ground

180
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400

 

181
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,670

so hopefully this goes pretty quick

182
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680

 

183
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,430

basically the game is lagging right now

184
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
basically the game is lagging right now
 

185
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,110
basically the game is lagging right now
because the zombie pigmen are going

186
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
because the zombie pigmen are going
 

187
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,229
because the zombie pigmen are going
through the portal

188
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
through the portal
 

189
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,830
through the portal
and the game doesn't have very good

190
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
and the game doesn't have very good
 

191
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,750
and the game doesn't have very good
code well it's it's not that the code is

192
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
code well it's it's not that the code is
 

193
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,589
code well it's it's not that the code is
bad but there's no

194
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
bad but there's no
 

195
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,429
bad but there's no
it doesn't save anything in the game to

196
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
it doesn't save anything in the game to
 

197
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,509
it doesn't save anything in the game to
tell where the portals are so it's got

198
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
tell where the portals are so it's got
 

199
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,110
tell where the portals are so it's got
to figure it out every time

200
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
to figure it out every time
 

201
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,270
to figure it out every time
and that is an extremely costly

202
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and that is an extremely costly
 

203
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,309
and that is an extremely costly
operation in the game code so it lags

204
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
operation in the game code so it lags
 

205
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,710
operation in the game code so it lags
incredibly when i'm up here because it's

206
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
incredibly when i'm up here because it's
 

207
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,150
incredibly when i'm up here because it's
got to figure out where portals are

208
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160

 

209
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,909

many times a second because there's so

210
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
many times a second because there's so
 

211
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,629
many times a second because there's so
many zombie pigmen going through

212
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
many zombie pigmen going through
 

213
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,189
many zombie pigmen going through
um should go pretty soon you see like

214
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
um should go pretty soon you see like
 

215
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,030
um should go pretty soon you see like
how the piston is

216
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
how the piston is
 

217
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,629
how the piston is
disappearing and reappearing i've

218
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
disappearing and reappearing i've
 

219
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,230
disappearing and reappearing i've
actually been up here for

220
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
actually been up here for
 

221
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,270
actually been up here for
probably too long

222
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
probably too long
 

223
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,030
probably too long
because i built the thing up here and i

224
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
because i built the thing up here and i
 

225
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,469
because i built the thing up here and i
haven't been down since so there might

226
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
haven't been down since so there might
 

227
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,590
haven't been down since so there might
be a ton of

228
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
be a ton of
 

229
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,110
be a ton of
zombie pigmens in the gold farm

230
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120

 

231
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,790

ah that's kind of awkward isn't it

232
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
ah that's kind of awkward isn't it
 

233
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,390
ah that's kind of awkward isn't it
i was kind of hoping to get pushed down

234
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
i was kind of hoping to get pushed down
 

235
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,150
i was kind of hoping to get pushed down
by now but uh

236
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160

 

237
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,430

let's go down the ladder one more time

238
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
let's go down the ladder one more time
 

239
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,030
let's go down the ladder one more time
i have maybe you guys should go read a

240
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
i have maybe you guys should go read a
 

241
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,629
i have maybe you guys should go read a
newspaper or something until

242
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
newspaper or something until
 

243
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,670
newspaper or something until
until this happens come on

244
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
until this happens come on
 

245
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,350
until this happens come on
how much longer it might go this time i

246
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
how much longer it might go this time i
 

247
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,790
how much longer it might go this time i
think it's going to go this time

248
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800

 

249
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,469

come on come on come on

250
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479

 

251
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,029

uh-oh oh it didn't go good

252
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
uh-oh oh it didn't go good
 

253
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,990
uh-oh oh it didn't go good
catch me oh they catch me good very good

254
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
catch me oh they catch me good very good
 

255
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,189
catch me oh they catch me good very good
that would have been

256
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
that would have been
 

257
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,070
that would have been
pretty sad if i lost 47 levels anyway

258
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
pretty sad if i lost 47 levels anyway
 

259
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,670
pretty sad if i lost 47 levels anyway
let's go through the portal

260
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
let's go through the portal
 

261
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,990
let's go through the portal
see what's going on over there i might

262
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
see what's going on over there i might
 

263
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,749
see what's going on over there i might
have to stop recording here if it's too

264
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
have to stop recording here if it's too
 

265
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,670
have to stop recording here if it's too
laggy

266
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
laggy
 

267
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,830
laggy
hey guy oh whoa

268
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

269
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,830

oh i should have got out of this f5 mode

270
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
oh i should have got out of this f5 mode
 

271
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,430
oh i should have got out of this f5 mode
i don't know what's going on

272
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440

 

273
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,270

let's go down okay that's much better

274
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
let's go down okay that's much better
 

275
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,430
let's go down okay that's much better
let's push this guy off

276
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440

 

277
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,150

it's like a zombie pigman laser beam i

278
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
it's like a zombie pigman laser beam i
 

279
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,590
it's like a zombie pigman laser beam i
love it

280

much better than my old one
my old one everything was just frozen

286
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
my old one everything was just frozen
 

287
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,550
my old one everything was just frozen
when i'd go through and now

288
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
when i'd go through and now
 

289
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,390
when i'd go through and now
it's actually animating all these zombie

290
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
it's actually animating all these zombie
 

291
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,590
it's actually animating all these zombie
pigmen and

292
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
pigmen and
 

293
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,590
pigmen and
it's pretty pretty powerful

294
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
it's pretty pretty powerful
 

295
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,870
it's pretty pretty powerful
stars are twitching what are we at

296
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
stars are twitching what are we at
 

297
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,189
stars are twitching what are we at
1300 i don't think it's gonna be able to

298
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
1300 i don't think it's gonna be able to
 

299
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,350
1300 i don't think it's gonna be able to
handle that though to be honest

300
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
handle that though to be honest
 

301
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,029
handle that though to be honest
we'll try it

302
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039

 

303
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,230

i don't even know if i can press the

304

where's the button

308
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
where's the button

oh it's on the red clay yeah i'm not
supposed to let this many spawn

312
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
supposed to let this many spawn
 

313
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,070
supposed to let this many spawn
i think i hit it

314
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
i think i hit it
 

315
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,150
i think i hit it
i love this the synchronized grumbling

316
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160

 

317
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,749

yeah this isn't going to go over too
 

319
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,150
yeah this isn't going to go over too
well i can tell you all that already

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
well i can tell you all that already
 

321
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,589
well i can tell you all that already
we'll try it

322
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
we'll try it
 

323
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,560
we'll try it
it's running so slow oh

503
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,870
some some area over here with books and
maybe tables

504
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
maybe tables
 

505
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,829
maybe tables
could be cool uh and then it's gonna

506
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
could be cool uh and then it's gonna
 

507
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,870
could be cool uh and then it's gonna
most likely dead

508
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
most likely dead
 

509
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,990
most likely dead
end here same with the other side

510
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
end here same with the other side
 

511
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
end here same with the other side
pretty much just doing a mirror both

512
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
pretty much just doing a mirror both
 

513
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,630
pretty much just doing a mirror both
sides just because it's a lot easier to

514
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
sides just because it's a lot easier to
 

515
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,150
sides just because it's a lot easier to
to build this because it's such a large

516
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
to build this because it's such a large
 

517
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,870
to build this because it's such a large
structure otherwise

518
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
structure otherwise
 

519
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,230
structure otherwise
um but as i was working on the walkways

520
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
um but as i was working on the walkways
 

521
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,949
um but as i was working on the walkways
i

522
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
i
 

523
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,630
i
decided we really need to get a

524
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
decided we really need to get a
 

525
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,389
decided we really need to get a
staircase

526
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
staircase
 

527
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,190
staircase
up up to here down down to the the first

528
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
up up to here down down to the the first
 

529
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,829
up up to here down down to the the first
floor

530
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
floor
 

531
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,430
floor
at the moment there's no door on the

532
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
at the moment there's no door on the
 

533
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,310
at the moment there's no door on the
first floor so there's no actual way to

534
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
first floor so there's no actual way to
 

535
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,630
first floor so there's no actual way to
get

536
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
get
 

537
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,470
get
down to the ground level

538
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
down to the ground level
 

539
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,389
down to the ground level
so we should get a staircase going i

540
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
so we should get a staircase going i
 

541
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,069
so we should get a staircase going i
will most likely put a door in here

542
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
will most likely put a door in here
 

543
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,509
will most likely put a door in here
somewhere though

544
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519

 

545
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,910

so i figure let's do a staircase

546
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
so i figure let's do a staircase
 

547
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,470
so i figure let's do a staircase
in the middle of this so

548
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480

 

549
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,750

let's see maybe we will see

550
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
let's see maybe we will see
 

551
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,350
let's see maybe we will see
one two three

552
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
one two three
 

553
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,790
one two three
could start it there

554
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800

 

555
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,030

let's go one more block actually

556
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040

 

557
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,509

because that way there's a one two three

558
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
because that way there's a one two three
 

559
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,509
because that way there's a one two three
four five there's a three block space

560
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
four five there's a three block space
 

561
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,629
four five there's a three block space
between

562
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
between
 

563
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,949
between
this and where the pillar should be so

564
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
this and where the pillar should be so
 

565
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,829
this and where the pillar should be so
we'll start our staircase

566
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
we'll start our staircase
 

567
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,150
we'll start our staircase
here and most likely let's see how this

568
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
here and most likely let's see how this
 

569
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,310
here and most likely let's see how this
lays out

570
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
lays out
 

571
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,030
lays out
uh probably want at least three stairs

572
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040

 

573
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,389

i like to build like three by three

574
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
i like to build like three by three
 

575
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,509
i like to build like three by three
or odd numbers usually so

576
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
or odd numbers usually so
 

577
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,269
or odd numbers usually so
that's pretty much how i'm going to do

578
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
that's pretty much how i'm going to do
 

579
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,710
that's pretty much how i'm going to do
this i'm just going to put a 3x3

580
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
this i'm just going to put a 3x3
 

581
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,550
this i'm just going to put a 3x3
platform

582
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
platform
 

583
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,310
platform
up here now

584
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320

 

585
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,829

i really like these t staircases too

586
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
i really like these t staircases too
 

587
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,990
i really like these t staircases too
so we're going to continue it then going

588
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
so we're going to continue it then going
 

589
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,269
so we're going to continue it then going
up this way

590
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
up this way
 

591
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,269
up this way
on this side and on the other side as

592
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
on this side and on the other side as
 

593
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,030
on this side and on the other side as
well

594
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
well
 

595
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,629
well
if we do three more stairs does that

596
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
if we do three more stairs does that
 

597
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,110
if we do three more stairs does that
take us up to the right height

598
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
take us up to the right height
 

599
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,790
take us up to the right height
no we gotta go one more i think that's

600
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
no we gotta go one more i think that's
 

601
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,829
no we gotta go one more i think that's
fine though

602
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839

 

603
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,389

okay so now this should connect

604
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399

 

605
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,470

that was actually that was really lucky

606
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
that was actually that was really lucky
 

607
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,550
that was actually that was really lucky
look uh if it went

608
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
look uh if it went
 

609
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,110
look uh if it went
just a little bit further this wouldn't

610
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
just a little bit further this wouldn't
 

611
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,030
just a little bit further this wouldn't
have worked we have a one block

612
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
have worked we have a one block
 

613
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,550
have worked we have a one block
spacing here that allowed it to work

614
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
spacing here that allowed it to work
 

615
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,590
spacing here that allowed it to work
because it goes like this

616
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600

 

617
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,629

okay so that's how we're going to

618
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
okay so that's how we're going to
 

619
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,590
okay so that's how we're going to
connect down to the ground level

620
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
connect down to the ground level
 

621
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,949
connect down to the ground level
and may also make it go further out

622
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
and may also make it go further out
 

623
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,949
and may also make it go further out
this way and we'll have some more books

624
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
this way and we'll have some more books
 

625
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,110
this way and we'll have some more books
on the second floor

626
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
on the second floor
 

627
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,150
on the second floor
up over here

628
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160

 

629
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,550

three four five six seven

630
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
three four five six seven
 

631
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,910
three four five six seven
like over have another area up here

632
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
like over have another area up here
 

633
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,189
like over have another area up here
with books could be cool

634
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
with books could be cool
 

635
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,550
with books could be cool
that does look neat though i like how

636
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
that does look neat though i like how
 

637
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,389
that does look neat though i like how
that looks uh the walkway

638
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399

 

639
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,590

okay so let me finish this up

640
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
okay so let me finish this up
 

641
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,310
okay so let me finish this up
and we will do something else

642
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320

 

643
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,990

oh this guy snuck up on me

644
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
oh this guy snuck up on me
 

645
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,350
oh this guy snuck up on me
oh run away

646
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
oh run away
 

647
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,949
oh run away
nope nope oh went to the right

648
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
nope nope oh went to the right
 

649
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,710
nope nope oh went to the right
all right getting dangerous let's end it

650
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720

 

651
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,030

and there we go we got the staircase

652
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
and there we go we got the staircase
 

653
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,870
and there we go we got the staircase
mostly completed here

654
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
mostly completed here
 

655
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,110
mostly completed here
i put stairs on the back as well to make

656
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
i put stairs on the back as well to make
 

657
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,910
i put stairs on the back as well to make
it look

658
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
it look
 

659
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,990
it look
more structurally sound and

660
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
more structurally sound and
 

661
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,790
more structurally sound and
is it a t staircase or is it a y

662
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
is it a t staircase or is it a y
 

663
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,910
is it a t staircase or is it a y
staircase it looks like a y to me

664
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
staircase it looks like a y to me
 

665
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,150
staircase it looks like a y to me
from this angle i'm not sure if it has a

666
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
from this angle i'm not sure if it has a
 

667
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,189
from this angle i'm not sure if it has a
proper name

668
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
proper name
 

669
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,470
proper name
i think i think they're called t

670
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
i think i think they're called t
 

671
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,710
i think i think they're called t
staircases though

672
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
staircases though
 

673
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,790

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,590
talked about some
crazy safari

844
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
crazy safari
 

845
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,630
crazy safari
boat hunting game which never really

846
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
boat hunting game which never really
 

847
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,430
boat hunting game which never really
happened

848
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
happened
 

849
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,950
happened
uh we're doing something similar we're

850
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
uh we're doing something similar we're
 

851
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,230
uh we're doing something similar we're
going to do a boat target game

852
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240

 

853
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,830

i'm not sure how high i want to go

854
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
i'm not sure how high i want to go
 

855
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,669
i'm not sure how high i want to go
though with it this will try this

856
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
though with it this will try this
 

857
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,029
though with it this will try this
so yeah i had this idea today it's

858
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
so yeah i had this idea today it's
 

859
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,510
so yeah i had this idea today it's
actually

860
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
actually
 

861
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,070
actually
pretty simple i've seen like a lot of

862
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
pretty simple i've seen like a lot of
 

863
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,830
pretty simple i've seen like a lot of
people have done this idea before

864
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
people have done this idea before
 

865
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,029
people have done this idea before
where you have a bunch of falling

866
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
where you have a bunch of falling
 

867
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,669
where you have a bunch of falling
targets i've mostly seen people do it

868
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
targets i've mostly seen people do it
 

869
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:55,990
targets i've mostly seen people do it
with

870
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
with
 

871
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,590
with
chickens and i was considering using

872
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
chickens and i was considering using
 

873
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,029
chickens and i was considering using
chickens for it but

874
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
chickens for it but
 

875
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,270
chickens for it but
we're going to use boats instead just

876
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
we're going to use boats instead just
 

877
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,710
we're going to use boats instead just
because they're a little easier to

878
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
because they're a little easier to
 

879
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,070
because they're a little easier to
create

880
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
create
 

881
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,950
create
and manage

882
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
and manage
 

883
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,230
and manage
okay so we'll do this um

884
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
okay so we'll do this um
 

885
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,830
okay so we'll do this um
the idea is we're gonna put water over

886
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
the idea is we're gonna put water over
 

887
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,630
the idea is we're gonna put water over
top of this flowing this way

888
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
top of this flowing this way
 

889
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,190
top of this flowing this way
and we will have drop can i use dropper

890
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
and we will have drop can i use dropper
 

891
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,630
and we will have drop can i use dropper
i think i have to use dispensers

892
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
i think i have to use dispensers
 

893
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,029
i think i have to use dispensers
now that i think of it i do

894
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
now that i think of it i do
 

895
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,630
now that i think of it i do
be right back

896
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640

 

897
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,549

yeah so like i was saying we take our

898
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
yeah so like i was saying we take our
 

899
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,909
yeah so like i was saying we take our
dispensers

900
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
dispensers
 

901
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,029
dispensers
we're going to put them in the middle

902
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
we're going to put them in the middle
 

903
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,590
we're going to put them in the middle
here we're going to want at least

904
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
here we're going to want at least
 

905
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,150
here we're going to want at least
five of these five targets i believe

906
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
five of these five targets i believe
 

907
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,029
five of these five targets i believe
would be good

908
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
would be good
 

909
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,990
would be good
but we could do it as many as we want

910
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000

 

911
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,750

and this should be enough space in

912
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
and this should be enough space in
 

913
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,270
and this should be enough space in
between them

914
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280

 

915
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,909

okay so these are gonna be filled with

916
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919
okay so these are gonna be filled with
 

917
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,350
okay so these are gonna be filled with
boats

918
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
boats
 

919
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,310
boats
and we can even have a buffer of boats

920
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
and we can even have a buffer of boats
 

921
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,150
and we can even have a buffer of boats
uh in a chest and we'll bring

922
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
uh in a chest and we'll bring
 

923
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,830
uh in a chest and we'll bring
bring them to the dispensers using

924
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

925
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,230

hoppers

926
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
hoppers
 

927
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,149
hoppers
and okay um we got to put

928
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
and okay um we got to put
 

929
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,430
and okay um we got to put
a rim i'm just mostly as

930
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
a rim i'm just mostly as
 

931
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,630
a rim i'm just mostly as
i wanted to build the whole thing out of

932
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
i wanted to build the whole thing out of
 

933
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,350
i wanted to build the whole thing out of
dirt i'm just i'm out of dirt though

934
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
dirt i'm just i'm out of dirt though
 

935
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,549
dirt i'm just i'm out of dirt though
pretty much so we'll have

936
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
pretty much so we'll have
 

937
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,070
pretty much so we'll have
this around it for now i'm just doing

938
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
this around it for now i'm just doing
 

939
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,390
this around it for now i'm just doing
like a temp builds

940
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
like a temp builds
 

941
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,710
like a temp builds
just a shell to see if this works even

942
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
just a shell to see if this works even
 

943
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,310
just a shell to see if this works even
because i haven't tested it yet

944
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320

 

945
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,230

okay like that and then

946
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
okay like that and then
 

947
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,549
okay like that and then
boats are sort of two by two so we want

948
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
boats are sort of two by two so we want
 

949
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,190
boats are sort of two by two so we want
two block spacing

950
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200

 

951
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,909

all right so there's a two block gap

952
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
all right so there's a two block gap
 

953
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,270
all right so there's a two block gap
here where they should be able to fall

954
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
here where they should be able to fall
 

955
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,990
here where they should be able to fall
down

956
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
down
 

957
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,149
down
and we will put signs here to hold the

958
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
and we will put signs here to hold the
 

959
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,590
and we will put signs here to hold the
water in place that we're going to put

960
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
water in place that we're going to put
 

961
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,830
water in place that we're going to put
here

962
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840

 

963
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,110

although that's a bit wasteful i could

964
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
although that's a bit wasteful i could
 

965
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,029
although that's a bit wasteful i could
just do them let's let's run them this

966
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
just do them let's let's run them this
 

967
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,510
just do them let's let's run them this
way

968
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520

 

969
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,430

speaking of wasteful watch me drop signs

970
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
speaking of wasteful watch me drop signs
 

971
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,830
speaking of wasteful watch me drop signs
down there

972
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
down there
 

973
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,630
down there
okay so that'll go along

974
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
okay so that'll go along
 

975
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,350
okay so that'll go along
lots of signs oh my goodness did i bring

976
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
lots of signs oh my goodness did i bring
 

977
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,149
lots of signs oh my goodness did i bring
enough

978
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159

 

979
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,149

i did awesome i think i had another

980
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
i did awesome i think i had another
 

981
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,750
i did awesome i think i had another
stack

982
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
stack
 

983
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,070
stack
uh yeah so we'll get water going

984
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
uh yeah so we'll get water going
 

985
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,230
uh yeah so we'll get water going
all along here

986
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240

 

987
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,070

and the goal will be to shoot the boats

988
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
and the goal will be to shoot the boats
 

989
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,149
and the goal will be to shoot the boats
as they fall before they make it to

990
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
as they fall before they make it to
 

991
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,789
as they fall before they make it to
the ground if they make it to the ground

992
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
the ground if they make it to the ground
 

993
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,350
the ground if they make it to the ground
they'll go through some detection system

994
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
they'll go through some detection system
 

995
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,990
they'll go through some detection system
if it's still in boat form i i lose a

996
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
if it's still in boat form i i lose a
 

997
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,750
if it's still in boat form i i lose a
points if

998
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
points if
 

999
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,510
points if
if or i can have hoppers down there for

1000
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
if or i can have hoppers down there for
 

1001
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,950
if or i can have hoppers down there for
example that pick up the boat

1002
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
example that pick up the boat
 

1003
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,350
example that pick up the boat
and item form and then i'll gain points

1004
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
and item form and then i'll gain points
 

1005
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,149
and item form and then i'll gain points
from that

1006
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
from that
 

1007
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,430
from that
so it should be pretty simple to

1008
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
so it should be pretty simple to
 

1009
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,230
so it should be pretty simple to
distinguish between a drop boat and an

1010
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
distinguish between a drop boat and an
 

1011
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,909
distinguish between a drop boat and an
actual boat entity um

1012
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
actual boat entity um
 

1013
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,110
actual boat entity um
let's see let's get some boats

1014
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
let's see let's get some boats
 

1015
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,470
let's see let's get some boats
and then i'll use a randomizer for each

1016
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
and then i'll use a randomizer for each
 

1017
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,149
and then i'll use a randomizer for each
of these

1018
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
of these
 

1019
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,870
of these
which will release the boats and we can

1020
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
which will release the boats and we can
 

1021
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,990
which will release the boats and we can
then have a

1022
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
then have a
 

1023
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,029
then have a
a master timer

1024
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
a master timer
 

1025
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,630
a master timer
which we can adjust to make it more or

1026
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
which we can adjust to make it more or
 

1027
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,669
which we can adjust to make it more or
less difficult

1028
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679

 

1029
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,950

how can i power this let's uh

1030
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
how can i power this let's uh
 

1031
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,950
how can i power this let's uh
oh i don't even have cobble

1032
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960

 

1033
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,549

all right let's do a little bit of

1034
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
all right let's do a little bit of
 

1035
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,950
all right let's do a little bit of
mining

1036
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
mining
 

1037
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,510
mining
all these poor beautiful mountains

1038
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
all these poor beautiful mountains
 

1039
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,190
all these poor beautiful mountains
i just want to leave her

1040
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200

 

1041
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,230

okay let's go back

1042
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240

 

1043
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,669

should be able to make this look nice

1044
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
should be able to make this look nice
 

1045
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,830
should be able to make this look nice
too when it's done uh

1046
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
too when it's done uh
 

1047
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,430
too when it's done uh
it's gonna look pretty ugly at the start

1048
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
it's gonna look pretty ugly at the start
 

1049
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,630
it's gonna look pretty ugly at the start
here though

1050
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640

 

1051
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,669

okay that's

1052
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
okay that's
 

1053
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,870
okay that's
good this is just to test it so i put

1054
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
good this is just to test it so i put
 

1055
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,310
good this is just to test it so i put
the boat in there

1056
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
the boat in there
 

1057
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,230
the boat in there
see if it breaks oh it didn't break

1058
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
see if it breaks oh it didn't break
 

1059
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,230
see if it breaks oh it didn't break
until it hit the ground uh it didn't

1060
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
until it hit the ground uh it didn't
 

1061
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,350
until it hit the ground uh it didn't
even hit the wall here i thought it was

1062
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
even hit the wall here i thought it was
 

1063
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,669
even hit the wall here i thought it was
going to hit the wall

1064
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
going to hit the wall
 

1065
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,510
going to hit the wall
aha so we should actually try

1066
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,520
aha so we should actually try
 

1067
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,310
aha so we should actually try
two of these to see if they crash they

1068
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
two of these to see if they crash they
 

1069
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,909
two of these to see if they crash they
should be far enough apart but

1070
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
should be far enough apart but
 

1071
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,110
should be far enough apart but
just want to make sure

1072
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120

 

1073
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,950

you know what this game needs to do

1074
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
you know what this game needs to do
 

1075
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,789
you know what this game needs to do
finally make it so you can stack boats

1076
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
finally make it so you can stack boats
 

1077
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,549
finally make it so you can stack boats
i mean seriously you can stack

1078
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
i mean seriously you can stack
 

1079
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,070
i mean seriously you can stack
everything else at this point

1080
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
everything else at this point
 

1081
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:48,830
everything else at this point
why can't you stack boats

1082
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840

 

1083
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,510

okay

1084
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
okay
 

1085
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,630
okay
um let's kind of

1086
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
um let's kind of
 

1087
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,390
um let's kind of
do this the cheesy way and try to press

1088
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
do this the cheesy way and try to press
 

1089
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,190
do this the cheesy way and try to press
them quickly together

1090
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
them quickly together
 

1091
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,269
them quickly together
yeah that should be enough space between

1092
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
yeah that should be enough space between
 

1093
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,630
yeah that should be enough space between
them so

1094
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
them so
 

1095
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,070
them so
that should be pretty good i think

1096
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
that should be pretty good i think
 

1097
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,310
that should be pretty good i think
maybe we'll do one more boat and hop

1098
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
maybe we'll do one more boat and hop
 

1099
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,830
maybe we'll do one more boat and hop
down and see what it looks like as it

1100
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
down and see what it looks like as it
 

1101
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,390
down and see what it looks like as it
falls

1102
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
falls
 

1103
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,950
falls
this is where i need a second person to

1104
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
this is where i need a second person to
 

1105
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,909
this is where i need a second person to
do this for me

1106
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919

 

1107
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,669

that should be good i i almost think i

1108
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
that should be good i i almost think i
 

1109
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,110
that should be good i i almost think i
should have built it closer this way

1110
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
should have built it closer this way
 

1111
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,990
should have built it closer this way
though because it's going to hit the

1112
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
though because it's going to hit the
 

1113
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,470
though because it's going to hit the
hill now

1114
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
hill now
 

1115
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,070
hill now

the later game because when you're
 

1217
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,669
the later game because when you're
making a let's play you sort of play

making a let's play you sort of play
 

1219
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,430
making a let's play you sort of play
slower than you would if you were just

slower than you would if you were just
 

1221
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,070

on your own is the way they tend to go
 

1225
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,830
on your own is the way they tend to go
