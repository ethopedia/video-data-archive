00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,249
hello everybody welcome to another
episode of our let's play series and

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:13,259
episode of our let's play series and
 

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,350
episode of our let's play series and
today guys I thought we would have some

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
today guys I thought we would have some
 

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,410
today guys I thought we would have some
fun at the beginning here there's a

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
fun at the beginning here there's a
 

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,620
fun at the beginning here there's a
concept in this game that's fairly new

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,630
concept in this game that's fairly new
 

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,849
concept in this game that's fairly new
I'm sure a lot of you have seen it

12
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:22,859
I'm sure a lot of you have seen it
 

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm sure a lot of you have seen it
before though if you have Elijah wings

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,350
before though if you have Elijah wings
 

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,679
before though if you have Elijah wings
you can like jump and then activate the

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:27,689
you can like jump and then activate the
 

17
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,500
you can like jump and then activate the
wings before you hit the ground and then

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:30,510
wings before you hit the ground and then
 

19
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,139
wings before you hit the ground and then
you can do something like this where if

20
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:33,149
you can do something like this where if
 

21
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,520
you can do something like this where if
you have a one block I'd gap you can

22
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,530
you have a one block I'd gap you can
 

23
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,920
you have a one block I'd gap you can
actually like get stuck underneath it

24
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:36,930
actually like get stuck underneath it
 

25
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,369
actually like get stuck underneath it
and start crawling around I was playing

26
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:40,379
and start crawling around I was playing
 

27
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,080
and start crawling around I was playing
around with this today and it's actually

28
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,090
around with this today and it's actually
 

29
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,200
around with this today and it's actually
a lot of fun I'm gonna refer to it as

30
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,210
a lot of fun I'm gonna refer to it as
 

31
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,400
a lot of fun I'm gonna refer to it as
tunneling here I don't know if as a

32
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,410
tunneling here I don't know if as a
 

33
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,270
tunneling here I don't know if as a
fishel name but I start asking questions

34
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,280
fishel name but I start asking questions
 

35
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,490
fishel name but I start asking questions
like let's say you have a flat surface

36
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:52,500
like let's say you have a flat surface
 

37
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,260
like let's say you have a flat surface
like this is there some way of making

38
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,270
like this is there some way of making
 

39
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,630
like this is there some way of making
like a bunny hole to get down into a

40
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
like a bunny hole to get down into a
 

41
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,439
like a bunny hole to get down into a
tunnel and turns out there is and

42
00:00:59,439 --> 00:00:59,449
tunnel and turns out there is and
 

43
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,819
tunnel and turns out there is and
there's a lot of cool little tricks you

44
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:01,829
there's a lot of cool little tricks you
 

45
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,000
there's a lot of cool little tricks you
do with it it's a lot more of a flexible

46
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,010
do with it it's a lot more of a flexible
 

47
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,310
do with it it's a lot more of a flexible
thing than I realized

48
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
thing than I realized
 

49
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,990
thing than I realized
until today so for example let's say we

50
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
until today so for example let's say we
 

51
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,240
until today so for example let's say we
want to go underground and do something

52
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,250
want to go underground and do something
 

53
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,340
want to go underground and do something
like this and go into crawl mode and

54
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:15,350
like this and go into crawl mode and
 

55
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,929
like this and go into crawl mode and
let's say you want to get out well you

56
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:17,939
let's say you want to get out well you
 

57
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,520
let's say you want to get out well you
can't jump out of here right if you put

58
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,530
can't jump out of here right if you put
 

59
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,100
can't jump out of here right if you put
a slab down still can't get out if you

60
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,110
a slab down still can't get out if you
 

61
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,039
a slab down still can't get out if you
put two slabs down you can but you can't

62
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
put two slabs down you can but you can't
 

63
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,899
put two slabs down you can but you can't
actually fit between that little gap

64
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:26,909
actually fit between that little gap
 

65
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,859
actually fit between that little gap
there anymore so a cool thing to use is

66
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:30,869
there anymore so a cool thing to use is
 

67
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,410
there anymore so a cool thing to use is
snow slabs you can set them up so you

68
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,420
snow slabs you can set them up so you
 

69
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,810
snow slabs you can set them up so you
just barely get out of here like that

70
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:35,820
just barely get out of here like that
 

71
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,390
just barely get out of here like that
and then you can still fit between that

72
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
and then you can still fit between that
 

73
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,770
and then you can still fit between that
gap to get down which is cool and it

74
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
gap to get down which is cool and it
 

75
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,480
gap to get down which is cool and it
turns out I didn't realize this but you

76
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,490
turns out I didn't realize this but you
 

77
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,450
turns out I didn't realize this but you
can actually like play the game when

78
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,460
can actually like play the game when
 

79
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,800
can actually like play the game when
you're crawling around like this it's

80
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:48,810
you're crawling around like this it's
 

81
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,719
you're crawling around like this it's
it's really cool so you can expand your

82
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:50,729
it's really cool so you can expand your
 

83
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,270
it's really cool so you can expand your
tunnel as you go if you want okay tell

84
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
tunnel as you go if you want okay tell
 

85
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,340
tunnel as you go if you want okay tell
you what let's go try finding the zombie

86
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,350
you what let's go try finding the zombie
 

87
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,090
you what let's go try finding the zombie
for example you hear him let's go get

88
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,100
for example you hear him let's go get
 

89
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,249
for example you hear him let's go get
them so you can you can dig very easily

90
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:01,259
them so you can you can dig very easily
 

91
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,990
them so you can you can dig very easily
while you're while you're in this mode

92
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,000
while you're while you're in this mode
 

93
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,170
while you're while you're in this mode
it's no problem and you can build while

94
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
it's no problem and you can build while
 

95
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,869
it's no problem and you can build while
you're like this to basically do

96
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
you're like this to basically do
 

97
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,510
you're like this to basically do
something like that we can go keep going

98
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
something like that we can go keep going
 

99
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,670
something like that we can go keep going
here now you'll notice here if I try to

100
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
here now you'll notice here if I try to
 

101
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,589
here now you'll notice here if I try to
forward right now it doesn't let me it

102
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
forward right now it doesn't let me it
 

103
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,770
forward right now it doesn't let me it
actually look will bump me back if we

104
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:18,780
actually look will bump me back if we
 

105
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,569
actually look will bump me back if we
look in our camera view we're actually

106
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:20,579
look in our camera view we're actually
 

107
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,789
look in our camera view we're actually
standing up still we're not like

108
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:22,799
standing up still we're not like
 

109
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:25,309
standing up still we're not like
actually crawling so that one of the

110
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:25,319
actually crawling so that one of the
 

111
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,119
actually crawling so that one of the
rules to this is your head has to be in

112
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,129
rules to this is your head has to be in
 

113
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,369
rules to this is your head has to be in
like a non solid block in order to

114
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:31,379
like a non solid block in order to
 

115
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,020
like a non solid block in order to
continue if we try to go ahead here our

116
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,030
continue if we try to go ahead here our
 

117
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,819
continue if we try to go ahead here our
head is actually hitting the stone block

118
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:37,829
head is actually hitting the stone block
 

119
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,119
head is actually hitting the stone block
above here but we can put either a glass

120
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,129
above here but we can put either a glass
 

121
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,910
above here but we can put either a glass
block or a sea lantern or or something

122
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
block or a sea lantern or or something
 

123
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,990
block or a sea lantern or or something
there instead that's not to consider it

124
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
there instead that's not to consider it
 

125
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,740
there instead that's not to consider it
like a opaque block you know where is

126
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:51,750
like a opaque block you know where is
 

127
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,059
like a opaque block you know where is
this zombie I think keys I'll regain

128
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:56,069
this zombie I think keys I'll regain
 

129
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,159
this zombie I think keys I'll regain
closer we're getting closer actually we

130
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,169
closer we're getting closer actually we
 

131
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,809
closer we're getting closer actually we
don't even need to replace the stone

132
00:02:59,809 --> 00:02:59,819
don't even need to replace the stone
 

133
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,240
don't even need to replace the stone
here yeah it's it's pretty cool I would

134
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,250
here yeah it's it's pretty cool I would
 

135
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,789
here yeah it's it's pretty cool I would
be curious like you could play the whole

136
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:07,799
be curious like you could play the whole
 

137
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,580
be curious like you could play the whole
game this way if you wanted what kind of

138
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:10,590
game this way if you wanted what kind of
 

139
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,199
game this way if you wanted what kind of
base would you end up making if you did

140
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,209
base would you end up making if you did
 

141
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,539
base would you end up making if you did
that I bet you that'd be a pretty cool

142
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:14,549
that I bet you that'd be a pretty cool
 

143
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,599
that I bet you that'd be a pretty cool
challenge think we're getting closer oh

144
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:19,609
challenge think we're getting closer oh
 

145
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,140
challenge think we're getting closer oh
there he is we found him something I

146
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,150
there he is we found him something I
 

147
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,759
there he is we found him something I
played around with a lot today was the

148
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:25,769
played around with a lot today was the
 

149
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,240
played around with a lot today was the
staircase design um I tried to find one

150
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,250
staircase design um I tried to find one
 

151
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,009
staircase design um I tried to find one
that actually used stairs instead of

152
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,019
that actually used stairs instead of
 

153
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,599
that actually used stairs instead of
slabs but I couldn't find anything that

154
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:32,609
slabs but I couldn't find anything that
 

155
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,199
slabs but I couldn't find anything that
works

156
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,209
works
 

157
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,300
works
unfortunately let's look at a few more

158
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,310
unfortunately let's look at a few more
 

159
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,219
unfortunately let's look at a few more
rules to the tunneling here get a clear

160
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:40,229
rules to the tunneling here get a clear
 

161
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,899
rules to the tunneling here get a clear
idea of how it works so if you're

162
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:41,909
idea of how it works so if you're
 

163
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,530
idea of how it works so if you're
already tunneling and you enderpearl

164
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:44,540
already tunneling and you enderpearl
 

165
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,420
already tunneling and you enderpearl
you stay in a tunneling mode here you

166
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,430
you stay in a tunneling mode here you
 

167
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,649
you stay in a tunneling mode here you
don't you don't go out of it so that's

168
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:48,659
don't you don't go out of it so that's
 

169
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,449
don't you don't go out of it so that's
kind of cool also your player is 5/8 of

170
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:53,459
kind of cool also your player is 5/8 of
 

171
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,280
kind of cool also your player is 5/8 of
a block tall that's really important to

172
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,290
a block tall that's really important to
 

173
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,789
a block tall that's really important to
keep in mind with this so a slab is four

174
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
keep in mind with this so a slab is four
 

175
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,309
keep in mind with this so a slab is four
eights we're five eights so that means

176
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:01,319
eights we're five eights so that means
 

177
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,780
eights we're five eights so that means
we can't fit underneath this little

178
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:02,790
we can't fit underneath this little
 

179
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,399
we can't fit underneath this little
space here

180
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:04,409
space here
 

181
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,149
space here
there's only a few blocks in the game

182
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
there's only a few blocks in the game
 

183
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,599
there's only a few blocks in the game
that actually go to this point 375 if

184
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:11,609
that actually go to this point 375 if
 

185
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,270
that actually go to this point 375 if
you look at our y-coordinate daylight

186
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
you look at our y-coordinate daylight
 

187
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,999
you look at our y-coordinate daylight
sensors are one of them and that allows

188
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:17,009
sensors are one of them and that allows
 

189
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,680
sensors are one of them and that allows
you to fit underneath here so this is

190
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:18,690
you to fit underneath here so this is
 

191
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,319
you to fit underneath here so this is
five-eighths tall where we're at right

192
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:21,329
five-eighths tall where we're at right
 

193
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,450
five-eighths tall where we're at right
now that's the tightest spacing you can

194
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,460
now that's the tightest spacing you can
 

195
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,269
now that's the tightest spacing you can
get so you can do that with snow slabs

196
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:26,279
get so you can do that with snow slabs
 

197
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,650
get so you can do that with snow slabs
you can do it with daylight sensors and

198
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:27,660
you can do it with daylight sensors and
 

199
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,430
you can do it with daylight sensors and
another one is flowerpots oh darn it we

200
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,440
another one is flowerpots oh darn it we
 

201
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,380
another one is flowerpots oh darn it we
went out a tunneling mode to get back

202
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:36,390
went out a tunneling mode to get back
 

203
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,620
went out a tunneling mode to get back
into it can be a little bit tricky oh

204
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:41,630

 

205
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,570

there we go we're fine usually you have

206
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,580
there we go we're fine usually you have
 

207
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,370
there we go we're fine usually you have
to break the blocks above you to do it

208
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,380
to break the blocks above you to do it
 

209
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,290
to break the blocks above you to do it
yeah these are also points 375 oh we're

210
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,300
yeah these are also points 375 oh we're
 

211
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,920
yeah these are also points 375 oh we're
in danger

212
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:51,930
in danger
 

213
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,170
in danger
quick to the bunny hole all right I

214
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,180
quick to the bunny hole all right I
 

215
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,180
quick to the bunny hole all right I
installed the door to our place here

216
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,190
installed the door to our place here
 

217
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,510
installed the door to our place here
pretty fancy right two-way door very

218
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
pretty fancy right two-way door very
 

219
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,410
pretty fancy right two-way door very
simple uh-huh I've got some chests in

220
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:06,420
simple uh-huh I've got some chests in
 

221
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,500
simple uh-huh I've got some chests in
here just goofing around with a few

222
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,510
here just goofing around with a few
 

223
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,490
here just goofing around with a few
things here

224
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,500
things here
 

225
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,050
things here
so another thing to keep in mind about

226
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,060
so another thing to keep in mind about
 

227
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,030
so another thing to keep in mind about
tunneling here is you can you can jump

228
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,040
tunneling here is you can you can jump
 

229
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,490
tunneling here is you can you can jump
when you're like this so for example you

230
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
when you're like this so for example you
 

231
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,050
when you're like this so for example you
could go underneath here or you choose

232
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,060
could go underneath here or you choose
 

233
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,500
could go underneath here or you choose
to jump to the second layer like so and

234
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,510
to jump to the second layer like so and
 

235
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,110
to jump to the second layer like so and
like a normal minecraft you can only

236
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,120
like a normal minecraft you can only
 

237
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,200
like a normal minecraft you can only
walk up half a slab or four eighths of a

238
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,210
walk up half a slab or four eighths of a
 

239
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,210
walk up half a slab or four eighths of a
block at a time so you can do like stair

240
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,220
block at a time so you can do like stair
 

241
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,610
block at a time so you can do like stair
chases where you walk up like that for

242
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,620
chases where you walk up like that for
 

243
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,000
chases where you walk up like that for
example

244
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,010

 

245
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,560

yeah just lots of lots of really weird

246
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,570
yeah just lots of lots of really weird
 

247
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,880
yeah just lots of lots of really weird
things one of the things I haven't tried

248
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:37,890
things one of the things I haven't tried
 

249
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,130
things one of the things I haven't tried
yet I wanted to do with you guys is what

250
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,140
yet I wanted to do with you guys is what
 

251
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,530
yet I wanted to do with you guys is what
happens if you set up minecart tracks

252
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:42,540
happens if you set up minecart tracks
 

253
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,860
happens if you set up minecart tracks
here can you like go in them and still

254
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:45,870
here can you like go in them and still
 

255
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,220
here can you like go in them and still
see I'm not sure oh okay I didn't expect

256
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,230
see I'm not sure oh okay I didn't expect
 

257
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,900
see I'm not sure oh okay I didn't expect
that we're even lower to the ground now

258
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:53,910
that we're even lower to the ground now
 

259
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,270
that we're even lower to the ground now
we're right at the rails all right now

260
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
we're right at the rails all right now
 

261
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,470
we're right at the rails all right now
if we leave are we gonna stay in

262
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,480
if we leave are we gonna stay in
 

263
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,490
if we leave are we gonna stay in
tunneling mode oh you fall through

264
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,500
tunneling mode oh you fall through
 

265
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,670
tunneling mode oh you fall through
blocks okay cool but anyways here is the

266
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,680
blocks okay cool but anyways here is the
 

267
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,990
blocks okay cool but anyways here is the
main thing I wanted to show you guys

268
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
main thing I wanted to show you guys
 

269
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,820
main thing I wanted to show you guys
with the tunneling so I set up a little

270
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:13,830
with the tunneling so I set up a little
 

271
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,970
with the tunneling so I set up a little
little tunnel over here and go sneak

272
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:16,980
little tunnel over here and go sneak
 

273
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,790
little tunnel over here and go sneak
inside the hole the whole reason I was

274
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:19,800
inside the hole the whole reason I was
 

275
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,440
inside the hole the whole reason I was
playing around with this today is like

276
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,450
playing around with this today is like
 

277
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,630
playing around with this today is like
man I wonder if you could do the ice

278
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:23,640
man I wonder if you could do the ice
 

279
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,300
man I wonder if you could do the ice
speed boost somehow and it turns out you

280
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,310
speed boost somehow and it turns out you
 

281
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,640
speed boost somehow and it turns out you
can you can do the speed boost failure

282
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,650
can you can do the speed boost failure
 

283
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,770
can you can do the speed boost failure
while you're tunneling here kind of cool

284
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:32,780
while you're tunneling here kind of cool
 

285
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,570
while you're tunneling here kind of cool
so I put a tunnel from from over there

286
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:35,580
so I put a tunnel from from over there
 

287
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,020
so I put a tunnel from from over there
to the village a little fast faster

288
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,030
to the village a little fast faster
 

289
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,980
to the village a little fast faster
method of getting here Oh

290
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:40,990
method of getting here Oh
 

291
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,450
method of getting here Oh
might have to change out a little bit

292
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,460
might have to change out a little bit
 

293
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,970
might have to change out a little bit
and I use flowerpots just because I

294
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:44,980
and I use flowerpots just because I
 

295
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,530
and I use flowerpots just because I
don't want the redstone activating with

296
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:46,540
don't want the redstone activating with
 

297
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,480
don't want the redstone activating with
the daylight sensors I'm not sure which

298
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,490
the daylight sensors I'm not sure which
 

299
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,730
the daylight sensors I'm not sure which
one's more leggy than then each other

300
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:50,740
one's more leggy than then each other
 

301
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,060
one's more leggy than then each other
though oh yeah and before I forget guys

302
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,070
though oh yeah and before I forget guys
 

303
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,220
though oh yeah and before I forget guys

I think that might have been the best

310
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,100
I think that might have been the best
 

311
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,640
I think that might have been the best

actually it got like just about 6,000

314
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,610
actually it got like just about 6,000
 

315

actually it got like just about 6,000
comments and what was it I think about

316
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,570
comments and what was it I think about
 

317
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,020
comments and what was it I think about
18,000 likes but if I remember right so

because Anderman were stealing the sand
 

407
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,010
because Anderman were stealing the sand
blocks and every now and then we would

408
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,020
blocks and every now and then we would
 

409
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,280
blocks and every now and then we would
lose another replant like the soil was

410
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,290
lose another replant like the soil was

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:08,830
took it away so now we have a proper
 

415
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,130
took it away so now we have a proper
fence going around it and it should

416
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,140
fence going around it and it should
 

417
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,050
fence going around it and it should
protect the reeds I think that's pretty

418

over there might look nice we should
 

429
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,420
over there might look nice we should
probably put a path through here would

430
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,430

them around the world honestly I haven't
 

479
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,620
them around the world honestly I haven't
used this too much maybe two or three

480
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,630
used this too much maybe two or three
 

481
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,980
used this too much maybe two or three
times but it was a cool build it

482
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:31,990
times but it was a cool build it
 

483
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,030
times but it was a cool build it
nonetheless so the change in 1.11 is

484
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
nonetheless so the change in 1.11 is
 

485
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,100
nonetheless so the change in 1.11 is
zombie villagers no longer spawn from

zombie villagers no longer spawn from
 

487
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,790
zombie villagers no longer spawn from
zombie spawners which kind of sucks so

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,290
this is officially broken cannot be
 

491
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,940
this is officially broken cannot be
fixed and likewise this little build

492
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:47,950
fixed and likewise this little build
 

493
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,100
fixed and likewise this little build
over here is also broken unfortunately

494
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,110
over here is also broken unfortunately

not a big deal though I don't use this

496
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,600
not a big deal though I don't use this
 

497
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,069
not a big deal though I don't use this
too often probably maybe five times or

five times then I use this to spawn into
the zombie villager cure it and then

high and that's why we have a bunch of
 

589

605
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,340
was something I started way back in 1.8
and then it broke in 1.9 just after I

606
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,350
and then it broke in 1.9 just after I
 

607
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,960
and then it broke in 1.9 just after I
got like the start of the stun and I

608
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:56,970
got like the start of the stun and I
 

609
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,269
got like the start of the stun and I
haven't fixed it since and today on a

whim is like I wonder if I can get this
 

613
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,889
whim is like I wonder if I can get this
working again in 1.11 and sure enough

614
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:03,899
working again in 1.11 and sure enough
 

615
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,889
working again in 1.11 and sure enough
got it going here basically a bunch of

616
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:06,899
got it going here basically a bunch of
 

617
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,689
got it going here basically a bunch of
command block stuff changed from one

618
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:08,699
command block stuff changed from one
 

619
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,249
command block stuff changed from one
point eight to one point nine which is

620
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:10,259
point eight to one point nine which is
 

621
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,819
point eight to one point nine which is
why it broke but it's definitely fixable

622
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:13,829
why it broke but it's definitely fixable
 

623
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,379
why it broke but it's definitely fixable
I just kind of got distracted from it

I just kind of got distracted from it
 

625
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,509
I just kind of got distracted from it
and this was supposed to be like a

626
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
and this was supposed to be like a
 

627
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,929
and this was supposed to be like a
cannon run video basically after that

628
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:20,939
cannon run video basically after that
 

629
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,360

see I haven't built any more to this so

634
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
see I haven't built any more to this so
 

635
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,290
see I haven't built any more to this so
that's like a little teaser intro to it

that's like a little teaser intro to it
 

637
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,850
that's like a little teaser intro to it
and maybe who knows one day I'll

638
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:31,860
and maybe who knows one day I'll
 

639
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,069
and maybe who knows one day I'll
actually finish it but if not at least

640
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
actually finish it but if not at least
 

641
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,759
actually finish it but if not at least
you saw the start of it alright guys so

642
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:37,769
you saw the start of it alright guys so
 

643
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,980
you saw the start of it alright guys so
we are back to reality here back in our

644
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:39,990
we are back to reality here back in our
 

645
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,139
we are back to reality here back in our
let's play world this is a few hours

646
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:42,149
let's play world this is a few hours
 

647
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,470
let's play world this is a few hours
later now and this has been a bit brutal

648
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,480
later now and this has been a bit brutal
 

649
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,900
later now and this has been a bit brutal
this whole redesigning and rebuilding

650
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:47,910
this whole redesigning and rebuilding
 

651
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,119
this whole redesigning and rebuilding
thing so I'm starting to tear it down

652
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,129
thing so I'm starting to tear it down
 

653
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:50,780
thing so I'm starting to tear it down
now

654
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:50,790
now
 

655
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,269
now
I I designed each of the aspects in a

656
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
I I designed each of the aspects in a
 

657
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,999
I I designed each of the aspects in a
creative world here and now I'm starting

658
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,009
creative world here and now I'm starting
 

659
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,319
creative world here and now I'm starting
to piece it back together and hopefully

660
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:57,329
to piece it back together and hopefully
 

661
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,569
to piece it back together and hopefully
it all works like I like I want it to

662
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:01,579
it all works like I like I want it to
 

663
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,009
it all works like I like I want it to
but as anybody's guess whether or not

664
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:04,019
but as anybody's guess whether or not
 

665
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,090
but as anybody's guess whether or not
this is actually going to work when

666
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,100
this is actually going to work when
 

667
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,840
this is actually going to work when
we're all done here

668
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:05,850
we're all done here
 

669
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,850
we're all done here
it seemed seemed good though and

670
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:07,860
it seemed seemed good though and
 

671
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,829
it seemed seemed good though and
creative okay so let's maybe hope that's

672
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
creative okay so let's maybe hope that's
 

673
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,679
creative okay so let's maybe hope that's
not where that goes let's try to build a

674
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:15,689
not where that goes let's try to build a
 

675
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,929
not where that goes let's try to build a
little bit of this together give you an

676
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:17,939
little bit of this together give you an
 

677
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,150
little bit of this together give you an
idea of how it works so what we're gonna

678
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
idea of how it works so what we're gonna
 

679
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,740
idea of how it works so what we're gonna
do is two sticky pistons here in here

680
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:23,750
do is two sticky pistons here in here
 

681
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,079
do is two sticky pistons here in here
bottom one's going to be a slime block

682
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,089
bottom one's going to be a slime block
 

683
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,400
bottom one's going to be a slime block
top one is going to be a glass block so

684
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,410
top one is going to be a glass block so
 

685
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,379
top one is going to be a glass block so
this is going to be extended most of the

686
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:30,389
this is going to be extended most of the
 

687
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,790
this is going to be extended most of the
time and the zombie pigmen will fall

688
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
time and the zombie pigmen will fall
 

689
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,759
time and the zombie pigmen will fall
down on top of this glass block and take

690
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:34,769
down on top of this glass block and take
 

691
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,860
down on top of this glass block and take
damage enough to kill them hopefully and

692
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:36,870
damage enough to kill them hopefully and
 

693
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,720
damage enough to kill them hopefully and
then every so often this is going to

694
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,730
then every so often this is going to
 

695
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,799
then every so often this is going to
retract and then extend to have the

696
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:42,809
retract and then extend to have the
 

697
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,689
retract and then extend to have the
slime block pushes stuff down the icier

698
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:44,699
slime block pushes stuff down the icier
 

699
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,720
slime block pushes stuff down the icier
right to the middle alright that's kind

700
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:47,730
right to the middle alright that's kind
 

701
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,049
right to the middle alright that's kind
of the general plan to this and now what

702
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:51,059
of the general plan to this and now what
 

703
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,970
of the general plan to this and now what
do we want to do let's grab some string

704
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:52,980
do we want to do let's grab some string
 

705
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,370
do we want to do let's grab some string
here

706
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:55,380

 

707
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,530

now two blocks above this I'm going to

708
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:58,540
now two blocks above this I'm going to
 

709
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,310
now two blocks above this I'm going to
put a piece of string there and I think

710
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,320
put a piece of string there and I think
 

711
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,050
put a piece of string there and I think
an observer block over here is what I

712
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,060
an observer block over here is what I
 

713
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,350
an observer block over here is what I
did I'm doing this similar to what Snow

714
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
did I'm doing this similar to what Snow
 

715
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
did I'm doing this similar to what Snow
Crash did in his gold farm he kind of

716
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,130
Crash did in his gold farm he kind of
 

717
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,500
Crash did in his gold farm he kind of
has like the best gold form at the

718
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,510
has like the best gold form at the
 

719
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,970
has like the best gold form at the
moment if you're looking for a tutorial

720
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
moment if you're looking for a tutorial
 

721
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,650

originally I tried to vary mine by using

722
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:16,660
originally I tried to vary mine by using
 

723
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,900
originally I tried to vary mine by using
the piston translocator trick but that's

724
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:18,910
the piston translocator trick but that's
 

725
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,180
the piston translocator trick but that's
gone now so I kind of have to do what he

726
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,190
gone now so I kind of have to do what he
 

727
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,980
gone now so I kind of have to do what he
did because there's no other real way of

728
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:22,990
did because there's no other real way of
 

729
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,400
did because there's no other real way of
moving XP except like with cauldrons or

730
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,410
moving XP except like with cauldrons or
 

731
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,760
moving XP except like with cauldrons or
something stupid so that's a little bit

732
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:29,770
something stupid so that's a little bit
 

733
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,030
something stupid so that's a little bit
too crazy for me

734
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
too crazy for me
 

735
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,160
too crazy for me
so we're sliding it across ice is the

736
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,170
so we're sliding it across ice is the
 

737
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,400
so we're sliding it across ice is the
plan which seems to work pretty good so

738
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,410
plan which seems to work pretty good so
 

739
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,440
plan which seems to work pretty good so
I just built a hopper clock here so the

740
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,450
I just built a hopper clock here so the
 

741
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,910
I just built a hopper clock here so the
observer goes right into the hopper

742
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
observer goes right into the hopper
 

743
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,560
observer goes right into the hopper
clock and this is what's going to

744
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,570
clock and this is what's going to
 

745
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,050
clock and this is what's going to
control how often it shoots the items in

746
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,060
control how often it shoots the items in
 

747
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,260
control how often it shoots the items in
the XP across the ice and just in my

748
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,270
the XP across the ice and just in my
 

749
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,090
the XP across the ice and just in my
testing it seemed like 16 was a good

750
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,100
testing it seemed like 16 was a good
 

751
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,130
testing it seemed like 16 was a good
number here we'll try that out but we'll

752
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,140
number here we'll try that out but we'll
 

753
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,360
number here we'll try that out but we'll
be able to control it later if we want

754
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,370
be able to control it later if we want
 

755
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,730
be able to control it later if we want
and now we want to go down building this

756
00:16:59,730 --> 00:16:59,740
and now we want to go down building this
 

757
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,470
and now we want to go down building this
is going to be tough though because we

758
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:01,480
is going to be tough though because we
 

759
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,740
is going to be tough though because we
can't fly all right where do we want to

760
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:04,750
can't fly all right where do we want to
 

761
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,610
can't fly all right where do we want to
go I think we want to go over here yes

762
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,620
go I think we want to go over here yes
 

763
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,620
go I think we want to go over here yes
can we get down a little bit more okay

764
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:10,630
can we get down a little bit more okay
 

765
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,760
can we get down a little bit more okay
I'm just going to put a little bit of a

766
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:11,770
I'm just going to put a little bit of a
 

767
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm just going to put a little bit of a
floor down for now also we can't have a

768
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,530
floor down for now also we can't have a
 

769
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,800
floor down for now also we can't have a
block under the slime there otherwise it

770
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:16,810
block under the slime there otherwise it
 

771
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,439
block under the slime there otherwise it
won't be able to move all right so from

772
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:19,449
won't be able to move all right so from
 

773
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,480
won't be able to move all right so from
that then we are going to grab the

774
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,490
that then we are going to grab the
 

775
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,750
that then we are going to grab the
signal over here so from that then we

776
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:24,760
signal over here so from that then we
 

777
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
signal over here so from that then we
want to use a sticky piston will do a

778
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:26,770
want to use a sticky piston will do a
 

779
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,820
want to use a sticky piston will do a
monostable circuits that'll go into

780
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:29,830
monostable circuits that'll go into
 

781
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,390
monostable circuits that'll go into
there and then go over like this

782
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
there and then go over like this
 

783
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,120
there and then go over like this
redstone repeater set it for all right

784
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,130
redstone repeater set it for all right
 

785
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,680
redstone repeater set it for all right
so this whole hopper timer thing here it

786
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:37,690
so this whole hopper timer thing here it
 

787
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,660
so this whole hopper timer thing here it
controls how frequently the slime block

788
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:39,670
controls how frequently the slime block
 

789
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,000
controls how frequently the slime block
shoots the items across the ice but we

790
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,010
shoots the items across the ice but we
 

791
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,760
shoots the items across the ice but we
also have to control how how long the

792
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:44,770
also have to control how how long the
 

793
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,800
also have to control how how long the
Pistons are tracked for and then before

794
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:46,810
Pistons are tracked for and then before
 

795
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,050
Pistons are tracked for and then before
they extend again we it needs to be long

796
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,060
they extend again we it needs to be long
 

797
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,960
they extend again we it needs to be long
enough that items can fall down and land

798
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:51,970
enough that items can fall down and land
 

799
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,030
enough that items can fall down and land
on the note block there if it's too

800
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,040
on the note block there if it's too
 

801
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
on the note block there if it's too
short of timing it's just going to like

802
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,570
short of timing it's just going to like
 

803
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,360
short of timing it's just going to like
bump them with a glass block or

804
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,370
bump them with a glass block or
 

805
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,770
bump them with a glass block or
something and if it's too long then

806
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:58,780
something and if it's too long then
 

807
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,480
something and if it's too long then
zombie pigmen will fall down on the note

808
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,490
zombie pigmen will fall down on the note
 

809
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,460
zombie pigmen will fall down on the note
block and their drops are going to splat

810
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:02,470
block and their drops are going to splat
 

811
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,110
block and their drops are going to splat
all over the place so we want it to be

812
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,120
all over the place so we want it to be
 

813
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,680
all over the place so we want it to be
just perfect and from

814
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:07,690
just perfect and from
 

815
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,320
just perfect and from
let's see from where we left off there

816
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,330
let's see from where we left off there
 

817
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,490
let's see from where we left off there
we're going to branch down here

818
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,500
we're going to branch down here
 

819
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,460
we're going to branch down here
okay repeater set this one at four this

820
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,470
okay repeater set this one at four this
 

821
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,820
okay repeater set this one at four this
one at one block over here repeater set

822
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:20,830
one at one block over here repeater set
 

823
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,160
one at one block over here repeater set
at one and we got to get two Pistons

824
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,170
at one and we got to get two Pistons
 

825
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,400
at one and we got to get two Pistons
here for some reason slime blocks are

826
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,410
here for some reason slime blocks are
 

827
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,080
here for some reason slime blocks are
acting really weird with sticky pistons

828
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,090
acting really weird with sticky pistons
 

829
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,810
acting really weird with sticky pistons
you kind of have to activate them with

830
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:33,820
you kind of have to activate them with
 

831
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,790
you kind of have to activate them with
redstone dust if you'd use a repeater it

832
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:35,800
redstone dust if you'd use a repeater it
 

833
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,680
redstone dust if you'd use a repeater it
leaves the slime block behind it's

834
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:37,690
leaves the slime block behind it's
 

835
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,610
leaves the slime block behind it's
really weird with this update okay we

836
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:41,620
really weird with this update okay we
 

837
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,310
really weird with this update okay we
got to get a torch here so yeah by

838
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
got to get a torch here so yeah by
 

839
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,810
got to get a torch here so yeah by
default these are going to be extended

840
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:45,820
default these are going to be extended
 

841
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,560
default these are going to be extended
so we'll do that so if this if this

842
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:49,570
so we'll do that so if this if this
 

843
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,230
so we'll do that so if this if this
redstone dust wasn't down there I think

844
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
redstone dust wasn't down there I think
 

845
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,370
redstone dust wasn't down there I think
it's going to leave the slime block

846
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:53,380
it's going to leave the slime block
 

847
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,870
it's going to leave the slime block
behind yeah very weird that's something

848
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
behind yeah very weird that's something
 

849
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,170
behind yeah very weird that's something
new I've never seen that before so we

850
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,180
new I've never seen that before so we
 

851
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,970
new I've never seen that before so we
got to keep a piece of dust down here I

852
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:02,980
got to keep a piece of dust down here I
 

853
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,600
got to keep a piece of dust down here I
guess alright so then what do we do here

854
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:06,610
guess alright so then what do we do here
 

855
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,680
guess alright so then what do we do here
good question good question I think we

856
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,690
good question good question I think we
 

857
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,860
good question good question I think we
go up like this and then in like that

858
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:13,870
go up like this and then in like that
 

859
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,460
go up like this and then in like that
all right

860
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,470
all right
 

861
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,590
all right
so yeah this extends a signal to be a

862
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:16,600
so yeah this extends a signal to be a
 

863
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,050
so yeah this extends a signal to be a
little bit longer so that these are

864
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,060
little bit longer so that these are
 

865
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,320
little bit longer so that these are
tracked just the right amount of time

866
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,330
tracked just the right amount of time
 

867
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,480
tracked just the right amount of time
get rid of that get rid of that's and

868
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,490
get rid of that get rid of that's and
 

869
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,190
get rid of that get rid of that's and
that and I think we are good alright

870
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,200
that and I think we are good alright
 

871
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,900
that and I think we are good alright
finally just the prevent zombie pigman

872
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:30,910
finally just the prevent zombie pigman
 

873
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,160
finally just the prevent zombie pigman
from spawning I'm going to cover this

874
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,170
from spawning I'm going to cover this
 

875
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:39,150
from spawning I'm going to cover this
over with glass oh man I'm getting

876
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,160
over with glass oh man I'm getting
 

877
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,630
over with glass oh man I'm getting
really tired here that huge projects a

878
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
really tired here that huge projects a
 

879
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,030
really tired here that huge projects a
huge renovation but we're getting close

880
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,040
huge renovation but we're getting close
 

881
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,130
huge renovation but we're getting close
to done got the four sides all complete

882
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,140
to done got the four sides all complete
 

883
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,200
to done got the four sides all complete
and it's really cool like they're all

884
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,210
and it's really cool like they're all
 

885
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,240
and it's really cool like they're all
self-contained right so there's no clock

886
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,250
self-contained right so there's no clock
 

887
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,940
self-contained right so there's no clock
that runs it only runs if zombie pigman

888
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:53,950
that runs it only runs if zombie pigman
 

889
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,530
that runs it only runs if zombie pigman
are falling down that chamber there and

890
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:55,540
are falling down that chamber there and
 

891
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,020
are falling down that chamber there and
it shoots items to the middle and now I

892
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,030
it shoots items to the middle and now I
 

893
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,550
it shoots items to the middle and now I
got like the middle part done here

894
00:19:59,550 --> 00:19:59,560
got like the middle part done here
 

895
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,890
got like the middle part done here
you've got a cool wrapping of hoppers

896
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:01,900
you've got a cool wrapping of hoppers
 

897
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,440
you've got a cool wrapping of hoppers
around around the middle section you can

898
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,450
around around the middle section you can
 

899
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,960
around around the middle section you can
see right there like on all four sides

900
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:06,970
see right there like on all four sides
 

901
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,120
see right there like on all four sides
there is a hopper minecart that's really

902
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,130
there is a hopper minecart that's really
 

903
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,360
there is a hopper minecart that's really
important so as like the gold and the

904
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,370
important so as like the gold and the
 

905
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,400
important so as like the gold and the
zombie flesh goes across the ice here as

906
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,410
zombie flesh goes across the ice here as
 

907
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,380
zombie flesh goes across the ice here as
it passes over top that block thought

908
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,390
it passes over top that block thought
 

909
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,480
it passes over top that block thought
the hopper minecart is going to pull the

910
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,490
the hopper minecart is going to pull the
 

911
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,460
the hopper minecart is going to pull the
items down and go into these hoppers

912
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,470
items down and go into these hoppers
 

913
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,580
items down and go into these hoppers
it's just here now unfortunately I was

914
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,590
it's just here now unfortunately I was
 

915
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,320
it's just here now unfortunately I was
really hoping this would line up with

916
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,330
really hoping this would line up with
 

917
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,600
really hoping this would line up with
what we built here already but we are

918
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:28,610
what we built here already but we are
 

919
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,210
what we built here already but we are
like five blocks lower already so this

920
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,220
like five blocks lower already so this
 

921
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,759
like five blocks lower already so this
all has to be moved down if we want to

922
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:33,769
all has to be moved down if we want to
 

923
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,990
all has to be moved down if we want to
keep it because we don't have the item

924
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,000
keep it because we don't have the item
 

925
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,490
keep it because we don't have the item
filter set up yet that's going to take

926
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:36,500
filter set up yet that's going to take
 

927
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,119
filter set up yet that's going to take
up even more space here all right let's

928
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,129
up even more space here all right let's
 

929
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,190
up even more space here all right let's
go up here and we should be able to test

930
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,200
go up here and we should be able to test
 

931
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,619
go up here and we should be able to test
the seller already I think we should

932
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:44,629
the seller already I think we should
 

933
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:46,119
the seller already I think we should
test it out I got to make sure this

934
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,129
test it out I got to make sure this
 

935
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,570
test it out I got to make sure this
works before we continue ahh so here's

936
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:49,580
works before we continue ahh so here's
 

937
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,460
works before we continue ahh so here's
here's kind of the weird thing as items

938
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:51,470
here's kind of the weird thing as items
 

939
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,060
here's kind of the weird thing as items
slide over here we got trip wires on all

940
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,070
slide over here we got trip wires on all
 

941
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,369
slide over here we got trip wires on all
four sides so if we go down here yeah so

942
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:00,379
four sides so if we go down here yeah so
 

943
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:04,720
four sides so if we go down here yeah so
as items pass by they do that it gives

944
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:04,730
as items pass by they do that it gives
 

945
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,490
as items pass by they do that it gives
it enough time for them to settle in the

946
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:06,500
it enough time for them to settle in the
 

947
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,080
it enough time for them to settle in the
slime block in the middle there so

948
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,090
slime block in the middle there so
 

949
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,389
slime block in the middle there so
they're not moving when it flings them

950
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:10,399
they're not moving when it flings them
 

951
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:15,850
they're not moving when it flings them
