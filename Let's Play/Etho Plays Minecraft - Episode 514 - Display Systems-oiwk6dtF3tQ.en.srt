113
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,970
so this was one idea this is just a
mock-up I did where we could like drop

114
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:28,980
mock-up I did where we could like drop
 

115
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,580
mock-up I did where we could like drop
down concrete powder or sand or

we've we've gotten in the game problem
 

121
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,619
we've we've gotten in the game problem
with doing that is it's very difficult

122
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:39,629
with doing that is it's very difficult
 

123
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,550

it's a glow stone wall idea but we're
 

163
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,559
it's a glow stone wall idea but we're
gonna break it up a bit somebody pointed

164
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:39,569
gonna break it up a bit somebody pointed
 

165
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,939
gonna break it up a bit somebody pointed
out see finger and show this what we can

166
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:43,949
out see finger and show this what we can
 

167
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,949
out see finger and show this what we can
do is like insert items into a hopper

168
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:45,959
do is like insert items into a hopper
 

169
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,309
do is like insert items into a hopper
here and that'll make the glowstone

170
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,319
here and that'll make the glowstone
 

171
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,280
here and that'll make the glowstone
light up here and then when we when we

172
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,290
light up here and then when we when we
 

173
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,960
light up here and then when we when we
need to move it instead of like pushing

174
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:53,970
need to move it instead of like pushing
 

175
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,369
need to move it instead of like pushing
it with pistons like we were gonna do

176
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:55,379
it with pistons like we were gonna do
 

177
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,879
it with pistons like we were gonna do
there we will just unpowered repower

178
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:58,889
there we will just unpowered repower
 

179
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,319
there we will just unpowered repower
this quickly and you see it'll move

180
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,329
this quickly and you see it'll move
 

181
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,050
this quickly and you see it'll move
forward one space then we can insert the

182
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,060
forward one space then we can insert the
 

183
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,280
forward one space then we can insert the
next bit here and move it along and that

184
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,290
next bit here and move it along and that
 

185
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,610
next bit here and move it along and that
way we have moveable data right that's

186
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,620
way we have moveable data right that's
 

187
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,080
way we have moveable data right that's
easy to control by instead of like doing

188
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,090
easy to control by instead of like doing
 

189
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,360
easy to control by instead of like doing
a big wall of glowstone like for tall

190
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,370
a big wall of glowstone like for tall
 

191
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,279
a big wall of glowstone like for tall
here I'll stack together we're gonna

192
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,289
here I'll stack together we're gonna
 

193
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,110
here I'll stack together we're gonna
leave a one block space between each of

194
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
leave a one block space between each of
 

195
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,700
leave a one block space between each of
them because it's gonna be so much

196
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:22,710
them because it's gonna be so much
 

197
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,980
them because it's gonna be so much
easier to do that and that is gonna look

198
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:24,990
easier to do that and that is gonna look
 

199
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,080
easier to do that and that is gonna look
a little something like this so check it

200
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,090
a little something like this so check it
 

201
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,220
a little something like this so check it
out

202
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,230
out
 

203
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,920
out
guys I think overall this looks quite a

204
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:29,930
guys I think overall this looks quite a
 

205
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,630
guys I think overall this looks quite a
bit better than the orange end and

206
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:31,640
bit better than the orange end and
 

207
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,490
bit better than the orange end and
yellow sanded right aesthetically I

208
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,500
yellow sanded right aesthetically I
 

209
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,580
yellow sanded right aesthetically I
think it's nicer when we make a game or

210
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:36,590
think it's nicer when we make a game or
 

211
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,380
think it's nicer when we make a game or
a redstone project we want to really

212
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,390
a redstone project we want to really
 

213
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,650
a redstone project we want to really
consider how it's gonna look before we

214
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:41,660
consider how it's gonna look before we
 

215
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,570
consider how it's gonna look before we
do the redstone wiring like the complex

216
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,580
do the redstone wiring like the complex
 

217
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,570
do the redstone wiring like the complex
part how much information can we see

218
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:46,580
part how much information can we see
 

219
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,410
part how much information can we see
when we're looking at the game right we

220
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:50,420
when we're looking at the game right we
 

221
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,940
when we're looking at the game right we
can almost see everything we can see the

222
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:51,950
can almost see everything we can see the
 

223
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,160
can almost see everything we can see the
full play field no problem and then our

224
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,170
full play field no problem and then our
 

225
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,420
full play field no problem and then our
white and black pegs are gonna be

226
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,430
white and black pegs are gonna be
 

227
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,980
white and black pegs are gonna be
displayed on the side here so if we have

228
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:56,990
displayed on the side here so if we have
 

229
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,440
displayed on the side here so if we have
one white peg this lamp will be on if we

230
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,450
one white peg this lamp will be on if we
 

231
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,630
one white peg this lamp will be on if we
have two this will be on two this will

232
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:01,640
have two this will be on two this will
 

233
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,140
have two this will be on two this will
be on for three this will be on for four

234
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,150
be on for three this will be on for four
 

235
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,520
be on for three this will be on for four
black pegs will be on this side one two

236
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,530
black pegs will be on this side one two
 

237
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,430
black pegs will be on this side one two
three four in mastermind it's actually

238
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
three four in mastermind it's actually
 

239
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,020
three four in mastermind it's actually
very rare that you get like three or

240
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,030
very rare that you get like three or
 

241
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,080
very rare that you get like three or
four pegs of any color so these top two

242
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,090
four pegs of any color so these top two
 

243
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,700
four pegs of any color so these top two
grows almost will never be used so we

244
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:18,710
grows almost will never be used so we
 

245
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,130
grows almost will never be used so we
can see like everything then if you if

246
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,140
can see like everything then if you if
 

247
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,710
can see like everything then if you if
you consider that even if we look at

248
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:23,720
you consider that even if we look at
 

249
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,180
you consider that even if we look at
this we can see the third row pretty

250
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,190
this we can see the third row pretty
 

251
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,100
this we can see the third row pretty
good it would be better if we could

252
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,110
good it would be better if we could
 

253
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,420
good it would be better if we could
squish it all together but that's just

254
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,430
squish it all together but that's just
 

255
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,600
squish it all together but that's just
gonna be too hard I could do it if I

256
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,610
gonna be too hard I could do it if I
 

257
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,040
gonna be too hard I could do it if I
really wanted but the games gonna get

258
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,050
really wanted but the games gonna get
 

259
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,640
really wanted but the games gonna get
way way bigger more complex I think

260
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,650
way way bigger more complex I think
 

261
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,790
way way bigger more complex I think
there's a way of doing that now with

262
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
there's a way of doing that now with
 

263
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,220
there's a way of doing that now with
observers like company clumping

264
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,230
observers like company clumping
 

265
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,020
observers like company clumping
glowstone walls together and getting it

266
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,030
glowstone walls together and getting it
 

267
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,780
glowstone walls together and getting it
to work so this is the way the redstone

268
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:46,790
to work so this is the way the redstone
 

269
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,520
to work so this is the way the redstone
is it's actually very compact I like it

270
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,530
is it's actually very compact I like it
 

271
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,610
is it's actually very compact I like it
basically we go up here run run our

272
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:54,620
basically we go up here run run our
 

273
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,910
basically we go up here run run our
hoppers sideways this is nice because

274
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:57,920
hoppers sideways this is nice because
 

275
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
hoppers sideways this is nice because
the hoppers store the information we can

276
00:05:59,920 --> 00:05:59,930
the hoppers store the information we can
 

277
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,290
the hoppers store the information we can
move it we can reset it it meets all the

278
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,300
move it we can reset it it meets all the
 

279
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,330
move it we can reset it it meets all the
criteria we're looking for with our

280
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,340
criteria we're looking for with our
 

281
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,820
criteria we're looking for with our
redstone design here so that's that's

282
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:06,830
redstone design here so that's that's
 

283
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,370
redstone design here so that's that's
great we'll lock it with the red stone

284
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,380
great we'll lock it with the red stone
 

285
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,030
great we'll lock it with the red stone
above comparators we'll go in side like

286
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,040
above comparators we'll go in side like
 

287
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,380
above comparators we'll go in side like
this they won't interfere with each

288
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,390
this they won't interfere with each
 

289
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,590
this they won't interfere with each
other because we left that space so all

290
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
other because we left that space so all
 

291
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,470
other because we left that space so all
in all I think we're pretty good here so

292
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,480
in all I think we're pretty good here so
 

293
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,180
in all I think we're pretty good here so
like every single block is used hopper

294
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,190
like every single block is used hopper
 

295
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,100
like every single block is used hopper
there comparator we need that block

296
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,110
there comparator we need that block
 

297
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,780
there comparator we need that block
there we need the redstone there so it's

298
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:25,790
there we need the redstone there so it's
 

299
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,370
there we need the redstone there so it's
a pretty compact way of doing it so now

300
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:30,380
a pretty compact way of doing it so now
 

301
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,410
a pretty compact way of doing it so now
we need to add some mechanisms for

302
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:32,420
we need to add some mechanisms for
 

303
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,390
we need to add some mechanisms for
controlling our four rows so that they

304
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
controlling our four rows so that they
 

305
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
controlling our four rows so that they
work together in unison because we

306
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,010
work together in unison because we
 

307
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,340
work together in unison because we
always want to lock and unlock all four

308
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,350
always want to lock and unlock all four
 

309
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,879
always want to lock and unlock all four
rows of hoppers at the exact

310
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:40,889
rows of hoppers at the exact
 

311
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,529
rows of hoppers at the exact
same time as each other so redstone only

312
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:45,539
same time as each other so redstone only
 

313
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,869
same time as each other so redstone only
travels 15 blocks right so we got to do

314
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:47,879
travels 15 blocks right so we got to do
 

315
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,399
travels 15 blocks right so we got to do
something like this I think that'll

316
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:49,409
something like this I think that'll
 

317
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,279
something like this I think that'll
power that row and then if we put a

318
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,289
power that row and then if we put a
 

319
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,260
power that row and then if we put a
redstone dust on there it'll power the

320
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,270
redstone dust on there it'll power the
 

321
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,649
redstone dust on there it'll power the
second row and then we'll do that again

322
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:56,659
second row and then we'll do that again
 

323
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:02,510
second row and then we'll do that again
at this level oops this place yeah we'll

324
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
at this level oops this place yeah we'll
 

325
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,089
at this level oops this place yeah we'll
put another repeater here and we just

326
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,099
put another repeater here and we just
 

327
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,010
put another repeater here and we just
got to link these two repeaters together

328
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
got to link these two repeaters together
 

329
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,879
got to link these two repeaters together
and they'll control all four of these oh

330
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:09,889
and they'll control all four of these oh
 

331
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,409
and they'll control all four of these oh
yeah so things are happening here guys

332
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:12,419
yeah so things are happening here guys
 

333
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,510
yeah so things are happening here guys
it's coming together I'm liking it we

334
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,520
it's coming together I'm liking it we
 

335
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,459
it's coming together I'm liking it we
got our two repeaters linked together so

336
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:16,469
got our two repeaters linked together so
 

337
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,619
got our two repeaters linked together so
the redstone torch goes up up a

338
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:18,629
the redstone torch goes up up a
 

339
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,839
the redstone torch goes up up a
staircase to that one which means when

340
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:20,849
staircase to that one which means when
 

341
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,869
staircase to that one which means when
we flip the lever here we can lock or

342
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:23,879
we flip the lever here we can lock or
 

343
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,300
we flip the lever here we can lock or
unlock all 48 hoppers at once with the

344
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,310
unlock all 48 hoppers at once with the
 

345
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,149
unlock all 48 hoppers at once with the
exact same timing as each other as we

346
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:29,159
exact same timing as each other as we
 

347
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,360
exact same timing as each other as we
choose as we so please which is awesome

348
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,370
choose as we so please which is awesome
 

349
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,679
choose as we so please which is awesome
so the whole unit is controlled from a

350
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:33,689
so the whole unit is controlled from a
 

351
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,959
so the whole unit is controlled from a
single power source which is great we

352
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:35,969
single power source which is great we
 

353
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,320
single power source which is great we
also want to do that for the items oh we

354
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,330
also want to do that for the items oh we
 

355
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,269
also want to do that for the items oh we
need a system for deciding okay did I

356
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:41,279
need a system for deciding okay did I
 

357
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,189
need a system for deciding okay did I
put the item in the bottom row that one

358
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
put the item in the bottom row that one
 

359
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,769
put the item in the bottom row that one
that one that one depending on how many

360
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:45,779
that one that one depending on how many
 

361
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,179
that one that one depending on how many
pulses we send the a dropper so we have

362
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:50,189
pulses we send the a dropper so we have
 

363
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:53,959
pulses we send the a dropper so we have
a dropper up here if we have like one

364
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:53,969
a dropper up here if we have like one
 

365
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,579
a dropper up here if we have like one
black peg we want to send this one pulse

366
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:55,589
black peg we want to send this one pulse
 

367
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,459
black peg we want to send this one pulse
2 4 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 and then have it

368
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:58,469
2 4 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 and then have it
 

369
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,589
2 4 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 and then have it
decide automatically okay which which

370
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,599
decide automatically okay which which
 

371
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,459
decide automatically okay which which
row does it go into so I've added in a

372
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:04,469
row does it go into so I've added in a
 

373
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,670
row does it go into so I've added in a
column of hoppers here as a bit of a

374
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
column of hoppers here as a bit of a
 

375
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,260
column of hoppers here as a bit of a
buffer so things that can get into

376
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,270
buffer so things that can get into
 

377
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,689
buffer so things that can get into
position before they're shown up on the

378
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:11,699
position before they're shown up on the
 

379
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,670
position before they're shown up on the
glowstone so that there's no like delay

380
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
glowstone so that there's no like delay
 

381
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,700
glowstone so that there's no like delay
issues or anything like that so if we

382
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:19,710
issues or anything like that so if we
 

383
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,170
issues or anything like that so if we
want to send it to the bottom row of

384
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,180
want to send it to the bottom row of
 

385
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,269
want to send it to the bottom row of
glowstone we want the items end up here

386
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:23,279
glowstone we want the items end up here
 

387
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,649
glowstone we want the items end up here
for the second row here third row up

388
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:27,659
for the second row here third row up
 

389
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,920
for the second row here third row up
there right the way we control that you

390
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:30,930
there right the way we control that you
 

391
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,170
there right the way we control that you
see I've branched off from our our lock

392
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,180
see I've branched off from our our lock
 

393
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,909
see I've branched off from our our lock
lines here there's a repeater that keeps

394
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:34,919
lines here there's a repeater that keeps
 

395
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,870
lines here there's a repeater that keeps
this locked or that wait that's not

396
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
this locked or that wait that's not
 

397
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,670
this locked or that wait that's not
necessary for the bottom it oh yeah it

398
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,680
necessary for the bottom it oh yeah it
 

399
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,819
necessary for the bottom it oh yeah it
is it is otherwise it'll flow into but

400
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:43,829
is it is otherwise it'll flow into but
 

401
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,660
is it is otherwise it'll flow into but
what that is click I heard a click

402
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:47,670
what that is click I heard a click
 

403
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,850
what that is click I heard a click
what was that we're probably not

404
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:49,860
what was that we're probably not
 

405
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,079
what was that we're probably not
important yeah anyway so when we send

406
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:54,089
important yeah anyway so when we send
 

407
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:54,769
important yeah anyway so when we send
this draw

408
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:54,779
this draw
 

409
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,920
this draw
for a pulse it'll shoot an item in and

410
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:56,930
for a pulse it'll shoot an item in and
 

411
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,139
for a pulse it'll shoot an item in and
then this hopper pulls it down this one

412
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:00,149
then this hopper pulls it down this one
 

413
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,610
then this hopper pulls it down this one
pulls it down it keeps getting pulled

414
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:01,620
pulls it down it keeps getting pulled
 

415
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,559
pulls it down it keeps getting pulled
down right to the bottom here and you

416
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:03,569
down right to the bottom here and you
 

417
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,410
down right to the bottom here and you
see this comparator turned on I took it

418
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,420
see this comparator turned on I took it
 

419
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,210
see this comparator turned on I took it
out let's try it again that redstone

420
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,220
out let's try it again that redstone
 

421
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,379
out let's try it again that redstone
down there turns on which power is this

422
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:14,389
down there turns on which power is this
 

423
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,629
down there turns on which power is this
hopper over here so this hopper is

424
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:17,639
hopper over here so this hopper is
 

425
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,460
hopper over here so this hopper is
locked it won't pull out of this hopper

426
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,470
locked it won't pull out of this hopper
 

427
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,259
locked it won't pull out of this hopper
anymore so the net that means the next

428
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:21,269
anymore so the net that means the next
 

429
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,689
anymore so the net that means the next
one's gonna end up in here and it just

430
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:23,699
one's gonna end up in here and it just
 

431
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,889
one's gonna end up in here and it just
does a like a staircase up next one is

432
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:27,899
does a like a staircase up next one is
 

433
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,999
does a like a staircase up next one is
in here right and again it it locks in

434
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,009
in here right and again it it locks in
 

435
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,160
in here right and again it it locks in
the next one so it's gonna end up in

436
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,170
the next one so it's gonna end up in
 

437
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,980
the next one so it's gonna end up in
here it locks the next one so that one

438
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:36,990
here it locks the next one so that one
 

439
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,299
here it locks the next one so that one
stays in here so if there's four pegs

440
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:40,309
stays in here so if there's four pegs
 

441
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,499
stays in here so if there's four pegs
that fills up from the bottom to the top

442
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:42,509
that fills up from the bottom to the top
 

443
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,809
that fills up from the bottom to the top
that way and then when we unlock the

444
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:44,819
that way and then when we unlock the
 

445
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,350
that way and then when we unlock the
hoppers they are free to flow to our

446
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,360
hoppers they are free to flow to our
 

447
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,569
hoppers they are free to flow to our
glowstone display here right now they're

448
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:50,579
glowstone display here right now they're
 

449
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,730
glowstone display here right now they're
just in a buffer and storage if we did

450
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:55,740
just in a buffer and storage if we did
 

451
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,259
just in a buffer and storage if we did
like a quick pulse like that'll it'll

452
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:57,269
like a quick pulse like that'll it'll
 

453
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,650
like a quick pulse like that'll it'll
flow one space right so that's good that

454
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:00,660
flow one space right so that's good that
 

455
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,660
flow one space right so that's good that
we can make it go down Lane here and

456
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:05,670
we can make it go down Lane here and
 

457
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,730
we can make it go down Lane here and
then at the end of the game when we win

458
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:07,740
then at the end of the game when we win
 

459
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,369
then at the end of the game when we win
or lose we can just clear the display by

460
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:10,379
or lose we can just clear the display by
 

461
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,170
or lose we can just clear the display by
keeping this unpowered for a while and

462
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,180
keeping this unpowered for a while and
 

463
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,199
keeping this unpowered for a while and
it'll just float up down to the end it

464
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:15,209
it'll just float up down to the end it
 

465
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:17,240
it'll just float up down to the end it
gets the ends we collect all the items

466
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,250
gets the ends we collect all the items
 

467
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,129
gets the ends we collect all the items
together with another column of hoppers

468
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:19,139
together with another column of hoppers
 

469
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,129
together with another column of hoppers
and going a chest here for right now if

470
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:22,139
and going a chest here for right now if
 

471
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,780
and going a chest here for right now if
we want we can recycle them and send

472
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:23,790
we want we can recycle them and send
 

473
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,280
we want we can recycle them and send
them back to the start there and then

474
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,290
them back to the start there and then
 

475
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,590
them back to the start there and then
it'll be a perfect closed system or we

476
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
it'll be a perfect closed system or we
 

477
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,749
it'll be a perfect closed system or we
can just keep a big big stash of them in

478
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:29,759
can just keep a big big stash of them in
 

479
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,369
can just keep a big big stash of them in

00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:57,269
I did see the comments on last episode
 

495
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,329

them is fine that will work fine we just

506
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,010
them is fine that will work fine we just
 

507
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,019
them is fine that will work fine we just
have to like connect those pressure

508
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:12,029
have to like connect those pressure
 

509

plates up to that dropper on one of the

510
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:14,520
plates up to that dropper on one of the
 

511
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,600
plates up to that dropper on one of the
sides and it's pretty much good to go

512
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,610
sides and it's pretty much good to go
 

513
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,300
sides and it's pretty much good to go
but the white pegs gotta figure out how

514
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,310
but the white pegs gotta figure out how
 

515
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,250
but the white pegs gotta figure out how
to do that differently so just letting

516
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,260
to do that differently so just letting
 

517
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,139
to do that differently so just letting
you know I saw it I'll hopefully figure

518
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,149
you know I saw it I'll hopefully figure
 

519
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,850
you know I saw it I'll hopefully figure
it out we're not gonna do that this

520
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:25,860
it out we're not gonna do that this
 

521
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,230
it out we're not gonna do that this
episode we're just gonna look at one

522
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
episode we're just gonna look at one
 

523
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,670
episode we're just gonna look at one
other thing today and then we'll move on

524
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
other thing today and then we'll move on
 

525
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,889
other thing today and then we'll move on
to some other stuff here the way we're

526
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:30,899
to some other stuff here the way we're
 

527
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,780
to some other stuff here the way we're
gonna generate the random code to our

528
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:32,790
gonna generate the random code to our
 

529
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,810
gonna generate the random code to our
game also had an issue we were gonna use

530
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:35,820
game also had an issue we were gonna use
 

531
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,680
game also had an issue we were gonna use
for droppers with six random colors in

532
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:38,690
for droppers with six random colors in
 

533
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,389
for droppers with six random colors in
they would drop down on the ice here we

534
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:41,399
they would drop down on the ice here we
 

535
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,970
they would drop down on the ice here we
had an issue where they were sliding a

536
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:43,980
had an issue where they were sliding a
 

537
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,790
had an issue where they were sliding a
lot of you suggested I use cobwebs put

538
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
lot of you suggested I use cobwebs put
 

539
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,310
lot of you suggested I use cobwebs put
those in front of the droppers and

540
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
those in front of the droppers and
 

541
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,360
those in front of the droppers and
that'll that'll stop all horizontal

542
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,370
that'll that'll stop all horizontal
 

543
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,070
that'll that'll stop all horizontal
momentum and it'll fall straight down

544
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,080
momentum and it'll fall straight down
 

545
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
momentum and it'll fall straight down
they'll have a bit of delay but it'll

546
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:56,730
they'll have a bit of delay but it'll
 

547
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,180
they'll have a bit of delay but it'll
work but we're not gonna do that we're

548
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,190
work but we're not gonna do that we're
 

549
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,740
work but we're not gonna do that we're
gonna do a completely different system

550
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:00,750
gonna do a completely different system
 

551
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,050
gonna do a completely different system
here because another issue is we only

552
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,060
here because another issue is we only
 

553
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,090
here because another issue is we only
had five minutes to finish a game and it

554
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
had five minutes to finish a game and it
 

555
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,730
had five minutes to finish a game and it
seems like that might actually be a

556
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:07,740
seems like that might actually be a
 

557
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,440
seems like that might actually be a
pretty big problem so the going

558
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,450
pretty big problem so the going
 

559
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,600
pretty big problem so the going
recommendation by a lot of you guys and

560
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:14,610
recommendation by a lot of you guys and
 

561
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,610
recommendation by a lot of you guys and
even doc hemmed messaged me about it is

562
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:16,620
even doc hemmed messaged me about it is
 

563
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,280
even doc hemmed messaged me about it is
to use shulker boxes all right so that's

564
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,290
to use shulker boxes all right so that's
 

565
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,120
to use shulker boxes all right so that's
what we're gonna do

566
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,130
what we're gonna do
 

567
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,110
what we're gonna do
I should let's go over here first so we

568
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,120
I should let's go over here first so we
 

569
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,590
I should let's go over here first so we
can see something so the plan is we also

570
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
can see something so the plan is we also
 

571
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,620
can see something so the plan is we also
wanted a way to see the code at the end

572
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,630
wanted a way to see the code at the end
 

573
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,690
wanted a way to see the code at the end
of the game if we win or lose we don't

574
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:32,700
of the game if we win or lose we don't
 

575
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,190
of the game if we win or lose we don't
want it to be hidden underground their

576
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,200
want it to be hidden underground their
 

577
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,050
want it to be hidden underground their
rule where we'll never see it right we

578
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,060
rule where we'll never see it right we
 

579
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,949
rule where we'll never see it right we
want to know why we won or lost the game

580
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
want to know why we won or lost the game
 

581
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,850
want to know why we won or lost the game
so we're gonna have like a shudder

582
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:40,860
so we're gonna have like a shudder
 

583
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,320
so we're gonna have like a shudder
system at the end there and I got

584
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,330
system at the end there and I got
 

585
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,019
system at the end there and I got
nothing to throw against oh I still got

586
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:48,029
nothing to throw against oh I still got
 

587
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:48,980
nothing to throw against oh I still got
it though look at that

588
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:48,990
it though look at that
 

589
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,420
it though look at that
Oh on and I fell down anyway so there's

590
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,430
Oh on and I fell down anyway so there's
 

591
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh on and I fell down anyway so there's
gonna be control here to flip that up at

592
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,010
gonna be control here to flip that up at
 

593
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,949
gonna be control here to flip that up at
the end of the game if we win or lose

594
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:57,959
the end of the game if we win or lose
 

595
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,380
the end of the game if we win or lose
and then that's gonna reveal the code in

596
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,390
and then that's gonna reveal the code in
 

597
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,460
and then that's gonna reveal the code in
front of us and we're gonna use

598
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,470
front of us and we're gonna use
 

599
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,280
front of us and we're gonna use
dispensers to play shocker boxes

600
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,290
dispensers to play shocker boxes
 

601
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,519
dispensers to play shocker boxes
randomly each dispenser will have six

602
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:07,529
randomly each dispenser will have six
 

603
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,210
randomly each dispenser will have six
different colors of shocker boxes in so

604
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
different colors of shocker boxes in so
 

605
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,569
different colors of shocker boxes in so
we need 24 total which we don't have by

606
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:14,579
we need 24 total which we don't have by
 

607
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,269
we need 24 total which we don't have by
the way this is a survival world's you

608
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
the way this is a survival world's you
 

609
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,390
the way this is a survival world's you
think I got 24 just laying around no

610
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,400
think I got 24 just laying around no
 

611
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,079
think I got 24 just laying around no
we're gonna have to go get those

612
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:23,089
we're gonna have to go get those
 

613
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,110
we're gonna have to go get those
which is gonna be tricky so these

614
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
which is gonna be tricky so these
 

615
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,250
which is gonna be tricky so these
dispensers they'll have the shelter

616
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,260
dispensers they'll have the shelter
 

617
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,660
dispensers they'll have the shelter
boxes in then this line of wire here is

618
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:32,670
boxes in then this line of wire here is
 

619
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,990
boxes in then this line of wire here is
gonna be used to place them now the

620
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
gonna be used to place them now the
 

621
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,180
gonna be used to place them now the
shelter boxes are going to have concrete

622
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,190
shelter boxes are going to have concrete
 

623
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,210
shelter boxes are going to have concrete
powder inside as well and that's gonna

624
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,220
powder inside as well and that's gonna
 

625
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
powder inside as well and that's gonna
flow down to our ice stream system there

626
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,230
flow down to our ice stream system there
 

627
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,710
flow down to our ice stream system there
every time we enter an answer we're

628
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
every time we enter an answer we're
 

629
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,199
every time we enter an answer we're
gonna refresh it so we will be able to

630
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:48,209
gonna refresh it so we will be able to
 

631
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,790
gonna refresh it so we will be able to
make a game we go longer than five

632
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:49,800
make a game we go longer than five
 

633
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,480
make a game we go longer than five
minutes so we'll take one item out of

634
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,490
minutes so we'll take one item out of
 

635
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,150
minutes so we'll take one item out of
the Shocker box and we got to send it

636
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
the Shocker box and we got to send it
 

637
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,540
the Shocker box and we got to send it
down to a dropper probably shoot it out

638
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,550
down to a dropper probably shoot it out
 

639
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,380
down to a dropper probably shoot it out
and I'll land on the ice down there so

640
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,390
and I'll land on the ice down there so
 

641
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,350
and I'll land on the ice down there so
to do that we're gonna unpowered this

642
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,360
to do that we're gonna unpowered this
 

643
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,780
to do that we're gonna unpowered this
this hopper here if we do that they flow

644
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:11,790
this hopper here if we do that they flow
 

645
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,440
this hopper here if we do that they flow
into there we want them to flow downward

646
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,450
into there we want them to flow downward
 

647
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,480
into there we want them to flow downward
though so we have like a switching

648
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,490
though so we have like a switching
 

649
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,310
though so we have like a switching
system here it can either float down or

650
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,320
system here it can either float down or
 

651
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,440
system here it can either float down or
to the right into this dropper this is

652
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,450
to the right into this dropper this is
 

653
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,470
to the right into this dropper this is
where we want the shulker box to go

654
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,480
where we want the shulker box to go
 

655
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,819
where we want the shulker box to go
because after this after we break it we

656
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:28,829
because after this after we break it we
 

657
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,170
because after this after we break it we
can use pistons to break the shell core

658
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,180
can use pistons to break the shell core
 

659
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,630
can use pistons to break the shell core
box so we want that to go in here oh and

660
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:32,640
box so we want that to go in here oh and
 

661
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,000
box so we want that to go in here oh and
it where'd it go oh did it go to the one

662
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,010
it where'd it go oh did it go to the one
 

663
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,160
it where'd it go oh did it go to the one
beside it I was really worried that was

664
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,170
beside it I was really worried that was
 

665
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,850
beside it I was really worried that was
gonna happen

666
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:40,860
gonna happen
 

667
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,639
gonna happen
Wow and all my testing I couldn't get

668
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:43,649
Wow and all my testing I couldn't get
 

669
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,540
Wow and all my testing I couldn't get
that to happen and it happened now oh

670
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,550
that to happen and it happened now oh
 

671
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:55,930
that to happen and it happened now oh
this might have a flaw then really that

672
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:55,940

 

673
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,150

time it went there okay you're gonna

674
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,160
time it went there okay you're gonna
 

675
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,560
time it went there okay you're gonna
have to test that a bit more I guess

676
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:00,570
have to test that a bit more I guess
 

677
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,010
have to test that a bit more I guess
that would be pretty critical because we

678
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,020
that would be pretty critical because we
 

679
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,720
that would be pretty critical because we
want to be able to reset this like we

680
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:05,730
want to be able to reset this like we
 

681
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,699
want to be able to reset this like we
need the Shanker box to go back into the

682
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:07,709
need the Shanker box to go back into the
 

683
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,160
need the Shanker box to go back into the
dispenser it came from that goes into

684
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,170
dispenser it came from that goes into
 

685
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,780
dispenser it came from that goes into
another one then we won't be able to

686
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:11,790
another one then we won't be able to
 

687
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,699
another one then we won't be able to
generate a random code it's gonna be

688
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:13,709
generate a random code it's gonna be
 

689
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,980
generate a random code it's gonna be
like if one of these dispensers has two

690
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:15,990
like if one of these dispensers has two
 

691
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,350
like if one of these dispensers has two
yellow ones in it's only gonna it'll be

692
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:18,360
yellow ones in it's only gonna it'll be
 

693
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,970
yellow ones in it's only gonna it'll be
impossible have to have like a yellow

694
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:19,980
impossible have to have like a yellow
 

695
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,850
impossible have to have like a yellow
yellow yellow yellow code cuz only one's

696
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:22,860
yellow yellow yellow code cuz only one's
 

697
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,269
yellow yellow yellow code cuz only one's
gonna come out okay I have an idea here

698
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:26,279
gonna come out okay I have an idea here
 

699
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,850
gonna come out okay I have an idea here
rather than squishing the shulker boxes

700
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:28,860
rather than squishing the shulker boxes
 

701
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,069
rather than squishing the shulker boxes
with the the piston heads we're gonna

702
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:31,079
with the the piston heads we're gonna
 

703
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,860
with the the piston heads we're gonna
use sticky pistons and maybe trapdoors

704
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:33,870
use sticky pistons and maybe trapdoors
 

705
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,689
use sticky pistons and maybe trapdoors
will work we'll flip them over

706
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:35,699
will work we'll flip them over
 

707
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,289
will work we'll flip them over
like this and that's gonna come down it

708
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:39,299
like this and that's gonna come down it
 

709
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,109
like this and that's gonna come down it
and pop the shawl cur boxes I'm hoping

710
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:42,119
and pop the shawl cur boxes I'm hoping
 

711
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,729
and pop the shawl cur boxes I'm hoping
the trap doors are gonna act as a

712
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:43,739
the trap doors are gonna act as a
 

713
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,829
the trap doors are gonna act as a
barrier to prevent them from hopping

714
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
barrier to prevent them from hopping
 

715
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,650
barrier to prevent them from hopping
over to the block beside them because it

716
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:48,660
over to the block beside them because it
 

717
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,319
over to the block beside them because it
creates like a wall here I don't know if

718
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:51,329
creates like a wall here I don't know if
 

719
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:52,519
creates like a wall here I don't know if
that's gonna work I'm gonna test sell a

720
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:52,529
that's gonna work I'm gonna test sell a
 

721
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:57,829
that's gonna work I'm gonna test sell a
little bit here okay purple green purple

722
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
little bit here okay purple green purple
 

723
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,189
little bit here okay purple green purple
yo so first first tries a success I'm

724
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
yo so first first tries a success I'm
 

725
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,079
yo so first first tries a success I'm
gonna do it a few times here just to be

726
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:03,089
gonna do it a few times here just to be
 

727
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,689
gonna do it a few times here just to be
sure see if we have any problems cuz I

728
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:05,699
sure see if we have any problems cuz I
 

729
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,579
sure see if we have any problems cuz I
make that mistake a lot when I'm

730
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:07,589
make that mistake a lot when I'm
 

731
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,439
make that mistake a lot when I'm
building something I'll test it once one

732
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:09,449
building something I'll test it once one
 

733
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:11,269
building something I'll test it once one
or two or three times but then it it

734
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
or two or three times but then it it
 

735
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,030
or two or three times but then it it
fails later it's like oh man

736
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
fails later it's like oh man
 

737
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,629
fails later it's like oh man
I designed the whole thing around this

738
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
I designed the whole thing around this
 

739
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,579
I designed the whole thing around this
and now it doesn't work because of some

740
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:19,589
and now it doesn't work because of some
 

741
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:21,889
and now it doesn't work because of some
random chance I didn't detect before so

742
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:21,899
random chance I didn't detect before so
 

743
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,960
random chance I didn't detect before so
you gotta like really really try this

744
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,970
you gotta like really really try this
 

745
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,259
you gotta like really really try this
stuff out this is a very random thing it

746
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:27,269
stuff out this is a very random thing it
 

747
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,669
stuff out this is a very random thing it
could be like a one in a hundred who

748
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:28,679
could be like a one in a hundred who
 

749
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,159
could be like a one in a hundred who
knows I'm not gonna test it a hundred

750
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,169
knows I'm not gonna test it a hundred
 

751
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,309
knows I'm not gonna test it a hundred
times but probably 10 is good enough

752
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
times but probably 10 is good enough
 

753
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,319
times but probably 10 is good enough
right uh-huh

754
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:36,329
right uh-huh
 

755
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,780
right uh-huh
so I tried that at least 10 times and it

756
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:38,790
so I tried that at least 10 times and it
 

757
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,159
so I tried that at least 10 times and it
didn't fail so I think that's gonna work

758
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:40,169
didn't fail so I think that's gonna work
 

759
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,479
didn't fail so I think that's gonna work
I think I'll be good

760
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:41,489
I think I'll be good
 

761
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,099
I think I'll be good
I just realized we're kind of getting

762
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:43,109
I just realized we're kind of getting
 

763
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,049
I just realized we're kind of getting
along in the episode already so let's

764
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:45,059
along in the episode already so let's
 

765
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:46,609
along in the episode already so let's
change things up let's get some

766
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:46,619
change things up let's get some
 

767
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,499
change things up let's get some
variations and adventure in our life

768
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:48,509
variations and adventure in our life
 

769
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,900
variations and adventure in our life
here we're gonna go to the end today

770
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:50,910
here we're gonna go to the end today
 

771
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,199
here we're gonna go to the end today
after all and go hunting for shelters so

772
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:54,209
after all and go hunting for shelters so
 

773
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,659
after all and go hunting for shelters so
that we can get our 24 shelter boxes for

774
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:56,669
that we can get our 24 shelter boxes for
 

775
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,129
that we can get our 24 shelter boxes for
that plus I wouldn't mind having a few

776
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:58,139
that plus I wouldn't mind having a few
 

777
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,579
that plus I wouldn't mind having a few
more as using the farm here the the reed

778
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:01,589
more as using the farm here the the reed
 

779
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,539
more as using the farm here the the reed
farm to get some paper for some maps

780
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:05,549
farm to get some paper for some maps
 

781
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,539
farm to get some paper for some maps
right and I think since I last showed

782
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:08,549
right and I think since I last showed
 

783
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,309
right and I think since I last showed
this in a video it's changed a little

784
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
this in a video it's changed a little
 

785
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,970
this in a video it's changed a little
bit so for one thing lily pads aren't

786
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:13,980
bit so for one thing lily pads aren't
 

787
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,350
bit so for one thing lily pads aren't
flat anymore like when you're walking

788
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
flat anymore like when you're walking
 

789
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,110
flat anymore like when you're walking
around in here it's bumpy kind of go up

and I just got a chest here let's

814
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:52,890
and I just got a chest here let's
 

815
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,410
and I just got a chest here let's
actually grab one more stack because I

816
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,420
actually grab one more stack because I
 

817
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,000

requires so last time we did this was

820
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,310
requires so last time we did this was
 

821
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,770
requires so last time we did this was
quite a while ago it was back when we

822
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:00,780
quite a while ago it was back when we
 

823
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,530
quite a while ago it was back when we
still had to do Bo boosting like where

824
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:03,540
still had to do Bo boosting like where
 

825
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,780
still had to do Bo boosting like where
you shoot yourself with an arrow to get

826
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,790
you shoot yourself with an arrow to get
 

827
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,580
you shoot yourself with an arrow to get
launched in the air we had a lighter

828
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:07,590
launched in the air we had a lighter
 

829
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,490
launched in the air we had a lighter
wings but and the map feature just came

830
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,500
wings but and the map feature just came
 

831
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,770
wings but and the map feature just came
out where you can map the end so this is

832
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:12,780
out where you can map the end so this is
 

833
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,200
out where you can map the end so this is
the map we made and you see all the

834
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,210
the map we made and you see all the
 

835
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,260
the map we made and you see all the
purple spots are are the N CDs or

836
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,270
purple spots are are the N CDs or
 

837
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,780
purple spots are are the N CDs or
whatever this time I'm going to try

838
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:19,790
whatever this time I'm going to try
 

839
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,280
whatever this time I'm going to try
bring banners with me we'll name them

840
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,290
bring banners with me we'll name them
 

841
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,140
bring banners with me we'll name them
we'll give them the coordinates of where

842
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,150
we'll give them the coordinates of where
 

843
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,580
we'll give them the coordinates of where
it is because I'm just looking at this

844
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:25,590
it is because I'm just looking at this
 

845
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,110
it is because I'm just looking at this
map here I have no idea which direction

846
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
map here I have no idea which direction
 

847
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,770
map here I have no idea which direction
to go to be honest I think I think I

848
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:30,780
to go to be honest I think I think I
 

849
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,930
to go to be honest I think I think I
laid it out so that up on the map is

850
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:32,940
laid it out so that up on the map is
 

851
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,750
laid it out so that up on the map is
forward but I'm not sure so anyways this

852
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:38,760
forward but I'm not sure so anyways this
 

853
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,910
forward but I'm not sure so anyways this
might be a lot easier now that we have

854
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:40,920
might be a lot easier now that we have
 

855
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,730
might be a lot easier now that we have
the fireworks just fly around though so

856
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:43,740
the fireworks just fly around though so
 

857
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,750
the fireworks just fly around though so
I'm just gonna fly 2,000 blocks this way

858
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:46,760
I'm just gonna fly 2,000 blocks this way
 

859
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,370
I'm just gonna fly 2,000 blocks this way
yeah doing this with the the fireworks

860
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,380
yeah doing this with the the fireworks
 

861
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,720
yeah doing this with the the fireworks
is a lot easier like before you had very

862
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:53,730
is a lot easier like before you had very
 

863
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,580
is a lot easier like before you had very
little control by doing the bow boosting

864
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:55,590
little control by doing the bow boosting
 

865
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,830
little control by doing the bow boosting
and not only that but you were shooting

866
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
and not only that but you were shooting
 

867
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,920
and not only that but you were shooting
yourself so it's very easy to lose track

868
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:00,930
yourself so it's very easy to lose track
 

869
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,240
yourself so it's very easy to lose track
of your health and just shoot yourself

870
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,250
of your health and just shoot yourself
 

871
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,540
of your health and just shoot yourself
to death which is what I did a few times

872
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:04,550
to death which is what I did a few times
 

873
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,830
to death which is what I did a few times
so I think we've gone far enough for a

874
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:06,840
so I think we've gone far enough for a
 

875
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,010
so I think we've gone far enough for a
mm oh I went a little too far I think

876
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,020
mm oh I went a little too far I think
 

877
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,130
mm oh I went a little too far I think
2,900 so I always kind of forget how

878
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,140
2,900 so I always kind of forget how
 

879
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,550
2,900 so I always kind of forget how
maps work I think we can that then zoom

880
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,560
maps work I think we can that then zoom
 

881
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,260
maps work I think we can that then zoom
out alright somehow do we need a

882
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,270
out alright somehow do we need a
 

883
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,820
out alright somehow do we need a
crafting table to do it I think so I

884
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:25,830
crafting table to do it I think so I
 

885
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,940
crafting table to do it I think so I
think we got to do a ring around the map

886
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:28,950
think we got to do a ring around the map
 

887
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,340
think we got to do a ring around the map
now several times as well probably be

888
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,350
now several times as well probably be
 

889
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,050
now several times as well probably be
what did I say probably uh-huh okay so I

890
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,060
what did I say probably uh-huh okay so I
 

891
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,910
what did I say probably uh-huh okay so I
assumed that very good let's do that as

892
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:40,920
assumed that very good let's do that as
 

893
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,010
assumed that very good let's do that as
many times as we can here and do the

894
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,020
many times as we can here and do the
 

895
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,140
many times as we can here and do the
full wraparound okay and that's it okay

896
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,150
full wraparound okay and that's it okay
 

897
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,120
full wraparound okay and that's it okay
so let's oh I do see that I think it

898
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,130
so let's oh I do see that I think it
 

899
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,440
so let's oh I do see that I think it
consumed it one more time when I took it

900
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,450
consumed it one more time when I took it
 

901
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,970
consumed it one more time when I took it
out of there I'm gonna have to watch

902
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:52,980
out of there I'm gonna have to watch
 

903
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,190
out of there I'm gonna have to watch
that back I think it did though

904
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
that back I think it did though
 

905
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,680
that back I think it did though
oh we got one we got one oh it's a big

906
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:00,690
oh we got one we got one oh it's a big
 

907
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,510
oh we got one we got one oh it's a big
one too with a boat look at that

908
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:02,520
one too with a boat look at that
 

909
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,450
one too with a boat look at that
oh yeah there's banners at end cities

910
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:05,460
oh yeah there's banners at end cities
 

911
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,410
oh yeah there's banners at end cities
aren't there I didn't need to bring

912

1960 30 to 20 only one okay so 1960 30
to 20 let's do a comma we're gonna be

922
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:27,930
to 20 let's do a comma we're gonna be
 

923
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,990
to 20 let's do a comma we're gonna be
fancy like that or should we even do

924
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
fancy like that or should we even do
 

925
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,810
fancy like that or should we even do
brackets guys we're gonna do brackets oh

okay that'll go get our coordinates and

932
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:40,650
okay that'll go get our coordinates and
 

933
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,880
okay that'll go get our coordinates and
then we place it and now can we see them

934
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:46,890
then we place it and now can we see them
 

935
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,800
then we place it and now can we see them
on the map oh I need an item frame

936
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:48,810
on the map oh I need an item frame
 

937
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,780
on the map oh I need an item frame
whoops well we can't check it out I left
