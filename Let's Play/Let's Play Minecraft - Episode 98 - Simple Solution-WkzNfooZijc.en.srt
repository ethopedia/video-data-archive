00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,410
hello everyone this is Ethel still

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,160
hello everyone this is Ethel still
working on the mop system but it's

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,170
working on the mop system but it's
 

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,260
working on the mop system but it's
getting very close to complete things

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,270
getting very close to complete things
 

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,160
getting very close to complete things
are going really well I have made a

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,170
are going really well I have made a
 

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,839
are going really well I have made a
number of changes but yeah it's working

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:29,849
number of changes but yeah it's working
 

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,240
number of changes but yeah it's working
really well it's still not up to full

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,250
really well it's still not up to full
 

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,910
really well it's still not up to full
scale or full speed here but it's it's

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:34,920
scale or full speed here but it's it's
 

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,150
scale or full speed here but it's it's
getting there so I will take you up

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
getting there so I will take you up
 

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,709
getting there so I will take you up
there and I'll show you what's new

18
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
there and I'll show you what's new
 

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,290
there and I'll show you what's new
what's different here we are at the

20
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,300
what's different here we are at the
 

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,630
what's different here we are at the
tower you can see it's looking a little

22
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,640
tower you can see it's looking a little
 

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,270
tower you can see it's looking a little
bit different now for some reason it's

24
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,280
bit different now for some reason it's
 

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,220
bit different now for some reason it's
because I've made it smaller now I got

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,230
because I've made it smaller now I got
 

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,670
because I've made it smaller now I got
rid of the outside canals in it so two

28
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
rid of the outside canals in it so two
 

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,400
rid of the outside canals in it so two
blocks smaller all around it so four by

30
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,410
blocks smaller all around it so four by
 

31
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,330
blocks smaller all around it so four by
four or less in size and the wall is

32
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,340
four or less in size and the wall is
 

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,369
four or less in size and the wall is
here now instead of having the two wide

34
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:04,379
here now instead of having the two wide
 

35
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,330
here now instead of having the two wide
canals all around it's the thing so I

36
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:10,340
canals all around it's the thing so I
 

37
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,469
canals all around it's the thing so I
decided to do that to simplify things

38
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
decided to do that to simplify things
 

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,039
decided to do that to simplify things
and from what I can tell it's just as

40
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,049
and from what I can tell it's just as
 

41
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,580
and from what I can tell it's just as
efficient like this but I have no way of

42
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,590
efficient like this but I have no way of
 

43
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,230
efficient like this but I have no way of
knowing for sure without using like an

44
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
knowing for sure without using like an
 

45
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,330
knowing for sure without using like an
mcedit world and watching mobs spawn and

46
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,340
mcedit world and watching mobs spawn and
 

47
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,580
mcedit world and watching mobs spawn and
compare the rates between the two

48
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:28,590
compare the rates between the two
 

49
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,490
compare the rates between the two
methods and I just can't do that but

50
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,500
methods and I just can't do that but
 

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,890
methods and I just can't do that but
from my observations in this world it

52
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
from my observations in this world it
 

53
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,980
from my observations in this world it
seems about the same and the nice thing

54
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:36,990
seems about the same and the nice thing
 

55
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,350
seems about the same and the nice thing
about this style here it's a lot faster

56
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
about this style here it's a lot faster
 

57
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,190
about this style here it's a lot faster
to build simpler easy to understand it's

58
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
to build simpler easy to understand it's
 

59
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,230
to build simpler easy to understand it's
absolutely no signs in it now and yeah

60
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
absolutely no signs in it now and yeah
 

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,139
absolutely no signs in it now and yeah
it takes up less space so should be good

62
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:51,149
it takes up less space so should be good
 

63
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,060
it takes up less space so should be good
the way I have a water

64
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,070

 

65
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,550

it goes in like this it runs the full a

66
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
it goes in like this it runs the full a
 

67
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,920
it goes in like this it runs the full a
block lengths and ends it the hole there

68
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:02,930
block lengths and ends it the hole there
 

69
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,580
block lengths and ends it the hole there
so I'm liking this new style more I'm

70
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590
so I'm liking this new style more I'm
 

71
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,400
so I'm liking this new style more I'm
glad I made the change and this is kind

72
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,410
glad I made the change and this is kind
 

73
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,850
glad I made the change and this is kind
of what I'm recommending for hostile mob

74
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
of what I'm recommending for hostile mob
 

75
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,090
of what I'm recommending for hostile mob
systems now I may make a tutorial for

76
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,100
systems now I may make a tutorial for
 

77
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,240
systems now I may make a tutorial for
this if you guys want but I'm sure you

78
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,250
this if you guys want but I'm sure you
 

79
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,890
this if you guys want but I'm sure you
can figure it out just by looking at

80
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:21,900
can figure it out just by looking at
 

81
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,250
can figure it out just by looking at
this yeah I haven't fixed the lighting

82
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,260
this yeah I haven't fixed the lighting
 

83
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,620
this yeah I haven't fixed the lighting
yet I'll get to that pretty quick

84
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,630
yet I'll get to that pretty quick
 

85
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,470
yet I'll get to that pretty quick
and this outside stuff here I'll

86
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,480
and this outside stuff here I'll
 

87
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,220
and this outside stuff here I'll
probably remove but I'm not sure yet I'm

88
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,230
probably remove but I'm not sure yet I'm
 

89
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,960
probably remove but I'm not sure yet I'm
gonna leave it until I decide if I'm

90
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:38,970
gonna leave it until I decide if I'm
 

91
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,440
gonna leave it until I decide if I'm
building more than one Tower that's that

92
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,450
building more than one Tower that's that
 

93
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,979
building more than one Tower that's that
mate I might build two or three towers

94
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:45,989
mate I might build two or three towers
 

95
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,160
mate I might build two or three towers
or just leave it as one here haven't

96
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,170
or just leave it as one here haven't
 

97
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,170
or just leave it as one here haven't
decided so I'm just gonna leave this

98
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,180
decided so I'm just gonna leave this
 

99
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,259
decided so I'm just gonna leave this
extra bit here until I do decide anyway

100
00:02:59,259 --> 00:02:59,269
extra bit here until I do decide anyway
 

101
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,340
extra bit here until I do decide anyway
let's head up to the lighting room I

102
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,350
let's head up to the lighting room I
 

103
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,289
let's head up to the lighting room I
want to say thank you to everybody that

104
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:06,299
want to say thank you to everybody that
 

105
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,530
want to say thank you to everybody that
sent me video responses and suggestions

106
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,540
sent me video responses and suggestions
 

107
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,470
sent me video responses and suggestions
I would not have been able to figure out

108
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
I would not have been able to figure out
 

109
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,699
I would not have been able to figure out
the lighting thing on my own I don't

110
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:13,709
the lighting thing on my own I don't
 

111
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,229
the lighting thing on my own I don't
think so it's a big help and the

112
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
think so it's a big help and the
 

113
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,400
think so it's a big help and the
solution is very simple apparently

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,410

 

115
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,509

basically the problem I was having is

116
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:26,519
basically the problem I was having is
 

117
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,569
basically the problem I was having is
there's four blocks on every level of my

118
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:29,579
there's four blocks on every level of my
 

119
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,030
there's four blocks on every level of my
system that was only light level seven

120
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040
system that was only light level seven
 

121
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,130
system that was only light level seven
so mobs could spawn even if my

122
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,140
so mobs could spawn even if my
 

123
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,890
so mobs could spawn even if my
lightening was on so I gotta change what

124
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:39,900
lightening was on so I gotta change what
 

125
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,390
lightening was on so I gotta change what
I have in here you can see I'm watching

126
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
I have in here you can see I'm watching
 

127
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I have in here you can see I'm watching
on half slabs so mobs won't spawn in

128
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,410
on half slabs so mobs won't spawn in
 

129
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,610
on half slabs so mobs won't spawn in
here when it's completely dark and I

130
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
here when it's completely dark and I
 

131
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,160
here when it's completely dark and I
just had two levers one for water and

132
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,170
just had two levers one for water and
 

133
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,000
just had two levers one for water and
one for Lila

134
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,010

 

135
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,850

so I'm gonna work at applying the

136
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:00,860
so I'm gonna work at applying the
 

137
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,740
so I'm gonna work at applying the
changes you guys recommended and then I

138
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:02,750
changes you guys recommended and then I
 

139
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,390
changes you guys recommended and then I
will be back yeah yeah and a big thank

140
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,400
will be back yeah yeah and a big thank
 

141
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,740
will be back yeah yeah and a big thank
you to everybody that gave me

142
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750
you to everybody that gave me
 

143
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,510
you to everybody that gave me
suggestions on how to do the lighting

144
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:10,520
suggestions on how to do the lighting
 

145
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,660
suggestions on how to do the lighting
system the simplest solution

146
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,670
system the simplest solution
 

147
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,069
system the simplest solution
I think people gave me is I can just

148
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
I think people gave me is I can just
 

149
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,740
I think people gave me is I can just
copy what I have here will still be two

150
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:20,750
copy what I have here will still be two
 

151
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,340
copy what I have here will still be two
Pistons per 4 holes the only thing is I

152
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,350
Pistons per 4 holes the only thing is I
 

153
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,260
Pistons per 4 holes the only thing is I
need to change where the lava comes down

154
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,270
need to change where the lava comes down
 

155
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,780
need to change where the lava comes down
so the way I had it before lava was

156
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:28,790
so the way I had it before lava was
 

157
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,170
so the way I had it before lava was
coming down inside here this hole here

158
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,180
coming down inside here this hole here
 

159
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,530
coming down inside here this hole here
all these inside holes and then at the

160
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:35,540
all these inside holes and then at the
 

161
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,350
all these inside holes and then at the
very far end here there's one block that

162
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,360
very far end here there's one block that
 

163
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,200
very far end here there's one block that
was light level seven which is low

164
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,210
was light level seven which is low
 

165
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,040
was light level seven which is low
enough to allow mobs to spawn on it but

166
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,050
enough to allow mobs to spawn on it but
 

167
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,550
enough to allow mobs to spawn on it but
the trick that you guys gave me is I

168
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
the trick that you guys gave me is I
 

169
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,340
the trick that you guys gave me is I
need to kind of rotate the lava so I

170
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,350
need to kind of rotate the lava so I
 

171
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,990
need to kind of rotate the lava so I
need Labbit come down this hole here and

172
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000

 

173
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,250

leave this hole here this one here and

174
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,260
leave this hole here this one here and
 

175
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:13,090
leave this hole here this one here and
this one here and then what that does so

176
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,100
this one here and then what that does so
 

177
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,930
this one here and then what that does so
let's take this pad here for example the

178
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:15,940
let's take this pad here for example the
 

179
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,219
let's take this pad here for example the
light level seven block could be over

180
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:18,229
light level seven block could be over
 

181
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,800
light level seven block could be over
here but since lava will be over here

182
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,810
here but since lava will be over here
 

183
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,800
here but since lava will be over here
this lava light the dark spot on the

184
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:26,810
this lava light the dark spot on the
 

185
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,620
this lava light the dark spot on the
other pad so the lightning jumps pads

186
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,630
other pad so the lightning jumps pads
 

187
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,370
other pad so the lightning jumps pads
and they work together that way to

188
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:33,380
and they work together that way to
 

189
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,820
and they work together that way to
remove all the dark spots so it's really

190
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:36,830
remove all the dark spots so it's really
 

191
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,640
remove all the dark spots so it's really
awesome so I just need to change where I

192
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:39,650
awesome so I just need to change where I
 

193
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,170
awesome so I just need to change where I
have the lab coming down and since I

194
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,180
have the lab coming down and since I
 

195
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,990
have the lab coming down and since I
wanted yeah I have half slabs on this

196
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,000
wanted yeah I have half slabs on this
 

197
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,649
wanted yeah I have half slabs on this
stuff too it's really weird

198
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:53,659

 

199
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,899

so I'm going to move it how should I do

200
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:56,909
so I'm going to move it how should I do
 

201
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:09,199
so I'm going to move it how should I do
this I need to go like this and then

202
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,209
this I need to go like this and then
 

203
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,269
this I need to go like this and then
have slaps on top of that if I had

204
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:11,279
have slaps on top of that if I had
 

205
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,689
have slaps on top of that if I had
enough yeah and then I got to move this

206
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:17,699
enough yeah and then I got to move this
 

207
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,019
enough yeah and then I got to move this
stuff

208
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,029
stuff
 

209
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,279
stuff
I think the wiring will get a little bit

210
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,289
I think the wiring will get a little bit
 

211
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,859
I think the wiring will get a little bit
longer now but hey it's worth it if it

212
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:24,869
longer now but hey it's worth it if it
 

213
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,799
longer now but hey it's worth it if it
works so definitely gonna make the

214
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:27,809
works so definitely gonna make the
 

215
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:31,189
works so definitely gonna make the
change and it's getting dark in here so

216
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
change and it's getting dark in here so
 

217
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,540
change and it's getting dark in here so
maybe I'll finish this off camera I got

218
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:35,550
maybe I'll finish this off camera I got
 

219
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,129
maybe I'll finish this off camera I got
one left to do here so I'll show you how

220
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:37,139
one left to do here so I'll show you how
 

221
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:45,909
one left to do here so I'll show you how
to do it or how I have to fix it that's

222
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919

 

223
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,949

to keep this thin that controls the lava

224
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:48,959
to keep this thin that controls the lava
 

225
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:57,439
to keep this thin that controls the lava
and then we have regular piston please

226
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:57,449
and then we have regular piston please
 

227
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,670
and then we have regular piston please
set with a solid block and I

228
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
set with a solid block and I
 

229
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,949
set with a solid block and I
oops that doesn't go there buck there

230
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:08,959
oops that doesn't go there buck there
 

231
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,299
oops that doesn't go there buck there
make a little pocket to hold the lava

232
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:11,309
make a little pocket to hold the lava
 

233
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:14,359
make a little pocket to hold the lava
and then a little pocket to hold the

234
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:14,369
and then a little pocket to hold the
 

235
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:24,829
and then a little pocket to hold the
water here I believe that's it so lava

236
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:24,839
water here I believe that's it so lava
 

237
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,659
water here I believe that's it so lava
goes down here it'll flow like this and

238
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:28,669
goes down here it'll flow like this and
 

239
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,909
goes down here it'll flow like this and
water is in this one and it spreads out

240
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919

 

241
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,290

and yeah it will be a little bit more

242
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,300
and yeah it will be a little bit more
 

243
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,189
and yeah it will be a little bit more
tricky to do the wiring not really

244
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:40,199
tricky to do the wiring not really
 

245
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,949
tricky to do the wiring not really
tricky just us space consuming because

246
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:44,959
tricky just us space consuming because
 

247
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,239
tricky just us space consuming because
the pistons were really close together

248
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,249
the pistons were really close together
 

249
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,209
the pistons were really close together
before now they're far apart but I

250
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:50,219
before now they're far apart but I
 

251
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:55,850
before now they're far apart but I
figure these ones are all on the inside

252
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:55,860
figure these ones are all on the inside
 

253
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,439
figure these ones are all on the inside
so I'll have one why are you going to

254
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,449
so I'll have one why are you going to
 

255
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,990
so I'll have one why are you going to
the inside here

256
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000

 

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,159

and it will branch off Oh actually I

258
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:09,169
and it will branch off Oh actually I
 

259
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:16,240
and it will branch off Oh actually I
can't hmm maybe I'll just have a wire

260
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,250
can't hmm maybe I'll just have a wire
 

261
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,620
can't hmm maybe I'll just have a wire
going all the way around the outside

262
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,630
going all the way around the outside
 

263
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,710
going all the way around the outside
here I think that'll be easier so it

264
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:23,720
here I think that'll be easier so it
 

265
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,210
here I think that'll be easier so it
seems like I've made a little bit of a

266
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,220
seems like I've made a little bit of a
 

267
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,750
seems like I've made a little bit of a
mistake since my mom tower is smaller

268
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:28,760
mistake since my mom tower is smaller
 

269
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,490
mistake since my mom tower is smaller
now I have a new problem

270
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:32,500

 

271
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,769

this is where the wall should be now and

272
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:35,779
this is where the wall should be now and
 

273
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,680
this is where the wall should be now and
that's where I had this piston so that

274
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:38,690
that's where I had this piston so that
 

275
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,120
that's where I had this piston so that
won't fly but I have found a solution to

276
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,130
won't fly but I have found a solution to
 

277
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,710
won't fly but I have found a solution to
this what I am doing now I am putting

278
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:47,720
this what I am doing now I am putting
 

279
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:57,430
this what I am doing now I am putting
the sticky piston over here just

280
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
the sticky piston over here just
 

281
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,790
the sticky piston over here just
changing it slightly then removing this

282
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
changing it slightly then removing this
 

283
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:11,829
changing it slightly then removing this
one like that and then this is within

284
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
one like that and then this is within
 

285
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,900
one like that and then this is within
our boundary which is over here so

286
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:16,910
our boundary which is over here so
 

287
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,070
our boundary which is over here so
that'll work better and I think it'll be

288
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
that'll work better and I think it'll be
 

289
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,250
that'll work better and I think it'll be
easier to wire them with the lava piston

290
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,260
easier to wire them with the lava piston
 

291
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,640
easier to wire them with the lava piston
move to where it is now fairly certain

292
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,650
move to where it is now fairly certain
 

293
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:34,740
move to where it is now fairly certain
and the water still seems to flow okay

294
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:34,750

 

295
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,379

so that's good just a minor adjustment

296
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:39,389
so that's good just a minor adjustment
 

297
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,670
so that's good just a minor adjustment
but if people copy this I want to make

298
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
but if people copy this I want to make
 

299
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,119
but if people copy this I want to make
sure it all fits within the same size as

300
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:45,129
sure it all fits within the same size as
 

301
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,610
sure it all fits within the same size as
the spawning area below otherwise it's

302
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:47,620
the spawning area below otherwise it's
 

303
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,939
the spawning area below otherwise it's
very foolish if your top is fatter than

304
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:50,949
very foolish if your top is fatter than
 

305
00:09:50,949 --> 00:10:00,360
very foolish if your top is fatter than
the bottom parts awesome okay it's all

306
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,370
the bottom parts awesome okay it's all
 

307
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,819
the bottom parts awesome okay it's all
wired now it was actually really easy to

308
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:02,829
wired now it was actually really easy to
 

309
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,059
wired now it was actually really easy to
do much easier than before I moved that

310
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:06,069
do much easier than before I moved that
 

311
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:11,150
do much easier than before I moved that
lab a piston so this one here is for

312
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,160
lab a piston so this one here is for
 

313
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,790
lab a piston so this one here is for
lava turns all four on or off and this

314
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:17,800
lava turns all four on or off and this
 

315
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,590
lava turns all four on or off and this
that's wire going up to this repeater

316
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
that's wire going up to this repeater
 

317
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,230
that's wire going up to this repeater
repeater sends wire to yeah it's really

318
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,240
repeater sends wire to yeah it's really
 

319
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,030
repeater sends wire to yeah it's really
hard to see in here sorry - this thing

320
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
hard to see in here sorry - this thing
 

321
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,519
hard to see in here sorry - this thing
here and it branches off - all for lava

322
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:32,529
here and it branches off - all for lava
 

323
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,639
here and it branches off - all for lava
Pistons in a symmetrical design very

324
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:38,649
Pistons in a symmetrical design very
 

325
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:45,360
Pistons in a symmetrical design very
simple and then these ones control the

326
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,370
simple and then these ones control the
 

327
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:54,569
simple and then these ones control the
water and this just wraps around behind

328
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:54,579
water and this just wraps around behind
 

329
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,549
water and this just wraps around behind
this block here is our first water

330
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:56,559
this block here is our first water
 

331
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,429
this block here is our first water
piston I use a repeater here to send

332
00:10:59,429 --> 00:10:59,439
piston I use a repeater here to send
 

333
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,850
piston I use a repeater here to send
power into the block Jen gets sent to

334
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:02,860
power into the block Jen gets sent to
 

335
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,369
power into the block Jen gets sent to
the piston and also it sends it to the

336
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:05,379
the piston and also it sends it to the
 

337
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,920
the piston and also it sends it to the
wire on the other side here which

338
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:07,930
wire on the other side here which
 

339
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,249
wire on the other side here which
continues on to our next further water

340
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:11,259
continues on to our next further water
 

341
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,809
continues on to our next further water
piston and of course it extends the

342
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:15,819
piston and of course it extends the
 

343
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,340
piston and of course it extends the
signal otherwise this wire wouldn't make

344
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,350
signal otherwise this wire wouldn't make
 

345
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,509
signal otherwise this wire wouldn't make
it that far the power and same on the

346
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
it that far the power and same on the
 

347
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,720
it that far the power and same on the
side exact same thing

348
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:25,730

 

349
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,960

so it was fairly easy and yes it did fit

350
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:28,970
so it was fairly easy and yes it did fit
 

351
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,949
so it was fairly easy and yes it did fit
within my boundary here so it's perfect

352
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
within my boundary here so it's perfect
 

353
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,169
within my boundary here so it's perfect
and what I'll do next

354
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:35,179
and what I'll do next
 

355
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:41,049
and what I'll do next
is uh as I'll build my wall up to the

356
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:41,059
is uh as I'll build my wall up to the
 

357
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:44,229
is uh as I'll build my wall up to the
ceiling here and then all remove this

358
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:44,239
ceiling here and then all remove this
 

359
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,359
ceiling here and then all remove this
outer wall but I'll do that some other

360
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:46,369
outer wall but I'll do that some other
 

361
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:51,220
outer wall but I'll do that some other
time okay one other thing I should do in

362
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,230
time okay one other thing I should do in
 

363
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,669
time okay one other thing I should do in
here oh yeah by the way if I want I can

364
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:54,679
here oh yeah by the way if I want I can
 

365
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,900
here oh yeah by the way if I want I can
keep these two wires separate and what

366
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:58,910
keep these two wires separate and what
 

367
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,079
keep these two wires separate and what
that'll do is I'll be able to control

368
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:01,089
that'll do is I'll be able to control
 

369
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,210
that'll do is I'll be able to control
how many spiders I did like every water

370
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,220
how many spiders I did like every water
 

371
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,479
how many spiders I did like every water
column here that flows down decreases a

372
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:07,489
column here that flows down decreases a
 

373
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:10,710
column here that flows down decreases a
spider spawning a little bit so this

374
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
spider spawning a little bit so this
 

375
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,900
spider spawning a little bit so this
decreases by half if I I keep these

376
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:13,910
decreases by half if I I keep these
 

377
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,460
decreases by half if I I keep these
separate I'll probably join them

378
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,470
separate I'll probably join them
 

379
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,769
separate I'll probably join them
together but if I want I have that

380
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:17,779
together but if I want I have that
 

381
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,629
together but if I want I have that
option to where I can control the amount

382
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
option to where I can control the amount
 

383
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,299
option to where I can control the amount
of spiders not just simply turn it on or

384
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:22,309
of spiders not just simply turn it on or
 

385
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,449
of spiders not just simply turn it on or
off which could be cool but I don't

386
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:25,459
off which could be cool but I don't
 

387
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,109
off which could be cool but I don't
really care enough to bother and I need

388
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:29,119
really care enough to bother and I need
 

389
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:32,679
really care enough to bother and I need
to make this room mob proof so mobs can

390
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:32,689
to make this room mob proof so mobs can
 

391
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:36,929
to make this room mob proof so mobs can
spawn on top of redstone so I need to Oh

392
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:36,939
spawn on top of redstone so I need to Oh
 

393
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,759
spawn on top of redstone so I need to Oh
getting dizzy I need to make sure

394
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:39,769
getting dizzy I need to make sure
 

395
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:45,639
getting dizzy I need to make sure
there's no two air spaces or no air

396
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:45,649
there's no two air spaces or no air
 

397
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,460
there's no two air spaces or no air
space above the wire so I'll do that for

398
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,470
space above the wire so I'll do that for
 

399
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,239
space above the wire so I'll do that for
all these wires and it will be pretty

400
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:55,249
all these wires and it will be pretty
 

401
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:01,689
all these wires and it will be pretty
much ready here actually one thing else

402
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:01,699
much ready here actually one thing else
 

403
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,269
much ready here actually one thing else
I will comment about this I didn't

404
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:04,279
I will comment about this I didn't
 

405
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,769
I will comment about this I didn't
really think of when I was building this

406
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:05,779
really think of when I was building this
 

407
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,710
really think of when I was building this
but now that it's all done I'm really

408
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
but now that it's all done I'm really
 

409
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,479
but now that it's all done I'm really
glad it turned out this way this is the

410
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:13,489
glad it turned out this way this is the
 

411
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:17,499
glad it turned out this way this is the
top of the map right here's the cool

412
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:17,509
top of the map right here's the cool
 

413
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,569
top of the map right here's the cool
thing I was worried that mobs would

414
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:22,579
thing I was worried that mobs would
 

415
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:26,409
thing I was worried that mobs would
spawn on top here like I can't place any

416
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:26,419
spawn on top here like I can't place any
 

417
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,129
spawn on top here like I can't place any
more blocks at night because there would

418
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:30,139
more blocks at night because there would
 

419
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,499
more blocks at night because there would
be no light up here right but it turns

420
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:32,509
be no light up here right but it turns
 

421
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,629
be no light up here right but it turns
out mobs can't spawn at the top of the

422
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
out mobs can't spawn at the top of the
 

423
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,549
out mobs can't spawn at the top of the
map so that's something new I didn't

424
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:36,559
map so that's something new I didn't
 

425
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,810
map so that's something new I didn't
know before

426
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:37,820
know before
 

427
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,790
know before
and I don't have to worry about lighting

428
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:39,800
and I don't have to worry about lighting
 

429
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,410
and I don't have to worry about lighting
it up up here so that's cool

430
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:46,420

 

431
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,950

very nice

432
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:47,960
very nice
 

433
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,570
very nice
apparently snow does land here though

434
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:49,580
apparently snow does land here though
 

435
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,400
apparently snow does land here though
I'm surprised because you can't place a

436
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,410
I'm surprised because you can't place a
 

437
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:59,770
I'm surprised because you can't place a
block oh just about fell so I will

438
00:13:59,770 --> 00:13:59,780
block oh just about fell so I will
 

439
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,640
block oh just about fell so I will
finish this up

440
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,650
finish this up
 

441
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,650
finish this up
and we will move on to something else

442
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:04,660

 

443
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,450

okey so I finished up that wire room

444
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:07,460
okey so I finished up that wire room
 

445
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,140
okey so I finished up that wire room
it's all sealed off I made it smaller

446
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,150
it's all sealed off I made it smaller
 

447
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,390
it's all sealed off I made it smaller
completely darken it now so the lighting

448
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,400
completely darken it now so the lighting
 

449
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,190
completely darken it now so the lighting
the lighting won't interfere with the

450
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,200
the lighting won't interfere with the
 

451
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,800
the lighting won't interfere with the
layer below and it's working good again

452
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:19,810
layer below and it's working good again
 

453
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,870
layer below and it's working good again
so really happy with how this turned out

454
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
so really happy with how this turned out
 

455
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,610
so really happy with how this turned out
I still need to decide if I'm building

456
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:24,620
I still need to decide if I'm building
 

457
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,720
I still need to decide if I'm building
more than one of these towers I'm not

458
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,730
more than one of these towers I'm not
 

459
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,540
more than one of these towers I'm not
sure at the moment it's working really

460
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:31,550
sure at the moment it's working really
 

461
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,840
sure at the moment it's working really
good and I've been working at lighting

462
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:37,850
good and I've been working at lighting
 

463
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,850
good and I've been working at lighting
up more and more caves and every little

464
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:39,860
up more and more caves and every little
 

465
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,580
up more and more caves and every little
bit I light up seems to help a lot with

466
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,590
bit I light up seems to help a lot with
 

467
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,040
bit I light up seems to help a lot with
the spawning rate so I'm gonna try to

468
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,050
the spawning rate so I'm gonna try to
 

469
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,220
the spawning rate so I'm gonna try to
get them all and then see how this works

470
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,230
get them all and then see how this works
 

471
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,510
get them all and then see how this works
before I decide if I'm building more

472
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:49,520
before I decide if I'm building more
 

473
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:58,270
before I decide if I'm building more
than one and let's head over here the

474
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,280
than one and let's head over here the
 

475
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,180
than one and let's head over here the
way I'm lighting up the caves is by

476
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,190
way I'm lighting up the caves is by
 

477
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,910
way I'm lighting up the caves is by
something you all pointed to me last

478
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
something you all pointed to me last
 

479
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,720
something you all pointed to me last
episode a new development looks

580
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,230
seem to agree with them from what I've
 

581
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,030
seem to agree with them from what I've
seen but what happens is a mob will

582
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,040
seen but what happens is a mob will
 

583
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,300
seen but what happens is a mob will
spawn and then he'll walk away from you

584
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,310
spawn and then he'll walk away from you
 

585
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,950
spawn and then he'll walk away from you
lay a mob far away from you will spawn

586
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
lay a mob far away from you will spawn
 

587
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,290
lay a mob far away from you will spawn
and then walk away a certain distance

588
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,300
and then walk away a certain distance
 

589
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,430
and then walk away a certain distance
and then he seems to get stuck loaded in

590
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
and then he seems to get stuck loaded in
 

591
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,140
and then he seems to get stuck loaded in
memory and he won't despawn at all until

592
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,150
memory and he won't despawn at all until
 

593
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,460
memory and he won't despawn at all until
like when I experienced that glitch the

594
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,470
like when I experienced that glitch the
 

595
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,590
like when I experienced that glitch the
other day I walked up to this cliff here

596
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
other day I walked up to this cliff here
 

597
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,120
other day I walked up to this cliff here
and there's about 15 all 15 passive mobs

598
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,130
and there's about 15 all 15 passive mobs
 

599
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,610
and there's about 15 all 15 passive mobs
were here waiting for me and then I

600
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:44,620
were here waiting for me and then I
 

601
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,440
were here waiting for me and then I
walked away from it they'd be spawned

602
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,450
walked away from it they'd be spawned
 

603
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,210
walked away from it they'd be spawned
and then it was working again you can

604
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,220
and then it was working again you can
 

605
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,160
and then it was working again you can
also fix this by going to the nether as

606
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,170
also fix this by going to the nether as
 

607
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,500
also fix this by going to the nether as
many of you have pointed out because it

608
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,510
many of you have pointed out because it
 

609
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,470
many of you have pointed out because it
clears all loaded mobs from memory to

610
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
clears all loaded mobs from memory to
 

611
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,410
clears all loaded mobs from memory to
make room for the zombie pigmen it yes

612
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:03,420

 

613
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,370

so yeah if mob spawn with far distance

614
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:08,380
so yeah if mob spawn with far distance
 

615
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,500
so yeah if mob spawn with far distance
away from you and then walk even further

616
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,510
away from you and then walk even further
 

617
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,810
away from you and then walk even further
away they seem to somehow get stuck

618
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:12,820
away they seem to somehow get stuck
 

619
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,250
away they seem to somehow get stuck
loaded in memory and don't be spawned so

620
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,260
loaded in memory and don't be spawned so
 

621
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,870
loaded in memory and don't be spawned so
I thought the reason I wasn't really

622
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
I thought the reason I wasn't really
 

623
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,670
I thought the reason I wasn't really
experiencing that glitch was because I

624
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:20,680
experiencing that glitch was because I
 

625
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,510
experiencing that glitch was because I
built that mob system between four

626
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
built that mob system between four
 

627
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,710
built that mob system between four
region borders and many of you have been

628
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:31,720
region borders and many of you have been
 

629
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,390
region borders and many of you have been
wondering why I didn't build this one

630
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,400
wondering why I didn't build this one
 

631
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,030
wondering why I didn't build this one
between four region borders and it's

632
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,040
between four region borders and it's
 

633
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,950
between four region borders and it's
because that's not why I'm not

634
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:37,960
because that's not why I'm not
 

635
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,410
because that's not why I'm not
experiencing the glitch or not very

636
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:40,420
experiencing the glitch or not very
 

637
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,740
experiencing the glitch or not very
often it's because I have all this ice

638
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:43,750
often it's because I have all this ice
 

639
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,960
often it's because I have all this ice
around me it was just a coincidence

640
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:45,970
around me it was just a coincidence
 

641
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,140
around me it was just a coincidence
that's the ice that's preventing that

642
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,150
that's the ice that's preventing that
 

643
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,500
that's the ice that's preventing that
glitch because mobs do not spawn on ice

644
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,510
glitch because mobs do not spawn on ice
 

645
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,190
glitch because mobs do not spawn on ice
so if they can't spawn on ice they can't

646
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
so if they can't spawn on ice they can't
 

647
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,290
so if they can't spawn on ice they can't
wander further away and get stuck loaded

648
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:58,300
wander further away and get stuck loaded
 

649
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,660
wander further away and get stuck loaded
into memory is my understanding but you

650
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:03,670
into memory is my understanding but you
 

651
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,230
into memory is my understanding but you
can see if I'm standing here legit hours

652
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,240
can see if I'm standing here legit hours
 

653
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,320
can see if I'm standing here legit hours
at kornpett 493 let's walk over here

654
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,330
at kornpett 493 let's walk over here
 

655
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,500
at kornpett 493 let's walk over here
mobs can spawn as fur as far away as a

656
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:16,510
mobs can spawn as fur as far away as a
 

657
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,190
mobs can spawn as fur as far away as a
hundred four

658
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
hundred four
 

659
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,950
hundred four
four blocks from you okay so if we're at

660
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:19,960
four blocks from you okay so if we're at
 

661
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,180
four blocks from you okay so if we're at
493 there let's do a little bit of math

662
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,190
493 there let's do a little bit of math
 

663
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,100
493 there let's do a little bit of math
I got my tuck you later we're ready for

664
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,110
I got my tuck you later we're ready for
 

665
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,710
I got my tuck you later we're ready for
when we get there

666
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,720
when we get there
 

667
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:36,780
when we get there
my ti-83 oh yeah i stinking like got to

668
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:36,790
my ti-83 oh yeah i stinking like got to
 

669
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,760
my ti-83 oh yeah i stinking like got to
get rid of my ramdisk I know it's the

670
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:38,770
get rid of my ramdisk I know it's the
 

671
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,960
get rid of my ramdisk I know it's the
problem okay this is where the cliff was

672
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:42,970
problem okay this is where the cliff was
 

673
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,800
problem okay this is where the cliff was
before when I experienced that glitch we

674
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:46,810
before when I experienced that glitch we
 

675
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:57,780
before when I experienced that glitch we
are at Z 379 so 493 - 379 is 114 so

676
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:57,790
are at Z 379 so 493 - 379 is 114 so
 

677
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:04,800
are at Z 379 so 493 - 379 is 114 so
that's within 144 blocks which means it

678
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:04,810
that's within 144 blocks which means it
 

679
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,930
that's within 144 blocks which means it
is possible for me to experience that

680
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:06,940
is possible for me to experience that
 

681
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,580
is possible for me to experience that
glitch although very rare it is possible

682
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:11,590
glitch although very rare it is possible
 

683
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,630
glitch although very rare it is possible
because I'm within that 144 block range

684
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
because I'm within that 144 block range
 

685
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,190
because I'm within that 144 block range
same if I'm if I'm on the wall area

686
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
same if I'm if I'm on the wall area
 

687
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,740
same if I'm if I'm on the wall area
there it's still within that range so

688
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:19,750
there it's still within that range so
 

689
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,770
there it's still within that range so
that's why I think I experienced it for

690
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:22,780
that's why I think I experienced it for
 

691
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,010
that's why I think I experienced it for
the first time the other day so yeah I

692
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,020
the first time the other day so yeah I
 

693
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
the first time the other day so yeah I
don't know exactly all the details as to

694
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,030
don't know exactly all the details as to
 

695
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,710
don't know exactly all the details as to
how this glitch occurs it's merely my

696
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
how this glitch occurs it's merely my
 

697
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,810
how this glitch occurs it's merely my
opinion or speculation whatever you want

698
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:36,820
opinion or speculation whatever you want
 

699
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,390
opinion or speculation whatever you want
to call it but it most definitely is a

700
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,400
to call it but it most definitely is a
 

701
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,850
to call it but it most definitely is a
glitch the game doesn't seem to be able

702
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:41,860
glitch the game doesn't seem to be able
 

703
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,150
glitch the game doesn't seem to be able
to handle mobs properly when they walk

704
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,160
to handle mobs properly when they walk
 

705
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,880
to handle mobs properly when they walk
past a certain point a certain distance

706
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:47,890
past a certain point a certain distance
 

707
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,840
past a certain point a certain distance
I don't know what that distance is how

708
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:51,850
I don't know what that distance is how
 

709
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,460
I don't know what that distance is how
it occurs the weird thing is mops as far

710
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,470
it occurs the weird thing is mops as far
 

711
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,290
it occurs the weird thing is mops as far
as I know mobs despawn like within a

712
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:58,300
as I know mobs despawn like within a
 

713
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,680
as I know mobs despawn like within a
second if they're more than 128 blocks

714
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:01,690
second if they're more than 128 blocks
 

715
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,470
second if they're more than 128 blocks
away from you in a sphere sphere

716
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
away from you in a sphere sphere
 

717
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,020
away from you in a sphere sphere
distance so I don't know how it works

718
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,030
distance so I don't know how it works
 

719
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,920
distance so I don't know how it works
but one thing I do know for sure if I

720
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:13,930
but one thing I do know for sure if I
 

721
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,080
but one thing I do know for sure if I
clear this land up to about 350 or so I

722
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,090
clear this land up to about 350 or so I
 

723
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,750
clear this land up to about 350 or so I
will at all times be more than one

724
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
will at all times be more than one
 

725
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,400
will at all times be more than one
hundred and forty four blocks away from

726
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,410
hundred and forty four blocks away from
 

727
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,880
hundred and forty four blocks away from
any land which means no mobs will be

728
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:26,890
any land which means no mobs will be
 

729
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,370
any land which means no mobs will be
able to spawn I don't necessarily have

730
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:29,380
able to spawn I don't necessarily have
 

731
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,019
able to spawn I don't necessarily have
to clear

732
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:30,029
to clear
 

733
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,299
to clear
I just need to light it up and clear the

734
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:32,309
I just need to light it up and clear the
 

735
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,539
I just need to light it up and clear the
grass but I will probably blow it up

736
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:35,549
grass but I will probably blow it up
 

737
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,039
grass but I will probably blow it up
anyway but yeah I'll be more than 144

738
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:40,049
anyway but yeah I'll be more than 144
 

739
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,930
anyway but yeah I'll be more than 144
walks away they won't be able to spawn

740
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:41,940
walks away they won't be able to spawn
 

741
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,450
walks away they won't be able to spawn
and then wander away and get unloaded

742
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,460
and then wander away and get unloaded
 

743
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,359
and then wander away and get unloaded
improperly so I'm almost guaranteed sure

744
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:50,369
improperly so I'm almost guaranteed sure
 

745
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:56,560
improperly so I'm almost guaranteed sure
that will work but again it's my opinion

746
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,570

 

747
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,940

all right another thing I wanted to show

748
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:58,950
all right another thing I wanted to show
 

749
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,249
all right another thing I wanted to show
you was how to do that x-ray glitch how

750
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:01,259
you was how to do that x-ray glitch how
 

751
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,749
you was how to do that x-ray glitch how
to set it up again I did not discover

752
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:05,759
to set it up again I did not discover
 

753
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,909
to set it up again I did not discover
this trick someone nearly showed it to

754
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
this trick someone nearly showed it to
 

755
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,909
this trick someone nearly showed it to
me if I can find the link given to me

756
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:10,919
me if I can find the link given to me
 

757
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,799
me if I can find the link given to me
for the original video I will link it in

758
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:12,809
for the original video I will link it in
 

759
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,359
for the original video I will link it in
the description but I'm pretty sure I

760
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:17,369
the description but I'm pretty sure I
 

761
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,889
the description but I'm pretty sure I
lost it so this is how I set mine up I

762
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:21,899
lost it so this is how I set mine up I
 

763
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:27,769
lost it so this is how I set mine up I
cleared this area here and I use sticky

764
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:27,779
cleared this area here and I use sticky
 

765
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:37,190
cleared this area here and I use sticky
pistons - away from you yeah and let's

766
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
pistons - away from you yeah and let's
 

767
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,269
pistons - away from you yeah and let's
see the wire comes down there runs over

768
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
see the wire comes down there runs over
 

769
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:49,579
see the wire comes down there runs over
here I'm taking a roundabout way with

770
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:49,589
here I'm taking a roundabout way with
 

771
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:52,419
here I'm taking a roundabout way with
the wire just to maximize your viewing

772
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:52,429
the wire just to maximize your viewing
 

773
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,209
the wire just to maximize your viewing
angle with this thing wait was that

774
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:56,219
angle with this thing wait was that
 

775
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:59,629
angle with this thing wait was that
where it was I think it was over my

776
00:23:59,629 --> 00:23:59,639
where it was I think it was over my
 

777
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:05,180
where it was I think it was over my
redstone I think I had the lever like

778
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,190
redstone I think I had the lever like
 

779
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:12,019
redstone I think I had the lever like
this yeah so power is the wire over over

780
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:12,029
this yeah so power is the wire over over
 

781
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,249
this yeah so power is the wire over over
here it wraps around points directly to

782
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:16,259
here it wraps around points directly to
 

783
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,639
here it wraps around points directly to
the two Pistons if you don't want mobs

784
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:19,649
the two Pistons if you don't want mobs
 

785
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,659
the two Pistons if you don't want mobs
to spawn put in a half slab or something

786
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:22,669
to spawn put in a half slab or something
 

787
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:29,989
to spawn put in a half slab or something
paste in a piston and cover this up and

788
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:29,999
paste in a piston and cover this up and
 

789
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,829
paste in a piston and cover this up and
sticking your TNT I tried glass I tried

790
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:33,839
sticking your TNT I tried glass I tried
 

791
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,049
sticking your TNT I tried glass I tried
leaves and a few other things tangent is

792
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:36,059
leaves and a few other things tangent is
 

793
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,889
leaves and a few other things tangent is
