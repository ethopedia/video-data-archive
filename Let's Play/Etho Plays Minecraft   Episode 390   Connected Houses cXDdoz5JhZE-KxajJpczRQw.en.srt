00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
set up the path so that's what these
 

111
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,749

um so we're going to go through the

130
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
um so we're going to go through the
 

131
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,869
um so we're going to go through the
reeds here i think we'll bulldoze some

132
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
reeds here i think we'll bulldoze some
 

133
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,550
reeds here i think we'll bulldoze some
of these reeds

134
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
of these reeds
 

135
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,470
of these reeds
make the path go through here a little

136
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
make the path go through here a little
 

137
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,430
make the path go through here a little
ways and it should connect

138
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
ways and it should connect
 

139
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,750
ways and it should connect
it's actually pretty far still but we're

140
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
it's actually pretty far still but we're
 

141
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,030
it's actually pretty far still but we're
going to try to connect it up to this

142
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
going to try to connect it up to this
 

143
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,750
going to try to connect it up to this
path

144
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
path
 

145
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,750
path
and like create more unity in our world

146
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
and like create more unity in our world
 

147

here because that'll connect
 

149
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,589
here because that'll connect
the sand village all the way up to the

150
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
the sand village all the way up to the
 

151
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,509
the sand village all the way up to the
windmill pretty much

152
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
windmill pretty much
 

153
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,869
windmill pretty much
and then we are also going to let's head

154
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
and then we are also going to let's head
 

155
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,190
and then we are also going to let's head
back

156
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
back
 

157
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,630
back
quickly all right all right so then

158
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
quickly all right all right so then
 

159
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,830
quickly all right all right so then
this torch path also goes

160
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
this torch path also goes
 

161
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,030
this torch path also goes
up and this way over to here and this

162
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
up and this way over to here and this
 

163
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,869
up and this way over to here and this
will take us right to the man cave so

164
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
will take us right to the man cave so
 

165
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,110
will take us right to the man cave so
it'll actually connect our man cave

166
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
it'll actually connect our man cave
 

167
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,430
it'll actually connect our man cave
to like that windmill area and stuff

168

to like that windmill area and stuff
 

169
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,710
to like that windmill area and stuff
properly which is cool um

170
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
properly which is cool um
 

171
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,229
properly which is cool um
then we got a couple other brand

172
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
then we got a couple other brand
 

173
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,910
then we got a couple other brand
branches going here one of them is going

174
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
branches going here one of them is going
 

175
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,350
branches going here one of them is going
to go to the pyramid

176
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360

 

177
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,790

uh yeah over here over this way and then

178
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
uh yeah over here over this way and then
 

179
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,550
uh yeah over here over this way and then
the rest of it is kind of spread out

180
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
the rest of it is kind of spread out
 

181
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,830
the rest of it is kind of spread out
sort of evenly so this is like the

182
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
sort of evenly so this is like the
 

183
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,070
sort of evenly so this is like the
main intersection i think here and

184
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
main intersection i think here and
 

185
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,630
main intersection i think here and
kind of an intersection here too i guess

186
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
kind of an intersection here too i guess
 

187
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,910
kind of an intersection here too i guess
all right

188
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
all right
 

189
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,470
all right
so what to use for the path is the next

190
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
so what to use for the path is the next
 

191
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,430
so what to use for the path is the next
question i've been trying to decide

192
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
question i've been trying to decide
 

193
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,070
question i've been trying to decide
i kind of want to use something brown i

194
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
i kind of want to use something brown i
 

195
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,830
i kind of want to use something brown i
think dirt would look pretty good but it

196
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
think dirt would look pretty good but it
 

197
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,350
think dirt would look pretty good but it
doesn't make sense right because we're

198
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
doesn't make sense right because we're
 

199
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,110
doesn't make sense right because we're
in the desert there's sand

200
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
in the desert there's sand
 

201
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,710
in the desert there's sand
where did the dirt come from um

202
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
where did the dirt come from um
 

203
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,229
where did the dirt come from um
oh yeah i brought mushroom blocks too i

204
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
oh yeah i brought mushroom blocks too i
 

205
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,149
oh yeah i brought mushroom blocks too i
wanted to try these

206
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
wanted to try these
 

207
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,750
wanted to try these
at the end where did the mushroom blocks

208
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
at the end where did the mushroom blocks
 

209
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,949
at the end where did the mushroom blocks
come from i think i'm going to have that

210
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
come from i think i'm going to have that
 

211
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,070
come from i think i'm going to have that
problem with everything

212
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080

 

213
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,030

um i want to use these more but i don't

214
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
um i want to use these more but i don't
 

215
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,830
um i want to use these more but i don't
know if they really worked as a passing

216
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
know if they really worked as a passing
 

217
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,390
know if they really worked as a passing
material

218
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
material
 

219
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,869
material
wood though also has that problem

220
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
wood though also has that problem
 

221
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,149
wood though also has that problem
because it's like where did the trees

222
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
because it's like where did the trees
 

223
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,309
because it's like where did the trees
come from we're in the desert

224
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
come from we're in the desert
 

225
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,030
come from we're in the desert
what what can we use we got to decide on

226
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
what what can we use we got to decide on
 

227
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,910
what what can we use we got to decide on
something

228
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
something
 

229
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,869
something
spruce wood looks pretty good though but

230
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
spruce wood looks pretty good though but
 

231
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,429
spruce wood looks pretty good though but
we could also try actia

232
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
we could also try actia
 

233
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,670
we could also try actia
but anyway i'm not gonna waste too much

234
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
but anyway i'm not gonna waste too much
 

235
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,949
but anyway i'm not gonna waste too much
time with this i'll try to figure it out

236
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
time with this i'll try to figure it out
 

237
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,150
time with this i'll try to figure it out
off camera

238
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
off camera
 

239
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,909
off camera
so i'm gonna lay out the paths and then

240
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
so i'm gonna lay out the paths and then
 

241
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,990
so i'm gonna lay out the paths and then
we gotta lay out the foundation for the

242
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
we gotta lay out the foundation for the
 

243
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
we gotta lay out the foundation for the
houses

244
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
houses
 

245
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,270
houses
and then build them up the basic shape

246
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
and then build them up the basic shape
 

247
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,790
and then build them up the basic shape
and then we got to go and add detail to

248
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
and then we got to go and add detail to
 

249
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,629
and then we got to go and add detail to
them all that's sort of the process i'm

250
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
them all that's sort of the process i'm
 

251
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,110
them all that's sort of the process i'm
going to take with this

252
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
going to take with this
 

253
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,030
going to take with this
all right everybody so check it out i

254
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
all right everybody so check it out i
 

255
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,270
all right everybody so check it out i
decided to go with birchwood planks for

256
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
decided to go with birchwood planks for
 

257
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,550
decided to go with birchwood planks for
our path here it's

258
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
our path here it's
 

259
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,950
our path here it's
kind of a subtle block it very similar

260
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
kind of a subtle block it very similar
 

261
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,469
kind of a subtle block it very similar
to sand texture

262
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
to sand texture
 

263
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,710
to sand texture
um i'm not going to keep it solid like

264
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
um i'm not going to keep it solid like
 

265
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,909
um i'm not going to keep it solid like
this so don't you worry

266
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
this so don't you worry
 

267
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,590
this so don't you worry
no what you do or what i do

268
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
no what you do or what i do
 

269
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,950
no what you do or what i do
i lay out the main main block i want to

270
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
i lay out the main main block i want to
 

271
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,469
i lay out the main main block i want to
use for the path and then i go

272
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
use for the path and then i go
 

273
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,749
use for the path and then i go
and and like break it up and we'll mix

274
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
and and like break it up and we'll mix
 

275
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,749
and and like break it up and we'll mix
in some sand again

276
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
in some sand again
 

277
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,990
in some sand again
and then maybe some sand stone maybe one

278
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
and then maybe some sand stone maybe one
 

279
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,350
and then maybe some sand stone maybe one
other type of block

280
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
other type of block
 

281
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,590
other type of block
and it should make it look pretty nice i

282
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
and it should make it look pretty nice i
 

283
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,110
and it should make it look pretty nice i
think

284
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
think
 

285
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,070
think
um but that's sort of the method i go

286
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
um but that's sort of the method i go
 

287
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,710
um but that's sort of the method i go
with this

288
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
with this
 

289
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,790
with this
look how easy this is by the way like to

290
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
look how easy this is by the way like to
 

291
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,830
look how easy this is by the way like to
make the path

292
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
make the path
 

293
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,870
make the path
making organic paths is something i used

294
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
making organic paths is something i used
 

295
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,189
making organic paths is something i used
to struggle with quite a bit

296
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
to struggle with quite a bit
 

297
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,390
to struggle with quite a bit
but it's just like connect the dots

298
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
but it's just like connect the dots
 

299
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,950
but it's just like connect the dots
you just go out next torch is there all

300
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
you just go out next torch is there all
 

301
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,710
you just go out next torch is there all
right

302
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
right
 

303
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,260
right
and next one's up over here

304
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,270
and next one's up over here
 

305
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,550

[Applause]
 

307
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,270
[Applause]
and you just kind of go along pretty

308
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
and you just kind of go along pretty
 

309
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,950
and you just kind of go along pretty
simple

310
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
simple
 

311
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,950
simple
it only is like one block wide at the

312
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
it only is like one block wide at the
 

313
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,230
it only is like one block wide at the
start and then you go through and you

314
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
start and then you go through and you
 

315
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,510
start and then you go through and you
widen it

316
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
widen it
 

317
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,310
widen it
however much you want and it ends up

318
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
however much you want and it ends up
 

319
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,950
however much you want and it ends up
looking pretty good usually

320
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
looking pretty good usually
 

321
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,710
looking pretty good usually
this is what i did when i made the horse

322
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
this is what i did when i made the horse
 

323
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,950
this is what i did when i made the horse
track anyway and i was pretty happy with

324
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
track anyway and i was pretty happy with
 

325
00:05:48,960 --> 00:06:12,469
track anyway and i was pretty happy with
the result

326
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479

 

327
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,510

aha there we go guys we got the paths in

328
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
aha there we go guys we got the paths in
 

329
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,550
aha there we go guys we got the paths in
for a pretty big portion of this already

330
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
for a pretty big portion of this already

doesn't go out past there yet but uh

332
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
doesn't go out past there yet but uh
 

333
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,790
doesn't go out past there yet but uh
yeah look at this

334
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
yeah look at this
 

335
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,670
yeah look at this
i'm pretty happy with that it looks

336
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
i'm pretty happy with that it looks
 

337
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,710
i'm pretty happy with that it looks
really chaotic

338
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
really chaotic
 

339
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,110
really chaotic
now because you're comparing it with

340
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
now because you're comparing it with
 

341
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,510
now because you're comparing it with
like the super consistent sand

342
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
like the super consistent sand
 

343
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,110
like the super consistent sand
that it's next to once we actually get

344
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
that it's next to once we actually get
 

345
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,710
that it's next to once we actually get
the village in though and there's lots

346
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
the village in though and there's lots
 

347
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,670
the village in though and there's lots
of

348
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
of
 

349
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,309
of
like detail it's not gonna look quite as

350
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
like detail it's not gonna look quite as
 

351
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,430
like detail it's not gonna look quite as
crazy

352
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
crazy
 

353
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,670
crazy
uh i did try something as well i tried

354
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
uh i did try something as well i tried
 

355
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,430
uh i did try something as well i tried
to mix in some darker colors

356
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
to mix in some darker colors
 

357
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,029
to mix in some darker colors
like oakwood let's just experiment with

358
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
like oakwood let's just experiment with
 

359
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,629
like oakwood let's just experiment with
this once more

360
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
this once more
 

361
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,790
this once more
uh but i thought it looked just a little

362
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
uh but i thought it looked just a little
 

363
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,189
uh but i thought it looked just a little
bit too crazy a little too much going on

364
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
bit too crazy a little too much going on
 

365
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,070
bit too crazy a little too much going on
then

366
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
then
 

367
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,749
then
but we'll just do a small sample here so

368
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
but we'll just do a small sample here so
 

369
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,110
but we'll just do a small sample here so
you can get the idea

370
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120

 

371
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,230

all right yeah if we do it like that

372
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
all right yeah if we do it like that
 

373
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,629
all right yeah if we do it like that
maybe it would look good but i think

374
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
maybe it would look good but i think
 

375
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,990
maybe it would look good but i think
it's just

376
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
it's just
 

377
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,309
it's just
drawing too much attention it's the path

378
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
drawing too much attention it's the path
 

379
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,749
drawing too much attention it's the path
it's not what you're supposed to look at

380
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
it's not what you're supposed to look at
 

381
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,270
it's not what you're supposed to look at
right

382
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
right
 

383
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,990
right
okay so anyway we are going to move on

384
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
okay so anyway we are going to move on
 

385
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,510
okay so anyway we are going to move on
to the building now

386
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
to the building now
 

387
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,309
to the building now
the structures oh yeah by the way if you

388
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
the structures oh yeah by the way if you
 

389
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,070
the structures oh yeah by the way if you
haven't been keeping up with mojang

390
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
haven't been keeping up with mojang
 

391
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,390
haven't been keeping up with mojang
they have been tweeting a lot they're

392
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
they have been tweeting a lot they're
 

393
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,390
they have been tweeting a lot they're
working on the 1.9 update

394
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
working on the 1.9 update
 

395
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,110
working on the 1.9 update
now and uh well maybe they have been for

396
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
now and uh well maybe they have been for
 

397
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,550
now and uh well maybe they have been for
a while i don't know but now they're

398
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
a while i don't know but now they're
 

399
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,870
a while i don't know but now they're
like

400
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
like
 

401
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,550
like
giving information about features and

402
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
giving information about features and
 

403
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,909
giving information about features and
stuff and one of the things they're

404
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
stuff and one of the things they're
 

405
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,909
stuff and one of the things they're
adding is a new

406
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
adding is a new
 

407
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,189
adding is a new
sandy well it's like a path block

408
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
sandy well it's like a path block
 

409
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,430
sandy well it's like a path block
is what they're calling it i think it's

410
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
is what they're calling it i think it's
 

411
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,870
is what they're calling it i think it's
like a mix between

412
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
like a mix between
 

413
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,710
like a mix between
dirt and sand color which probably would

414
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
dirt and sand color which probably would
 

415
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,189
dirt and sand color which probably would
have been perfect for this

416
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
have been perfect for this
 

417
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,469
have been perfect for this
but uh oh well i decided just to go

418
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
but uh oh well i decided just to go
 

419
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,469
but uh oh well i decided just to go
ahead and use this because it's not out

420
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
ahead and use this because it's not out
 

421
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,589
ahead and use this because it's not out
yet

422
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
yet
 

423
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,629
yet
but also there's gonna be some

424
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
but also there's gonna be some
 

425
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,710
but also there's gonna be some
new crops i think jeb said he's making

426
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
new crops i think jeb said he's making
 

427
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,390
new crops i think jeb said he's making
corn and

428
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
corn and
 

429
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,150
corn and
dinner bone has been working on some

430
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
dinner bone has been working on some
 

431
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,510
dinner bone has been working on some
wither stuff

432
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
wither stuff
 

433
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,230
wither stuff
so pretty exciting can't wait to see

434
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
so pretty exciting can't wait to see
 

435
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,990
so pretty exciting can't wait to see
what's going on

436
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
what's going on
 

437
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,749
what's going on
um anyway i looked at some pictures like

438
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
um anyway i looked at some pictures like
 

439
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,790
um anyway i looked at some pictures like
some real life pictures of

440
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
some real life pictures of
 

441
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,029
some real life pictures of
desert villages to get some inspiration

442
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
desert villages to get some inspiration
 

443
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,790
desert villages to get some inspiration
and got some

444
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
and got some
 

445
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,510
and got some
some pretty good ideas one thing i saw

446
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
some pretty good ideas one thing i saw
 

447
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,670
some pretty good ideas one thing i saw
is they like connected all the

448
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
is they like connected all the
 

449
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,390
is they like connected all the
sand buildings together like they were

450
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
sand buildings together like they were
 

451
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,990
sand buildings together like they were
basic little shapes like this

452
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
basic little shapes like this
 

453
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,510
basic little shapes like this
but then they were all kind of connected

454
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
but then they were all kind of connected
 

455
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,070
but then they were all kind of connected
together which i might want to try

456
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
together which i might want to try
 

457
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,829
together which i might want to try
let's see so let's pick a side that

458
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
let's see so let's pick a side that
 

459
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,430
let's see so let's pick a side that
doesn't really have much to it like

460
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
doesn't really have much to it like
 

461
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,389
doesn't really have much to it like
maybe

462
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
maybe
 

463
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,269
maybe
maybe we'll do like here

464
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279

 

465
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,509

here and here so we would do

466
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
here and here so we would do
 

467
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,030
here and here so we would do
like another square connecting to this

468
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
like another square connecting to this
 

469
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,630
like another square connecting to this
building so they're kind of part of each

470
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
building so they're kind of part of each
 

471
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,790
building so they're kind of part of each
other still

472
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
other still
 

473
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,190
other still
and we would we would cut this part off

474
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
and we would we would cut this part off
 

475
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,430
and we would we would cut this part off
like these little fences and stuff

476
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
like these little fences and stuff
 

477
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,030
like these little fences and stuff
and we'd have another building here and

478
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
and we'd have another building here and
 

479
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,190
and we'd have another building here and
then maybe another one

480
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
then maybe another one
 

481
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,350
then maybe another one
over here

482
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360

 

483
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,110

like this um

484
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120

 

485
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,070

yeah just trying to think of interesting

486
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
yeah just trying to think of interesting
 

487
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,350
yeah just trying to think of interesting
shapes to this

488
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
shapes to this
 

489
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,430
shapes to this
could do it like this and then here

490
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
could do it like this and then here
 

491
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,190
could do it like this and then here
perhaps

492
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
perhaps
 

493
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,670
perhaps
that would leave a little empty space in

494
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
that would leave a little empty space in
 

495
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,870
that would leave a little empty space in
the middle

496
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
the middle
 

497
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,230
the middle
i don't know stuff like that but

498
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
i don't know stuff like that but
 

499
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,829
i don't know stuff like that but
basically we got to fill in all the

500
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
basically we got to fill in all the
 

501
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,389
basically we got to fill in all the
space between the paths now

502
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399

where i'm getting at with this
 

669
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,790
where i'm getting at with this
so yeah i don't know if i can keep it up

670
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
so yeah i don't know if i can keep it up
 

671
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,910
so yeah i don't know if i can keep it up
for very much

672
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
for very much
 

673
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,110
for very much
longer because i am so tired now like

674
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
longer because i am so tired now like
 

675
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,629
longer because i am so tired now like
so so tired

676
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639

 

677
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,430

um but it did kind of work i just i

678
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
um but it did kind of work i just i
 

679
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,949
um but it did kind of work i just i
don't understand why i can't sleep

680
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
don't understand why i can't sleep
 

681
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,310
don't understand why i can't sleep
deeply anymore

682
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
deeply anymore
 

683
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,190
deeply anymore
because i am tired but i keep waking up

684
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
because i am tired but i keep waking up
 

685
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,590
because i am tired but i keep waking up
at the

686
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
at the
 

687
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,590
at the
in the middle of night it's stupid even

688
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
in the middle of night it's stupid even
 

689
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,269
in the middle of night it's stupid even
though i should be super tired and

690
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
though i should be super tired and
 

691
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,389
though i should be super tired and
sleeping deeply but just the change has

692
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
sleeping deeply but just the change has
 

693
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,150
sleeping deeply but just the change has
messed me up a little bit i guess

694
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160

 

695
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,230

anyway here is the result of what we

696
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
anyway here is the result of what we
 

697
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,269
anyway here is the result of what we
just did

698
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
just did
 

699
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,550
just did
let's take a little loop around the

700
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
let's take a little loop around the
 

701
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,310
let's take a little loop around the
building and get an idea

702
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
building and get an idea
 

703
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,110
building and get an idea
so this is a basic shape now the next

704
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
so this is a basic shape now the next
 

705
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,590
so this is a basic shape now the next
step is to add the detail right

706
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
step is to add the detail right
 

707
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,110
step is to add the detail right
i'm pretty happy with this though i

708
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
i'm pretty happy with this though i
 

709
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,949
i'm pretty happy with this though i
think it turned out pretty cool

710
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
think it turned out pretty cool
 

711
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,790
think it turned out pretty cool
i like it i like it we didn't really

712
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
i like it i like it we didn't really
 

713
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,230
i like it i like it we didn't really
wreck this building either it still

714
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
wreck this building either it still
 

715
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,350
wreck this building either it still
looks the same right

716
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
looks the same right
 

717
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,870
looks the same right
this is the most important view over

718
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
this is the most important view over
 

719
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,590
this is the most important view over
here now when we go up to

720
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
here now when we go up to
 

721
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,710
here now when we go up to
the top here the second or this roof

722
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
the top here the second or this roof
 

723
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,190
the top here the second or this roof
axis

724
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
axis
 

725
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,790
axis
actually makes a little bit more sense

726
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
actually makes a little bit more sense
 

727
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,230
actually makes a little bit more sense
because we can

728
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
because we can
 

729
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,990
because we can
for example start connecting these

730
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
for example start connecting these
 

731
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,949
for example start connecting these
together at the roof too

732
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
together at the roof too
 

733
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,590
together at the roof too
going to turn this into spruce over here

734
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600

 

735
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,509

like so they kind of connect together

736
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
like so they kind of connect together
 

737
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,269
like so they kind of connect together
that way and we probably even want to

738
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
that way and we probably even want to
 

739
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,670
that way and we probably even want to
have

740
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
have
 

741
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,550
have
a bit of a second floor to this building

742
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
a bit of a second floor to this building
 

743
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,590
a bit of a second floor to this building
so we may

744
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
so we may
 

745
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,230
so we may
like put another one of these rectangles

746
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
like put another one of these rectangles
 

747
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,030
like put another one of these rectangles
running across

748
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
running across
 

749
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,150
running across
like this

750
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160

 

751
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,910

and just have a couple of them up here

752
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
and just have a couple of them up here
 

753
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,230
and just have a couple of them up here
not totally solid or anything not like a

754
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
not totally solid or anything not like a
 

755
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,829
not totally solid or anything not like a
full second floor

756
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
full second floor
 

757
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,110
full second floor
but just in places i think would be cool

758
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
but just in places i think would be cool
 

759
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,710
but just in places i think would be cool
and you'll notice the way i laid this

760
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
and you'll notice the way i laid this
 

761
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,030
and you'll notice the way i laid this
out this is pretty important

762
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
out this is pretty important
 

763
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,430
out this is pretty important
not many of these walls actually line up

764
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
not many of these walls actually line up
 

765
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,189
not many of these walls actually line up
like this wall does not line up with

766
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
like this wall does not line up with
 

767
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,949
like this wall does not line up with
that one there

768
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
that one there
 

769
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,509
that one there
it's i did that so that it's sort of

770
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
it's i did that so that it's sort of
 

771
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,230
it's i did that so that it's sort of
more interesting to look at same with

772
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
more interesting to look at same with
 

773
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,790
more interesting to look at same with
this one

774
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
this one
 

775
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,710
this one
this one was over there and i just moved

776
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
this one was over there and i just moved
 

777
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,310
this one was over there and i just moved
it back one block

778
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
it back one block
 

779
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,910
it back one block
because i don't want them to line up it

780
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
because i don't want them to line up it
 

781
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,910
because i don't want them to line up it
looks more organic

782
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
looks more organic
 

783
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,430
looks more organic
if they don't um also none of these

784
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
if they don't um also none of these
 

785
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,710
if they don't um also none of these
posts are visible from

786
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
posts are visible from
 

787
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,269
posts are visible from
inside the building which is kind of

788
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
inside the building which is kind of
 

789
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,389
inside the building which is kind of
nice it worked out that way

790
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
nice it worked out that way
 

791
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,069
nice it worked out that way
so yeah let me get a little bit more

792
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
so yeah let me get a little bit more
 

793
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,110
so yeah let me get a little bit more
done here and

794
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
done here and
 

795
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,590
done here and
then maybe we'll add some detail or go

796
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
then maybe we'll add some detail or go
 

797
00:14:41,600 --> 00:15:09,990
then maybe we'll add some detail or go
do something else i'm not sure

798
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000

 

799
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,829

ice cube break

800
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839

 

801
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,870

oh oh do i dare

802
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
oh oh do i dare
 

803
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,030
oh oh do i dare
oh i got him oh that's always risky

804
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
oh i got him oh that's always risky
 

805
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,870
oh i got him oh that's always risky
alright so guys i've been building like

806
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
alright so guys i've been building like
 

807
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,629
alright so guys i've been building like
a madman here

808
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
a madman here
 

809
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,670
a madman here
i got quite a bit done

810
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
i got quite a bit done
 

811
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,550
i got quite a bit done
but not quite finished still need to add

812
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
but not quite finished still need to add
 

813
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,790
but not quite finished still need to add
more detail more polish to it but

814
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
more detail more polish to it but
 

815
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,030
more detail more polish to it but
i think it's going pretty good i'm very

816
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
i think it's going pretty good i'm very
 

817
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,710
i think it's going pretty good i'm very
low on recording time though now this is

818
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
low on recording time though now this is
 

819
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,470
low on recording time though now this is
taking a few hours

820
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
taking a few hours
 

821
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,150
taking a few hours
it always seems so simple and then when

822
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
it always seems so simple and then when
 

823
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,310
it always seems so simple and then when
you get to it it's like oh yeah there's

824
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
you get to it it's like oh yeah there's
 

825
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,069
you get to it it's like oh yeah there's
there's actually a lot to this project

826
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
there's actually a lot to this project
 

827
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,990
there's actually a lot to this project
lots of blocks to place

828
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
lots of blocks to place
 

829
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,310
lots of blocks to place
but uh pretty happy with the results so

830
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
but uh pretty happy with the results so
 

831
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,430
but uh pretty happy with the results so
far

832
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
far
 

833
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,110
far
so yeah let's just take quick a quick

834
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
so yeah let's just take quick a quick
 

835
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,710
so yeah let's just take quick a quick
look around here this is the second

on this building so i i just punched a
 

853
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,829
on this building so i i just punched a
hole in the wall

854
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
hole in the wall
 

855
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,790
hole in the wall
just now um but this one we gotta weigh

856
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
just now um but this one we gotta weigh
 

857
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,910
just now um but this one we gotta weigh
in

858
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
in
 

859
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,230
in
got sandstone slabs for the floor i'll

860
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
got sandstone slabs for the floor i'll
 

861
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,629
got sandstone slabs for the floor i'll
probably mix in some wood slabs

862
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
probably mix in some wood slabs
 

863
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,150
probably mix in some wood slabs
and yeah that's that's basically it so i

864
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
and yeah that's that's basically it so i
 

865
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,470
and yeah that's that's basically it so i
left all this space in the front here

866
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
left all this space in the front here
 

867
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,470
left all this space in the front here
so that we could add some outside

so that we could add some outside
 

869
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,069
so that we could add some outside
details to the building as well i want

more buildings done like on this side of

882
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
more buildings done like on this side of
 

883
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,030
more buildings done like on this side of
the road and

884
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
the road and
 

885
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,269
the road and
and like up over here it's got a good

886

and like up over here it's got a good
 

887
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,150
and like up over here it's got a good
height

888
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
height
 

889
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,069
height
to the building i would say feels like a

890
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
to the building i would say feels like a
 

891
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,189
to the building i would say feels like a
a good city i guess it's not taller than

as well you don't want it taller than
 

897
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,310
as well you don't want it taller than
your most important structure
