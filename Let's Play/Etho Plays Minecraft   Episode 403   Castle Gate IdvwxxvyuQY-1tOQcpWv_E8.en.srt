so from what i've found out so far like

70
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
so from what i've found out so far like
 

71
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,070
so from what i've found out so far like
i'm still in the middle of practicing

72
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
i'm still in the middle of practicing
 

73
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,270
i'm still in the middle of practicing
but basically

74
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
but basically
 

75
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,749
but basically
you want to hold forward you want to

76
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
you want to hold forward you want to
 

77
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,429
you want to hold forward you want to
have it at about

78
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
have it at about
 

79
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,429
have it at about
what is it about negative 15 or so

80
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
what is it about negative 15 or so
 

81
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,510
what is it about negative 15 or so
you see the number over over about here

82
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
you see the number over over about here
 

83
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,870
you see the number over over about here
on the screen

84
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
on the screen
 

85
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,069
on the screen
you want that about negative 15 to 25

86
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
you want that about negative 15 to 25
 

87
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,190
you want that about negative 15 to 25
maybe ideally and you

88
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
maybe ideally and you
 

89
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,230
maybe ideally and you
pull the bow back if you just tap it it

90
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
pull the bow back if you just tap it it
 

91
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,670
pull the bow back if you just tap it it
does this it doesn't actually shoot the

does this it doesn't actually shoot the
 

93
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,749
does this it doesn't actually shoot the
arrow so you have to hold it for

94
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
arrow so you have to hold it for
 

95
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,350
arrow so you have to hold it for
about a second oh man it's going to get

96
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
about a second oh man it's going to get
 

97
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,870
about a second oh man it's going to get
night time

00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
night time
 

99
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,630
night time
hold it for about a second and then

100
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
hold it for about a second and then
 

101
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,469

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
to jump you just want to give it a
 

105
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,070
to jump you just want to give it a
little jump so you jump into the arrow

106
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
little jump so you jump into the arrow
 

107
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,949
little jump so you jump into the arrow
kind of

108
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
kind of
 

109
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,270
kind of
uh if you are on the ground when it hits

110
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
uh if you are on the ground when it hits
 

111
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,390
uh if you are on the ground when it hits
you it doesn't

112
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
you it doesn't
 

113
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,270
you it doesn't
boost you quite as much here i won't

114

jump this time
 

117
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,670
jump this time
let's see if i can do it oh man i'm bad

118
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
let's see if i can do it oh man i'm bad
 

119
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,470
let's see if i can do it oh man i'm bad
at it

120
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
at it
 

121
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,070

boost nothing crazy but if you jump
 

125
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,630
boost nothing crazy but if you jump
you don't like get as much friction or

126
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
you don't like get as much friction or
 

127
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,110
you don't like get as much friction or
something and you go quite a bit farther

128
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
something and you go quite a bit farther
 

129
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,589
something and you go quite a bit farther
i think

137
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,110
aha but the other really cool thing with
this is you can double jump i did it

that might have been a double jump i
 

143
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,270
that might have been a double jump i
might have hit the ground there though i

00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
all right practical application time we
 

179
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,990
all right practical application time we
can use it sort of like a

right it's probably not very practical

192
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
right it's probably not very practical
 

193
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,990
right it's probably not very practical
actually

194
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000

it's fun
it's actually kind of hard to do and

200
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
it's actually kind of hard to do and
 

201
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,750
it's actually kind of hard to do and
it's really easy to shoot the cows

so this is with the door open right now
if we close it

220
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
if we close it
 

221
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,749

sand pops up pushes the fence gets out
 

225
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,350
sand pops up pushes the fence gets out
of the way and then the sand falls back

actually quite a bit to it i thought it
was a really simple thing at first until

234
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
was a really simple thing at first until
 

235
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,710
was a really simple thing at first until
i started building it

236
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
i started building it
 

237
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,990
i started building it
and man turns out

238
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
and man turns out

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
where all the blocks go you know and
 

251
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,469
where all the blocks go you know and
i'll build it i'll pause it and build it

252
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
i'll build it i'll pause it and build it
 

253
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,909
i'll build it i'll pause it and build it
um but after i did all that i had like

254
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
um but after i did all that i had like
 

255
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,230
um but after i did all that i had like
five repeaters set wrong

256
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
five repeaters set wrong
 

257
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,990
five repeaters set wrong
and good luck trying to find those five

258
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
and good luck trying to find those five
 

259
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,510
and good luck trying to find those five
repeaters because the whole thing didn't

260
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
repeaters because the whole thing didn't
 

261
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,710
repeaters because the whole thing didn't
work and i had to like

262
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
work and i had to like
 

263
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,430
work and i had to like
reverse engineer it and figure out where

264
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
reverse engineer it and figure out where
 

265
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,070
reverse engineer it and figure out where
i went wrong and oh my goodness

266
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
i went wrong and oh my goodness
 

267
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,909
i went wrong and oh my goodness
i'm just not patient enough guys that's

268
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
i'm just not patient enough guys that's
 

269
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,430
i'm just not patient enough guys that's
my problem

270
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
my problem
 

271
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,110
my problem
uh but we should be able to cover over

272
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
uh but we should be able to cover over
 

273
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,070
uh but we should be able to cover over
almost this redstone

274
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
almost this redstone
 

275
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,830
almost this redstone
let's put some sandstone down here and

276
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
let's put some sandstone down here and
 

277
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,310
let's put some sandstone down here and
then we'll put sand over top uh

278
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
then we'll put sand over top uh
 

279
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,909
then we'll put sand over top uh
but in the end we got it all working

280
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
but in the end we got it all working
 

281
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,749
but in the end we got it all working
here it is very large

282
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
here it is very large
 

283
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,629
here it is very large
though we're gonna have to hide all the

284
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
though we're gonna have to hide all the
 

285
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,070
though we're gonna have to hide all the
pistons and stuff

286
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
pistons and stuff
 

287
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,909
pistons and stuff
there's like four pistons down below

288
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
there's like four pistons down below
 

289
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,070
there's like four pistons down below
that pop up and then there's four

290
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
that pop up and then there's four
 

291
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,350
that pop up and then there's four
um at the top there that go down

292
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
um at the top there that go down
 

293
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,070
um at the top there that go down
yeah we can cover this so maybe what

294
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
yeah we can cover this so maybe what
 

295
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,270
yeah we can cover this so maybe what
we'll do

296
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
we'll do
 

297
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,029
we'll do
i've looked at screenshots of castle

298
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
i've looked at screenshots of castle
 

299
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,710
i've looked at screenshots of castle
gates and usually there's a tower on

300
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
gates and usually there's a tower on
 

301
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,950
gates and usually there's a tower on
each side of the gate

302
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
each side of the gate
 

303
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,189
each side of the gate
so maybe let's let's lay that out maybe

304
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
so maybe let's let's lay that out maybe
 

305
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,110
so maybe let's let's lay that out maybe
this will come out three blocks or so

306
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
this will come out three blocks or so
 

307
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,390
this will come out three blocks or so
then we can go

308
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
then we can go
 

309
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,830
then we can go
five maybe back into the wall

310
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
five maybe back into the wall
 

311
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,670
five maybe back into the wall
if we do that on both sides and build up

312
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
if we do that on both sides and build up
 

313
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,270
if we do that on both sides and build up
a tower

314
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
a tower
 

315
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,590
a tower
i wonder how that would look okay let's

316
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
i wonder how that would look okay let's
 

317
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,749
i wonder how that would look okay let's
get rid of that

318
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
get rid of that
 

319
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,950
get rid of that
um where was it no not there

320
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
um where was it no not there
 

321
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,390
um where was it no not there
or not not sand we want sandstone

322
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
or not not sand we want sandstone
 

323
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,469
or not not sand we want sandstone
yeah tell you what i'm gonna build this

324
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
yeah tell you what i'm gonna build this
 

325
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,150
yeah tell you what i'm gonna build this
up and we'll just get a rough idea of

326
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
up and we'll just get a rough idea of
 

327
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,590
up and we'll just get a rough idea of
what it would look like if it was

328
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
what it would look like if it was
 

329
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,550
what it would look like if it was
if it was plain although that's going to

330
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
if it was plain although that's going to
 

331
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,189
if it was plain although that's going to
be like a

332
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
be like a
 

333
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,230
be like a
fat oh man a fat

334
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
fat oh man a fat
 

335
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,909
fat oh man a fat
skinny tower you know because it's going

336
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
skinny tower you know because it's going
 

337
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,510
skinny tower you know because it's going
to go from here

338
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
to go from here
 

339
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,029
to go from here
to like here and it looks really

340
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
to like here and it looks really
 

341
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,670
to like here and it looks really
thin maybe we need to make it seven

342
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
thin maybe we need to make it seven
 

343
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,469
thin maybe we need to make it seven
blocks

344
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
blocks
 

345
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,070
blocks
at least like maybe come out to here

346
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
at least like maybe come out to here
 

347
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,870
at least like maybe come out to here
oh i don't know the problem is this gate

348
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
oh i don't know the problem is this gate
 

349
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,710
oh i don't know the problem is this gate
itself is not very big

350
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
itself is not very big
 

351
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,870
itself is not very big
because at the limitations of the

352
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
because at the limitations of the
 

353
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,830
because at the limitations of the
pistons

354
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
pistons
 

355
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,150
pistons
usually castle gates the gate is really

356
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
usually castle gates the gate is really
 

357
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,589
usually castle gates the gate is really
big and then the towers are kind of

358
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
big and then the towers are kind of
 

359
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,270
big and then the towers are kind of
small beside it and we got

360
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
small beside it and we got
 

361
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,629
small beside it and we got
a reverse situation going on here

362
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
a reverse situation going on here
 

363
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:10,550
a reverse situation going on here
but we'll see what it looks like

364
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560

 

365
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,469

okay so this is what i wanted to see

366
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
okay so this is what i wanted to see
 

367
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,070
okay so this is what i wanted to see
guys what would it look like if we

368
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
guys what would it look like if we
 

369
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,589
guys what would it look like if we
covered over all the pistons and just

370
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
covered over all the pistons and just
 

371
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,110
covered over all the pistons and just
built up the towers everything's

372
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
built up the towers everything's
 

373
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,589
built up the towers everything's
flat-walled right now

374
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
flat-walled right now
 

375
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,870
flat-walled right now
doesn't look super great does it

376
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
doesn't look super great does it
 

377
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,189
doesn't look super great does it
but this is giving me ideas for how we

378
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
but this is giving me ideas for how we
 

379
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,830
but this is giving me ideas for how we
can change it so maybe

380
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
can change it so maybe
 

381
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,830
can change it so maybe
if we shave away the sides if we make it

382
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
if we shave away the sides if we make it
 

383
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,589
if we shave away the sides if we make it
five blocks wide

384
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
five blocks wide
 

385
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,670
five blocks wide
the towers look pretty bulky don't they

386
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
the towers look pretty bulky don't they
 

387
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,029
the towers look pretty bulky don't they
yeah let's do that and we don't actually

388
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
yeah let's do that and we don't actually
 

389
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,670
yeah let's do that and we don't actually
need to have the towers matching

390
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
need to have the towers matching
 

391
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,350
need to have the towers matching
the height of the middle like the middle

392
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
the height of the middle like the middle
 

393
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,189
the height of the middle like the middle
has to go that high to block out the

394
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
has to go that high to block out the
 

395
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,550
has to go that high to block out the
pistons but

396
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
pistons but
 

397
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,029
pistons but
we might be able to shave a couple

398
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
we might be able to shave a couple
 

399
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,309
we might be able to shave a couple
blocks off the top

400
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
blocks off the top
 

401
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,029
blocks off the top
oh can i get it wow that was great

402
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
oh can i get it wow that was great
 

403
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,430
oh can i get it wow that was great
nice if we shave a couple blocks off the

404
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
nice if we shave a couple blocks off the
 

405
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,909
nice if we shave a couple blocks off the
top on both sides

406
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
top on both sides
 

407
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,390
top on both sides
uh it'll probably look a bit better too

408
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400

 

409
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,230

okay here we go guys this is what i

410
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
okay here we go guys this is what i
 

411
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,670
okay here we go guys this is what i
trained for this is what it's all been

412
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
trained for this is what it's all been
 

413
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,150
trained for this is what it's all been
about

414
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
about
 

415
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,749
about
i want to get to the top of that tower

416
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
i want to get to the top of that tower
 

417
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,070
i want to get to the top of that tower
there it's only one block

418
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
there it's only one block
 

419
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,550
there it's only one block
wide and very far away can i do it

420
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
wide and very far away can i do it
 

421
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,270
wide and very far away can i do it
no oh i gotta keep practicing

422
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
no oh i gotta keep practicing
 

423
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,430
no oh i gotta keep practicing
okay uh i'm gonna lower this side one

424
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
okay uh i'm gonna lower this side one
 

425
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,790
okay uh i'm gonna lower this side one
more block too i'm just playing around

426
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
more block too i'm just playing around
 

427
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,510
more block too i'm just playing around
with the

428
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
with the
 

429
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,029
with the
the size a bit and i think a little bit

430
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
the size a bit and i think a little bit
 

431
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,629
the size a bit and i think a little bit
lower is better

432
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
lower is better
 

433
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,389
lower is better
yeah let's just shave that off there and

434
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
yeah let's just shave that off there and
 

435
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,909
yeah let's just shave that off there and
there and there

436
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
there and there
 

437
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,029
there and there
cool put these in

438
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039

 

439
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,550

i wanted to jump over there and i messed

440
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
i wanted to jump over there and i messed
 

441
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,630
i wanted to jump over there and i messed
it up that's better

442
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
it up that's better
 

443
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,350
it up that's better
right i think so and then what we'll

444
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
right i think so and then what we'll
 

445
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,230
right i think so and then what we'll
probably do is have some kind of cross

446
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
probably do is have some kind of cross
 

447
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,470
probably do is have some kind of cross
cross section over here perhaps

448
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
cross section over here perhaps
 

449
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,030
cross section over here perhaps
like a walkway between the two towers

450
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
like a walkway between the two towers
 

451
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,509
like a walkway between the two towers
and then

452
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
and then
 

453
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,070
and then
doors on both sides and maybe we'll make

454
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
doors on both sides and maybe we'll make
 

455
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,509
doors on both sides and maybe we'll make
it so you can actually walk up there

456
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
it so you can actually walk up there
 

457
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,870
it so you can actually walk up there
whoa yeah like put doors here and

458
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
whoa yeah like put doors here and
 

459
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,070
whoa yeah like put doors here and
here and if we do

460
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
here and if we do
 

461
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,550
here and if we do
the this whatever this is called

462
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
the this whatever this is called
 

463
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,470
the this whatever this is called
that might look good too

464
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480

 

465
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,710

uh no it doesn't you can't see it

466
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
uh no it doesn't you can't see it
 

467
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,829
uh no it doesn't you can't see it
because there's sandstone behind

468
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
because there's sandstone behind
 

469
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,070
because there's sandstone behind
hmm it needs maybe some wood mixed in

470
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
hmm it needs maybe some wood mixed in
 

471
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,190
hmm it needs maybe some wood mixed in
with all this doesn't it

472
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200

 

473
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,710

i don't know how to do it though

474
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720

 

475
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,870

all right everybody so check it out i

476
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
all right everybody so check it out i
 

477
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,310
all right everybody so check it out i
know things look pretty rough there for

478
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
know things look pretty rough there for
 

479
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,590
know things look pretty rough there for
a while but i'm actually

480
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
a while but i'm actually
 

481
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,150
a while but i'm actually
really happy with how this turned out i

482
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
really happy with how this turned out i
 

483
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,910
really happy with how this turned out i
decided to keep it pretty plain i didn't

484
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
decided to keep it pretty plain i didn't
 

485
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,790
decided to keep it pretty plain i didn't
mix any wood in with it really

486
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
mix any wood in with it really
 

487
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,949
mix any wood in with it really
instead what i did is i tried to give it

488
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
instead what i did is i tried to give it
 

489
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,190
instead what i did is i tried to give it
shape with

490
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
shape with
 

491
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,430
shape with
or like shadows by by the shape of it

492
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
or like shadows by by the shape of it
 

493
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,190
or like shadows by by the shape of it
and also i mixed in different textures

494
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
and also i mixed in different textures
 

495
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,350
and also i mixed in different textures
so we got the smooth and the chiseled

496
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
so we got the smooth and the chiseled
 

497
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,949
so we got the smooth and the chiseled
kind of tried to create some patterns

498
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
kind of tried to create some patterns
 

499
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,430
kind of tried to create some patterns
with it like it kind of goes

500
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440

little access to the wiring
 

607
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,350
little access to the wiring
and to these upper levels here i don't

608
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
and to these upper levels here i don't
 

609
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,030
and to these upper levels here i don't
know why

610
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
know why
 

611
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,470

i also hooked up the gate to a timer so

616
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
i also hooked up the gate to a timer so
 

617
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,790
i also hooked up the gate to a timer so
the way this is going to work

618
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
the way this is going to work
 

619
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,829
the way this is going to work
you hit the button to open it

620

621
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,949

like so and i decided to make it just

622
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
like so and i decided to make it just
 

623
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,230
like so and i decided to make it just
auto close on its

624
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
auto close on its
 

625
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,670
auto close on its
on its own after a certain amount of

626
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
on its own after a certain amount of
 

627
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,110
on its own after a certain amount of
time the reason for that

628
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
time the reason for that
 

629
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,310
time the reason for that
there it goes is because whenever i have

630
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320

i tried putting endstone nether brick

788
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
i tried putting endstone nether brick
 

789
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,069
i tried putting endstone nether brick
and my mycelium all together and it

790
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
and my mycelium all together and it
 

791
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,470
and my mycelium all together and it
looked

792
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
looked
 

793
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,430
looked
really good so those are the three

794
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
really good so those are the three
 

795
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,870
really good so those are the three
blocks we're going to go with

796
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
blocks we're going to go with
 

797
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,990
blocks we're going to go with
and probably sea lanterns for lighting

798
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
and probably sea lanterns for lighting
 

799
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,189
and probably sea lanterns for lighting
and hopefully we can come up with

800
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
and hopefully we can come up with
 

801
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,910
and hopefully we can come up with
something cool we got to make a

802
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
something cool we got to make a
 

803
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,829
something cool we got to make a
track out to our sand collection area

804
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
track out to our sand collection area
 

805
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,629
track out to our sand collection area
because

806
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
because
 

807
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,189
because
used up all our sandstone today and we

808
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
used up all our sandstone today and we
 

809
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,150
used up all our sandstone today and we
need more

810
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
need more
 

811
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,590
need more
so we may as well get that done with

812
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
so we may as well get that done with
 

813
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,269
so we may as well get that done with
already

814
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
already
 

815
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,949
already
this is probably enough for for today

816
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
this is probably enough for for today
 

817
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,910
this is probably enough for for today
anyway so let me get out of here and we

yeah so currently guys we need two
nether tunnels built we got the track in

824
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
nether tunnels built we got the track in
 

825
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,110
nether tunnels built we got the track in
this one

826
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
this one
 

827
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,430

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
we got nothing it's just this is raw
 

835
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,990
we got nothing it's just this is raw
right now

836
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
right now
 

837
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,189
right now
this goes out to the desert and i

838
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
this goes out to the desert and i
 

839
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,269
this goes out to the desert and i
basically run it every time

840
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
basically run it every time
 

841
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,790
basically run it every time
so this is mostly for me because i want

842
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
so this is mostly for me because i want
 

843
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,470
so this is mostly for me because i want
to save some time

844
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
to save some time
 

845
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,230
to save some time
um i got mining fatigue so we can't make

846
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
um i got mining fatigue so we can't make
 

847
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,550
um i got mining fatigue so we can't make
any mistakes here

848
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
any mistakes here
 

849
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,509
any mistakes here
for a minute anyway so i think what

850
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
for a minute anyway so i think what
 

851
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,069
for a minute anyway so i think what
we'll do

852
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
we'll do
 

853
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,310
we'll do
maybe go out like this oh invisible and

854
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
maybe go out like this oh invisible and
 

855
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,509
maybe go out like this oh invisible and
have the track down one block

856
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
have the track down one block
 

857
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,910
have the track down one block
like so i always like to lower the track

858
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
like so i always like to lower the track
 

859
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,430
like so i always like to lower the track
one just so we don't get

860
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
one just so we don't get
 

861
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,390
one just so we don't get
as many zombie pigmen on the track helps

862
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
as many zombie pigmen on the track helps
 

863
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,230
as many zombie pigmen on the track helps
to reduce the spotting if you got blocks

864
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
to reduce the spotting if you got blocks
 

865
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,990
to reduce the spotting if you got blocks
beside it

866
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
beside it
 

867
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,270
beside it
um yeah then i guess mycelium would come

868
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
um yeah then i guess mycelium would come
 

869
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,870
um yeah then i guess mycelium would come
next i want that on the ground too

870
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880

 

871
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,069

so weird having mining fatigue

872
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
so weird having mining fatigue
 

873
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,350
so weird having mining fatigue
uh let's go too wide with it

874
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360

 

875
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,750

and then what we should probably do is

876
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
and then what we should probably do is
 

877
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,070
and then what we should probably do is
put in some vertical

878
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
put in some vertical
 

879
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,950
put in some vertical
pillars i like having something vertical

880
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
pillars i like having something vertical
 

881
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,750
pillars i like having something vertical
in my nether tunnels always that way

882
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
in my nether tunnels always that way
 

883
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,270
in my nether tunnels always that way
uh you can kind of get a sense of speed

884
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
uh you can kind of get a sense of speed
 

885
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,789
uh you can kind of get a sense of speed
let's do a two two wide thing

886
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
let's do a two two wide thing
 

887
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,310
let's do a two two wide thing
because if everything's horizontal

888
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
because if everything's horizontal
 

889
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,909
because if everything's horizontal
you'll go down it and nothing really

890
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
you'll go down it and nothing really
 

891
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,750
you'll go down it and nothing really
changes but if you have vertical lines

892
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
changes but if you have vertical lines
 

893
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,430
changes but if you have vertical lines
they whiz by you

894
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
they whiz by you
 

895
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,830
they whiz by you
and i just like the way that looks

896
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
and i just like the way that looks
 

897
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,430
and i just like the way that looks
making nether tunnels is like one of my

898
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
making nether tunnels is like one of my
 

899
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,710
making nether tunnels is like one of my
favorite things in this game i don't

900
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
favorite things in this game i don't
 

901
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,870
favorite things in this game i don't
know why

902
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
know why
 

903
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,150
know why
oh no can i break it oh 10 good

904
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
oh no can i break it oh 10 good
 

905
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,270
oh no can i break it oh 10 good
uh it's fairly simple it doesn't take

906
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
uh it's fairly simple it doesn't take
 

907
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,909
uh it's fairly simple it doesn't take
too long to do them and

908
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
too long to do them and
 

909
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,070
too long to do them and
you can usually come up with a different

910
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
you can usually come up with a different
 

911
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,390
you can usually come up with a different
design every time it's not too tough

912
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400

 

913
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,990

yeah let's let's just like build these

914
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
yeah let's let's just like build these
 

915
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,470
yeah let's let's just like build these
up so we'll have a five block

916
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
up so we'll have a five block
 

917
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,350
up so we'll have a five block
gap between and then just repeat this

918
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
gap between and then just repeat this
 

919
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,990
gap between and then just repeat this
section over and over probably

920
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
section over and over probably
 

921
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,230
section over and over probably
uh we could

922
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240

 

923
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,909

we should probably hide some lighting

924
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
we should probably hide some lighting
 

925
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,870
we should probably hide some lighting
here too

926
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880

 

927
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,150

i don't know if we want to go in one

928
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
i don't know if we want to go in one
 

929
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,830
i don't know if we want to go in one
maybe over here now let's go in one

930
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
maybe over here now let's go in one
 

931
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,830
maybe over here now let's go in one
yeah over here we'll do sea lantern and

932
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840

 

933
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,070

then

934
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
then
 

935
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,110
then
let's do another stair the other way

936
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
let's do another stair the other way
 

937
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,630
let's do another stair the other way
doing a little building with you guys

938
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
doing a little building with you guys
 

939
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,789
doing a little building with you guys
for a change

940
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
for a change
 

941
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,990
for a change
i don't know if you like that or not

942
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
i don't know if you like that or not
 

943
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,710
i don't know if you like that or not
something like that yeah and of course

944
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
something like that yeah and of course
 

945
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,390
something like that yeah and of course
i'll have to do the sides so you can't

946
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
i'll have to do the sides so you can't
 

947
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,070
i'll have to do the sides so you can't
see the gap

948
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
see the gap
 

949
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,669
see the gap
all right and

950
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
all right and
 

951
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,909
all right and
maybe we'll do a line at the bottom as

952
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
maybe we'll do a line at the bottom as
 

953
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,789
maybe we'll do a line at the bottom as
well

954
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
well
 

955
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,750
well
between here it's pretty close in color

956
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
between here it's pretty close in color
 

957
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,549
between here it's pretty close in color
to the mycelium i like that

958
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
to the mycelium i like that
 

959
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,710
to the mycelium i like that
um

960
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720

 

961
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,310

okay i was having a little bit of

962
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
okay i was having a little bit of
 

963
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,230
okay i was having a little bit of
trouble designing this middle part here

964
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
trouble designing this middle part here
 

965
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,070
trouble designing this middle part here
so i decided to do it off camera and

966
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
so i decided to do it off camera and
 

967
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,830
so i decided to do it off camera and
this is what i came up with

968
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
this is what i came up with
 

969
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,909
this is what i came up with
uh-huh this is some random weird shape

970
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
uh-huh this is some random weird shape
 

971
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,310
uh-huh this is some random weird shape
uh i do have an idea for it though

972
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
uh i do have an idea for it though
 

973
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,029
uh i do have an idea for it though
something i've done in this game for

974
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
something i've done in this game for
 

975
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,029
something i've done in this game for

right
seeds quickly bone meal

1002
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
seeds quickly bone meal
 

1003
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,350
seeds quickly bone meal
all right hopefully it's not too too

1004
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
all right hopefully it's not too too
 

1005
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,669
all right hopefully it's not too too
yellow

1006
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
yellow
 

1007
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,510
yellow
yeah and we should probably throw in

1008
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
yeah and we should probably throw in
 

1009
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,950
yeah and we should probably throw in
some lighting here

1010
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
some lighting here
 

1011
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,590
some lighting here
i kind of made this in a way that we can

1012
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
i kind of made this in a way that we can
 

1013
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,750
i kind of made this in a way that we can
hide it

1014
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
hide it
 

1015
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,350
hide it
all right put it there and then the half

1016
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
all right put it there and then the half
 

1017
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,270
all right put it there and then the half
slab blocks it i believe

1018
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
slab blocks it i believe
 

1019
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,870
slab blocks it i believe
yeah totally blocked we can't see it at

1020
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
yeah totally blocked we can't see it at
 

1021
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,390
yeah totally blocked we can't see it at
all so i don't make it look like it's

1022
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
all so i don't make it look like it's
 

1023
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,590
all so i don't make it look like it's
glowing

1024
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
glowing
 

1025
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,270
glowing
then we just need some kind of batting

1026
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
then we just need some kind of batting
 

1027
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,149
then we just need some kind of batting
for that

1028
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159

 

1029
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,710

i think that's kind of cool though right

1030
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
i think that's kind of cool though right
 

1031
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,990
i think that's kind of cool though right
maybe we'll change it to carrots

1032
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
maybe we'll change it to carrots
 

1033
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,549
maybe we'll change it to carrots
or something later if we want something

1034
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
or something later if we want something
 

1035
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,390
or something later if we want something
greener that's kind of yellow

1036
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
greener that's kind of yellow
 

1037
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,870
greener that's kind of yellow
um anyway let's work out the rest of

1038
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
um anyway let's work out the rest of
 

1039
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,350
um anyway let's work out the rest of
this we gotta do the ceiling now

1040
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
this we gotta do the ceiling now
 

1041
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,270
this we gotta do the ceiling now
which is always my least favorite part

1042
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
which is always my least favorite part
 

1043
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,549
which is always my least favorite part
of a build

1044
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
of a build
 

1045
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,789
of a build
let's kind of i love arches let's do an

1046
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
let's kind of i love arches let's do an
 

1047
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,669
let's kind of i love arches let's do an
arch

1048
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679

 

1049
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,789

something like that and we can

1050
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
something like that and we can
 

1051
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,830
something like that and we can
probably connect it together over here

1052
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
probably connect it together over here
 

1053
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,950
probably connect it together over here
to this arch

1054
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
to this arch
 

1055
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,630
to this arch
oh see what this turns out like

1056
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
oh see what this turns out like
 

1057
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,669
oh see what this turns out like
okay let's copy it so one

1058
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
okay let's copy it so one
 

1059
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,070
okay let's copy it so one
two three back up like that

1060
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
two three back up like that
 

1061
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,310
two three back up like that
and then this goes out to the other one

1062
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
and then this goes out to the other one
 

1063
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,029
and then this goes out to the other one
as well

1064
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039

 

1065
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,149

all right how's that we're just gonna do

1066
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
all right how's that we're just gonna do
 

1067
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,909
all right how's that we're just gonna do
one section here together and i'll i'll

1068
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
one section here together and i'll i'll
 

1069
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,430
one section here together and i'll i'll
just copy the rest of it off camera

1070
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
just copy the rest of it off camera
 

1071
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,510
just copy the rest of it off camera
hopefully

1072
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
hopefully
 

1073
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,510
hopefully
yeah that's pretty cool we got a bit of

1074
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
yeah that's pretty cool we got a bit of
 

1075
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,710
yeah that's pretty cool we got a bit of
a gap here

1076
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
a gap here
 

1077
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,390
a gap here
though that we can see through

1078
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400

 

1079
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,029

so let's fill this in with end stone as

1080
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
so let's fill this in with end stone as
 

1081
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,350
so let's fill this in with end stone as
well

1082
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360

 

1083
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,990

should we go up one more like on the

1084
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
should we go up one more like on the
 

1085
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,710
should we go up one more like on the
side here let's try it

1086
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
side here let's try it
 

1087
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,830
side here let's try it
oops just spam blocks let's fill it in

1088
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
oops just spam blocks let's fill it in
 

1089
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,270
oops just spam blocks let's fill it in
with something that's all we really

1090
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
with something that's all we really
 

1091
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,470
with something that's all we really
gotta do

1092
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480

 

1093
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,510

yay

1094
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520

 

1095
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,830

yeah that's good right um

1096
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
yeah that's good right um
 

1097
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,750
yeah that's good right um
maybe we could do some nether brick

1098
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
maybe we could do some nether brick
 

1099
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,950
maybe we could do some nether brick
stairs then that go

1100
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
stairs then that go
 

1101
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,590
stairs then that go
up like this and meet meat in the middle

1102
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
up like this and meet meat in the middle
 

1103
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,510
up like this and meet meat in the middle
as well

1104
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520

 

1105
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,190

let's go one more here let's actually

1106
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
let's go one more here let's actually
 

1107
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,990
let's go one more here let's actually
let's put blocks here

1108
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000

 

1109
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750

oh yeah i like that okay that's what

1112
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
we're doing
 

1113
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,710
we're doing
do it on this side and i guess that's

1114
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
do it on this side and i guess that's
 

1115
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,710
do it on this side and i guess that's
about it let me try to work out the last

1116
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
about it let me try to work out the last
 

1117
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,070
about it let me try to work out the last
little bits here

1118
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
little bits here
 

1119
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,590
little bits here
and we'll see it all done

1120
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600

 

1121
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,669

okay guys so i just went ahead here and

1122
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
okay guys so i just went ahead here and
 

1123
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,909
okay guys so i just went ahead here and
i extended the track a bit further

1124
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
i extended the track a bit further
 

1125
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,149
i extended the track a bit further
uh the tunnel a bit further so we'd have

1126
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
uh the tunnel a bit further so we'd have
 

1127
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,669
uh the tunnel a bit further so we'd have
an idea of what it looks like when it's

1128
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
an idea of what it looks like when it's
 

1129
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,029
an idea of what it looks like when it's
all done here

1130
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
all done here
 

1131
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,510
all done here
and it keeps repeating over and over i

1132
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
and it keeps repeating over and over i
 

1133
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,510
and it keeps repeating over and over i
think that's pretty good right

1134
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
think that's pretty good right
 

1135
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,870
think that's pretty good right
i like it yeah i think that's what we'll

1136
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
i like it yeah i think that's what we'll
 

1137
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,990
i like it yeah i think that's what we'll
go ahead with

1138
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
go ahead with
 

1139
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,230
go ahead with
this is how i finished it up by the way

1140
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
this is how i finished it up by the way
 

1141
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,190
this is how i finished it up by the way
i

1142
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
i
 

1143
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,470
i
i did three of these arch things

1144
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
i did three of these arch things
 

1145
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,870
i did three of these arch things
in the center part and then i did a beam

1146
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
in the center part and then i did a beam
 

1147
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,270
in the center part and then i did a beam
running across the middle

1148
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
running across the middle
 

1149
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,830
running across the middle
and i like that quite a bit over here is

1150
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
and i like that quite a bit over here is
 

1151
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,110
and i like that quite a bit over here is
another brick

1152
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
another brick
 

1153
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,750
another brick
again i tried to keep the beam running

1154
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
again i tried to keep the beam running
 

1155
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,149
again i tried to keep the beam running
through

1156
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
through
 

1157
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,789
through
type of feel just through some end stone

1158
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
type of feel just through some end stone
 

1159
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,350
type of feel just through some end stone
in the back behind the wheat here

1160
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
in the back behind the wheat here
 

1161
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,549
in the back behind the wheat here
and that is

1162
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
and that is
 

1163
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,510
and that is
that is that's all there is to it i've

alone i don't want to memorize it

alone i don't want to memorize it
 

1233
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,430
alone i don't want to memorize it
i won't be able to i know it and i don't

otherwise it'll be too difficult um
 

1241
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,390
otherwise it'll be too difficult um
so yeah we probably can't memorize it

1242
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
so yeah we probably can't memorize it
 

1243
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,549
