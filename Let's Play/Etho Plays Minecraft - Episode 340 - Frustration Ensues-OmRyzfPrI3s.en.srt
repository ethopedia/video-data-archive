had a few randomly teleports which is

442
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:06,510
had a few randomly teleports which is
 

443
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,790
had a few randomly teleports which is
something we're going to be keeping an

444
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,800
something we're going to be keeping an
 

445
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,790
something we're going to be keeping an
eye on too as we do this like while

446
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
eye on too as we do this like while
 

447
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,380
eye on too as we do this like while
they're sitting that they will teleport

448
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,390
they're sitting that they will teleport
 

449

451
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,910
to me so I'm hoping that doesn't happen
because then they'll get teleported out

452
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:16,920
because then they'll get teleported out
 

453
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,700
because then they'll get teleported out
of their places and I won't be able to

of their places and I won't be able to
 

455
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,380
of their places and I won't be able to
keep this thing running all right that's

456
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,390
keep this thing running all right that's
 

457
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:31,910
keep this thing running all right that's

so that zombies aren't going to be
 

477

what should we do with the outside of
this building because I don't want to

cube of blandness currently I was
 

489
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,960
cube of blandness currently I was
considering tried to convert it into a

don't know if it's the right shape those

498
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
don't know if it's the right shape those
 

499
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,470
don't know if it's the right shape those
chestal it's a little bit fat is what

500

chestal it's a little bit fat is what
 

501
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,670
chestal it's a little bit fat is what
I'm concerned about

502
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm concerned about
 

503
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm concerned about
you must have spawned in there I still

you must have spawned in there I still
 

505
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,829
you must have spawned in there I still
have the torches in but there's probably

506
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
have the torches in but there's probably
 

507
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,569
have the torches in but there's probably
a few dark spots all right so let's go

508
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:40,579
a few dark spots all right so let's go
 

509
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,530
a few dark spots all right so let's go
on up okay hopefully and pull this off

510
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:43,540
on up okay hopefully and pull this off
 

511
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,980
on up okay hopefully and pull this off
very good so all the guys are seem like

very good so all the guys are seem like
 

513
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,509
very good so all the guys are seem like
they're staying in place which is also

514
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
they're staying in place which is also
 

515
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,300
they're staying in place which is also
very good some people are asking about

516
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,310
very good some people are asking about
 

517
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,910
very good some people are asking about
the half slabs here again these are to

518
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:54,920
the half slabs here again these are to
 

519
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,759
the half slabs here again these are to
prevent spiders from spawning in here I

520
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:57,769
prevent spiders from spawning in here I
 

521
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,769

especially don't want spiders spawning
 

523
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,449
especially don't want spiders spawning
because they will knock these guys off

524
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:01,459
because they will knock these guys off
 

525
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,389
because they will knock these guys off
of their their pedestals they need to

stay put
 

529
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,840
stay put
although the dog is trapped there no

although the dog is trapped there no
 

531
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,420
although the dog is trapped there no
matter what he can't get out but the cat

532
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,430
matter what he can't get out but the cat
 

533
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,380
matter what he can't get out but the cat
can be knocked around the two tall mobs

534
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,390
can be knocked around the two tall mobs
 

535
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,939
can be knocked around the two tall mobs
they won't shouldn't be able to knock

536
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:15,949
they won't shouldn't be able to knock
 

537
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,120
they won't shouldn't be able to knock
him down the way I got the setup so

538
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,130
him down the way I got the setup so
 

539
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,210
him down the way I got the setup so
that's good and the top half of the dog

540
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,220
that's good and the top half of the dog
 

541
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,110
that's good and the top half of the dog
is showing so he can still path find to

542
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,120
is showing so he can still path find to
 

543
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,059
is showing so he can still path find to
the skeletons with this setup

544
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:28,069
the skeletons with this setup
 

545
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,120
the skeletons with this setup
he only cannot see in this this this

546
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,130
he only cannot see in this this this
 

547
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,430
he only cannot see in this this this
this and this spot up close here like if

548
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,440
this and this spot up close here like if
 

549
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,259
this and this spot up close here like if
there's a skeleton here he it won't run

550
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:38,269
there's a skeleton here he it won't run
 

551
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,290
there's a skeleton here he it won't run
away from the dog until it moves to like

552
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,300
away from the dog until it moves to like
 

553
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,389
away from the dog until it moves to like
over here so keep that in mind with this

554
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:45,399
over here so keep that in mind with this
 

555
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,610
over here so keep that in mind with this
I could get them in a better spot if I

556
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:48,620
I could get them in a better spot if I
 

557
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,889
I could get them in a better spot if I
made it three tall but I don't think

558
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:50,899
made it three tall but I don't think
 

559
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,449
made it three tall but I don't think
it's really worth it okay but yeah these

560
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:55,459
it's really worth it okay but yeah these
 

561
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,280
it's really worth it okay but yeah these
are to stop the spiders from spawning

562
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,290
are to stop the spiders from spawning
 

563
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,110
are to stop the spiders from spawning
somebody suggested

564
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
somebody suggested
 

565
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,230
somebody suggested
I just want to point this out they

566
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
I just want to point this out they
 

567
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,410
I just want to point this out they
suggested I put fences here so that

568
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:05,420
suggested I put fences here so that
 

569
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,120
suggested I put fences here so that
there would be more air blocks like

570
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,130
there would be more air blocks like
 

571
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,820
there would be more air blocks like
above this fence is an air block if we

572
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:09,830
above this fence is an air block if we
 

573
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,760
above this fence is an air block if we
do it this way and the more air blocks

574
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:12,770
do it this way and the more air blocks
 

575
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,690
do it this way and the more air blocks
you have like level here the quicker

576
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:16,700
you have like level here the quicker
 

577
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,010
you have like level here the quicker
your spawn rate is going to be like

578
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,020
your spawn rate is going to be like
 

579
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,810
your spawn rate is going to be like
having these walls these blocks on the

580
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:19,820
having these walls these blocks on the
 

581
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,780
having these walls these blocks on the
walls at this level is going to decrease

582
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:22,790
walls at this level is going to decrease
 

583
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,850
walls at this level is going to decrease
it so um you know ideally I should try

584
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:27,860
it so um you know ideally I should try
 

585
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,850
it so um you know ideally I should try
to remove those but I don't really care

586
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:29,860
to remove those but I don't really care
 

587
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,500
to remove those but I don't really care
and same with these slabs each of these

588
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,510
and same with these slabs each of these
 

589
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,180
and same with these slabs each of these
will reduce the spawn rates because it

590
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,190
will reduce the spawn rates because it
 

591
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,100
will reduce the spawn rates because it
takes away in air space at this at this

592
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,110
takes away in air space at this at this
 

593
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,990
takes away in air space at this at this
height here um so this seems like a good

594
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
height here um so this seems like a good
 

595
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,060
height here um so this seems like a good
idea this does not stop spiders from

596
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,070
idea this does not stop spiders from
 

597
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,890
idea this does not stop spiders from
spawning though like they won't spawn on

598
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:47,900
spawning though like they won't spawn on
 

599
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,050
spawning though like they won't spawn on
top of the fence but if they try to

600
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,060
top of the fence but if they try to
 

601
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,990
top of the fence but if they try to
spawn like here they're going to do that

602
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,000
spawn like here they're going to do that
 

603
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,560
spawn like here they're going to do that
3 by 3 check like all around and they're

604
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,570
3 by 3 check like all around and they're
 

605
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,150
3 by 3 check like all around and they're
not going to get stopped by anything

606
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
not going to get stopped by anything
 

607
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,140
not going to get stopped by anything
because this is considered air still so

608
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,150
because this is considered air still so
 

609
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,140
because this is considered air still so
yeah that does not work also having a

610
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,150
yeah that does not work also having a
 

611
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,900
yeah that does not work also having a
half slab like on the ceiling instead of

612
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:07,910
half slab like on the ceiling instead of
 

613
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,439
half slab like on the ceiling instead of
on the ground doesn't work either

614
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:10,449
on the ground doesn't work either
 

615
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,880
on the ground doesn't work either
spiders will still spawn if you do that

616
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:12,890
spiders will still spawn if you do that
 

617
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,240
spiders will still spawn if you do that
so I just wanted to point that out it's

618
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,250
so I just wanted to point that out it's
 

619
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,340
so I just wanted to point that out it's
a good suggestion though but it just

620
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,350
a good suggestion though but it just
 

621
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,710
a good suggestion though but it just
doesn't work alright let's get it going

622
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:23,720
doesn't work alright let's get it going
 

623
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,579
doesn't work alright let's get it going
oh I should have known that was gonna

624
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:27,589
oh I should have known that was gonna
 

625
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,010
oh I should have known that was gonna
happen

626
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,020
happen
 

627
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,930
happen
let's go back up so this is six layers

628
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:33,940
let's go back up so this is six layers
 

629
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,140
let's go back up so this is six layers
six layers and what is it it's like a 13

630
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,150
six layers and what is it it's like a 13
 

631
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:46,000
six layers and what is it it's like a 13
by 7 each of these things - because it's

632
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,010

a little while ago again we're putting
 

761
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,820
a little while ago again we're putting
like the collection area for this thing

762
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:46,830
like the collection area for this thing
 

763
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,180
like the collection area for this thing
over here we're also possibly going to

764
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,190
over here we're also possibly going to
 

765
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,190
over here we're also possibly going to
experiment with that setting something

766
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200
experiment with that setting something
 

767
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,930
experiment with that setting something
up in the nether with this knob system

768
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:53,940
up in the nether with this knob system
 

769
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,630
up in the nether with this knob system
but we'll worry about that later

770
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
but we'll worry about that later

right now this gunpowder cool so I set

776
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,470
right now this gunpowder cool so I set
 

777
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,320
right now this gunpowder cool so I set
this up in a way I planned it this way I

778
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,330
this up in a way I planned it this way I
 

779
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,470
this up in a way I planned it this way I
wanted a instead of converging all the

780
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
wanted a instead of converging all the
 

781
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,419
wanted a instead of converging all the
mobs into a one by one tube like I

782
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:14,429
mobs into a one by one tube like I
 

783
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:16,460

kind of effect like where you can watch

786
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:18,929
kind of effect like where you can watch
 

787
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,320
kind of effect like where you can watch
and cascade down and I might also want

788
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,330
and cascade down and I might also want
 

789
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,630
and cascade down and I might also want
to extend this up higher

790
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:23,640
to extend this up higher
 

791
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,450
to extend this up higher
so you can see it better so I'm going to
