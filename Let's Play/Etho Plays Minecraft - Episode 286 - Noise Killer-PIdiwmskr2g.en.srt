00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,170
looking at the ground though we kind of
 

319
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,560
looking at the ground though we kind of
need like a 3x3 space to drown them I

320
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,570
need like a 3x3 space to drown them I
 

321
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,490
need like a 3x3 space to drown them I
thinking mostly stairs don't have much

322
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:00,500
thinking mostly stairs don't have much
 

323
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,139
thinking mostly stairs don't have much
surface space so probably the place

324
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:05,149
surface space so probably the place
 

325
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:06,850
surface space so probably the place
we're going to have to put a kill trap

326
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:06,860
we're going to have to put a kill trap
 

327
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:15,550
we're going to have to put a kill trap
is if we cut out a 3x3 area here let's

328
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:15,560
is if we cut out a 3x3 area here let's
 

329
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,280
is if we cut out a 3x3 area here let's
just block the water for right now 3 by

330
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,290
just block the water for right now 3 by
 

331
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,699
just block the water for right now 3 by
3 here and a 3x3 area here will have

332
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:21,709
3 here and a 3x3 area here will have
 

333
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,980
3 here and a 3x3 area here will have
some Pistons that allow the bigger

334
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:23,990
some Pistons that allow the bigger
 

335
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,620
some Pistons that allow the bigger
slimes to fall down and then we'll drop

336
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:26,630
slimes to fall down and then we'll drop
 

337
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,350
slimes to fall down and then we'll drop
them into a bunch of water I guess

338
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360

 

339
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,590

probably yeah we probably just need two

340
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
probably yeah we probably just need two
 

341
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,880
probably yeah we probably just need two
Pistons really one here that'll oh no no

342
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:39,890
Pistons really one here that'll oh no no
 

343
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,800
Pistons really one here that'll oh no no
no never mind never mind

344
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:41,810
no never mind never mind
 

345
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,650
no never mind never mind
we needed to go in one block further

346
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:44,660
we needed to go in one block further
 

347
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,829
we needed to go in one block further
actually if we have a piston here can we

348
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:50,839
actually if we have a piston here can we
 

349
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:58,650
actually if we have a piston here can we
do that here no we can't umm that's

350
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:58,660

 

351
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,940

because if if we had like a shape like

352
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:02,950
because if if we had like a shape like
 

353
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,220
because if if we had like a shape like
this the medium and the large slimes

354
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,230
this the medium and the large slimes
 

355
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,620
this the medium and the large slimes
would pass right over top that just the

356
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,630
would pass right over top that just the
 

357
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,490
would pass right over top that just the
small ones would fall down so that's one

358
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:11,500
small ones would fall down so that's one
 

359
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,970
small ones would fall down so that's one
option

360
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:11,980
option
 

361
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,050
option
a shape like this would work too

362
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,060
a shape like this would work too
 

363
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:24,090
a shape like this would work too
oh no no they want it yeah I think we'll

364
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,100
oh no no they want it yeah I think we'll
 

365
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,040
oh no no they want it yeah I think we'll
need two pistons I'm going to mess with

366
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,050
need two pistons I'm going to mess with
 

367
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,550
need two pistons I'm going to mess with
this for a second

368
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
this for a second
 

369
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
this for a second
well I think we're going to do it like

370
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,490
well I think we're going to do it like
 

371
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,260
well I think we're going to do it like
this

372
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,270
this
 

373
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,360
this
I moved the whole over two blocks this

374
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,370
I moved the whole over two blocks this
 

375
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,770
I moved the whole over two blocks this
way it's still a 3x3 hole so if we want

376
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:37,780
way it's still a 3x3 hole so if we want
 

377
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,900
way it's still a 3x3 hole so if we want
if we want to kill the slimes will have

378
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:39,910
if we want to kill the slimes will have
 

379
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,940
if we want to kill the slimes will have
the Pistons retracted this will be open

380
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:41,950
the Pistons retracted this will be open
 

381
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,400
the Pistons retracted this will be open
big slimes medium slimes small slimes

382
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,410
big slimes medium slimes small slimes
 

383
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,500
big slimes medium slimes small slimes
will be able to fall down there I'm

384
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,510
will be able to fall down there I'm
 

385
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,270
will be able to fall down there I'm
going to make the hole four blocks deep

386
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,280
going to make the hole four blocks deep
 

387
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,760
going to make the hole four blocks deep
so they should be able to stack on top

388
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:50,770
so they should be able to stack on top
 

389
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,010
so they should be able to stack on top
of each other like if there's a big

390
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,020
of each other like if there's a big
 

391
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,770
of each other like if there's a big
slime drowning in the hole another one

392
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:55,780
slime drowning in the hole another one
 

393
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,240
slime drowning in the hole another one
should be able to come in and sink down

394
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,250
should be able to come in and sink down
 

395
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,540
should be able to come in and sink down
on top of it so that this doesn't get

396
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,550
on top of it so that this doesn't get
 

397
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,000
on top of it so that this doesn't get
backed up or anything and then instead

398
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,010
backed up or anything and then instead
 

399
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,250
backed up or anything and then instead
of having like a piston here and one

400
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,260
of having like a piston here and one
 

401
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,440
of having like a piston here and one
over here I decide to do a double piston

402
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,450
over here I decide to do a double piston
 

403
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,810
over here I decide to do a double piston
extender that is joined together kind of

404
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:12,820
extender that is joined together kind of
 

405
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,240
extender that is joined together kind of
so we have one over here and one over

406
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,250
so we have one over here and one over
 

407
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,400
so we have one over here and one over
here and when we power this does this

408
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,410
here and when we power this does this
 

409
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,770
here and when we power this does this
alright so it puts a block right in the

410
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:25,780
alright so it puts a block right in the
 

411
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,110
alright so it puts a block right in the
middle of the 3x3 hole and since a

412
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,120
middle of the 3x3 hole and since a
 

413
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,590
middle of the 3x3 hole and since a
medium and a big slime are bigger than

414
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
medium and a big slime are bigger than
 

415
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,140
medium and a big slime are bigger than
then one block the mediums 1.2 blocks in

416
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,150
then one block the mediums 1.2 blocks in
 

417
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,280
then one block the mediums 1.2 blocks in
size in it a big ones 2.4 so medium

418
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,290
size in it a big ones 2.4 so medium
 

419
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,830
size in it a big ones 2.4 so medium
needs a 2x2 hole basically to fall down

420
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:40,840
needs a 2x2 hole basically to fall down
 

421
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,070
needs a 2x2 hole basically to fall down
and the big one needs a 3x3 so only the

422
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,080
and the big one needs a 3x3 so only the
 

423
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,570
and the big one needs a 3x3 so only the
small ones are going to fall down here

424
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:45,580
small ones are going to fall down here
 

425
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,000
small ones are going to fall down here
if if we have this extended this is like

426
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,010
if if we have this extended this is like
 

427
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,490
if if we have this extended this is like
a a junction in case we want them to go

428
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:50,500
a a junction in case we want them to go
 

429
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,640
a a junction in case we want them to go
up to escalator which at the current

430
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,650
up to escalator which at the current
 

431
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,130
up to escalator which at the current
time I do not want I don't even know why

432
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,140
time I do not want I don't even know why
 

433
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,050
time I do not want I don't even know why
I'm putting it in but you know more

434
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm putting it in but you know more
 

435
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm putting it in but you know more
options better okay and I ran a align

436
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:04,510
options better okay and I ran a align
 

437
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,680
options better okay and I ran a align
wire underneath the water escalator and

438
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:07,690
wire underneath the water escalator and
 

439
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,510
wire underneath the water escalator and
it comes out to here at the moment so we

440
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:09,520
it comes out to here at the moment so we
 

441
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,880
it comes out to here at the moment so we
might put a a lever out here or

442
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:11,890
might put a a lever out here or
 

443
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,480
might put a a lever out here or
something

444
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,490
something
 

445
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,210
something
to to switch the junction and this

446
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:18,220
to to switch the junction and this
 

447
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,460
to to switch the junction and this
should be able to reach good very good I

448
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,470
should be able to reach good very good I
 

449
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,019
should be able to reach good very good I
put a double chest down here to fill up

450
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:25,029
put a double chest down here to fill up
 

451
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,329
put a double chest down here to fill up
with slimeballs

452
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:26,339
with slimeballs
 

453
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,060
with slimeballs
and we're going to do a 3x3 thing of

454
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,070
and we're going to do a 3x3 thing of
 

455
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,360
and we're going to do a 3x3 thing of
hoppers I guess probably the easiest way

456
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,370
hoppers I guess probably the easiest way
 

457
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,820
hoppers I guess probably the easiest way
of doing all this so we'll make them all

458
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:35,830
of doing all this so we'll make them all
 

459
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,340
of doing all this so we'll make them all
go to the double chests and like so can

460
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,350
go to the double chests and like so can
 

461
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:49,220
go to the double chests and like so can
I do this yeah that works okay cool cool

462
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,230
I do this yeah that works okay cool cool
 

463
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,510
I do this yeah that works okay cool cool
let's try not to drop anything and I

464
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,520
let's try not to drop anything and I
 

465
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,340
let's try not to drop anything and I
can't access the chests with that with

466
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,350
can't access the chests with that with
 

467
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,230
can't access the chests with that with
this setup but if it comes to a point

468
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
this setup but if it comes to a point
 

469
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,090
this setup but if it comes to a point
where I want to I'm sure I'll change it

470
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,100
where I want to I'm sure I'll change it
 

471
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,670
where I want to I'm sure I'll change it
around so that it can but I don't really

472
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:02,680
around so that it can but I don't really
 

473
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,380
around so that it can but I don't really
need slimeballs I have over a double

474
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,390
need slimeballs I have over a double

spawning chunk I do not want them
spawning in my wiring here so we're

482
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:16,930
spawning in my wiring here so we're
 

483
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,240
spawning in my wiring here so we're
going to make sure it's only one block

484
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,250
going to make sure it's only one block

489
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:36,480
this is part of the wall fill that back
and they're there all the wiring sealed

490
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,490
and they're there all the wiring sealed
 

491
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,480
and they're there all the wiring sealed
up now let's go try this out so right

492
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,490
up now let's go try this out so right
 

493
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,430
up now let's go try this out so right
now 3x3 hole is open I have a lever just

494
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
now 3x3 hole is open I have a lever just
 

495
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,199
now 3x3 hole is open I have a lever just
out here at the moment which we can move

496
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:46,209
out here at the moment which we can move
 

497
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,360
out here at the moment which we can move
when we figure out what we want to do

498
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,370
when we figure out what we want to do
 

499
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,290
when we figure out what we want to do
but this annexed ends no problem both

500
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,300
but this annexed ends no problem both
 

501
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,870
but this annexed ends no problem both
sides that's good Oh almost fell almost

502
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:57,880
sides that's good Oh almost fell almost
 

503
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,720
sides that's good Oh almost fell almost
fell okay so the last thing we got to do

504
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:00,730
fell okay so the last thing we got to do
 

505
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,060
fell okay so the last thing we got to do
with this is get the water flowing once

506
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,070
with this is get the water flowing once
 

507
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,690
with this is get the water flowing once
again proper way and we are going to

508
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:06,700
again proper way and we are going to
 

509
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,550
again proper way and we are going to
drop these dirt blocks into the hopper

510
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
drop these dirt blocks into the hopper
 

511
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,660
drop these dirt blocks into the hopper
unfortunately but it's only one space we

512
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,670
unfortunately but it's only one space we
 

513
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,940
unfortunately but it's only one space we
lose not a big deal it goes down

514
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:16,950
lose not a big deal it goes down
 

515
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,260
lose not a big deal it goes down
all right so there should be solid water

516
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,270
all right so there should be solid water
 

517
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,440
all right so there should be solid water
now yeah cool

518
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,450
now yeah cool
 

519
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,710
now yeah cool
so the slimes will fall down there and

520
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
so the slimes will fall down there and
 

521
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
so the slimes will fall down there and
if the piston extends it shouldn't be a

522
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,010
if the piston extends it shouldn't be a
 

523
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,140
if the piston extends it shouldn't be a
problem

524
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,150
problem
 

525
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,000
problem
I'm pretty sure in terms of water flow

526
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,010
I'm pretty sure in terms of water flow
 

527
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,530
I'm pretty sure in terms of water flow
and all that stuff I don't think it

528
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:37,540
and all that stuff I don't think it
 

529
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,970
and all that stuff I don't think it
messes it up yeah it's good cool so that

530
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:41,980
messes it up yeah it's good cool so that
 

531
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,670
messes it up yeah it's good cool so that
is our little Junction now for the slime

532
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:44,680
is our little Junction now for the slime
 

533

well that's cool we got another project
done and check it out 30 levels again

538
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,290
done and check it out 30 levels again
 

539
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,640

really use my XP farms anymore just
 

543
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,710
really use my XP farms anymore just
because you get levels so easily now

544
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:01,720
because you get levels so easily now
 

545
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,780
because you get levels so easily now
from other things it's crazy

546
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:03,790
from other things it's crazy

know we'll see what it looks like we've
 

569
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,829
know we'll see what it looks like we've
had glass here forever but I kind of

570
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
had glass here forever but I kind of
 

571
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,730
had glass here forever but I kind of
feel like changing it for some reason

572
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,740
feel like changing it for some reason
 

573
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,780

was worth a try anyways now we know

578
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,410
was worth a try anyways now we know
 

579
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,720
was worth a try anyways now we know
glass is a little bit better so we'll

580
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:00,730
glass is a little bit better so we'll
 

581
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,020
glass is a little bit better so we'll
keep it with like that and check this

582
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,030
keep it with like that and check this
 

583
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,329
keep it with like that and check this
out

the other thing I was considering

592
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:17,500
the other thing I was considering
 

593
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,220
the other thing I was considering
looking into today is the cave spider

594
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,230
looking into today is the cave spider
 

595
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,210
looking into today is the cave spider
spawners so these have been doing

596
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:24,220
spawners so these have been doing
 

597
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,189
spawners so these have been doing
nothing for a long time now they're not

598
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:26,199
nothing for a long time now they're not
 

599
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,130
nothing for a long time now they're not
it does kind of work this this thing

600
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,140
it does kind of work this this thing
 

601
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,540
it does kind of work this this thing
here still

602
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:30,550
here still
 

603
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,050
here still
the T spiders fall like so let they get

604
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,060
the T spiders fall like so let they get
 

605
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,710
the T spiders fall like so let they get
down to one hit kill and then you punch

606
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:37,720
down to one hit kill and then you punch
 

607
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,270
down to one hit kill and then you punch
them to death

608
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
them to death
 

609
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
them to death
it is it does still kind of work it's

610
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:41,770
it is it does still kind of work it's
 

611
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,130
it is it does still kind of work it's
not very well they get stuck in the

612
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,140
not very well they get stuck in the
 

613
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,920
not very well they get stuck in the
water pipes in places and we should try

614
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:49,930
water pipes in places and we should try
 

615
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,600
water pipes in places and we should try
to make use of this because I'm in this

616
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:51,610
to make use of this because I'm in this
 

617
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,810
to make use of this because I'm in this
area a lot and I'm totally out of string

618
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:54,820
area a lot and I'm totally out of string
 

619
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,500
area a lot and I'm totally out of string
pretty much I have only a few stacks in

620
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,510
pretty much I have only a few stacks in
 

621
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,920
pretty much I have only a few stacks in
the past we managed to get so much from

622
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:01,930
the past we managed to get so much from
 

623
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,820
the past we managed to get so much from
those two to spawners like I think all

624
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:05,830
those two to spawners like I think all
 

625
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,340
those two to spawners like I think all
this wall here is from from that string

626
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,350
this wall here is from from that string
 

627
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,650
this wall here is from from that string
then you got a little more there I think

628
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:10,660
then you got a little more there I think
 

629
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,150
then you got a little more there I think
there might even be another double chest

630
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
there might even be another double chest
 

631
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,580
there might even be another double chest
somewhere so we've gotten a lot of

632
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:14,590
somewhere so we've gotten a lot of
 

633
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,930
somewhere so we've gotten a lot of
string out of this thing and we need

634

for this thing I'm going to dig out this
 

641
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,560
for this thing I'm going to dig out this
8 by 8 section all the way down so that

642
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,570
8 by 8 section all the way down so that
 

643
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,420
8 by 8 section all the way down so that
does this fall to their death and then

644
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,430
does this fall to their death and then
 

645
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,530
does this fall to their death and then

649
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,660
hoppers and chests and whatnot we won't
get any spider eyes doing it that way

650

get any spider eyes doing it that way
 

651
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,000
get any spider eyes doing it that way
but I don't mind I just want the string

652
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,010
but I don't mind I just want the string
 

653
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,810

basically and we might try to keep this

654
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:48,820
basically and we might try to keep this
 

655
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,160
basically and we might try to keep this
set up though with the water what I

656
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,170
set up though with the water what I
 

657
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,410
set up though with the water what I
would like to do is put signs under this

658
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:52,420
would like to do is put signs under this
 

659
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,290
would like to do is put signs under this
water and see when they spawn if they

660
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:55,300
water and see when they spawn if they
 

661
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,090
water and see when they spawn if they
will fall through the water or if

662
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,100
will fall through the water or if
 

663
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,670
will fall through the water or if
they'll keep going through the system if

664
00:18:59,670 --> 00:18:59,680
they'll keep going through the system if
 

665
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,130
they'll keep going through the system if
they keep going like if they float on

666
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,140
they keep going like if they float on
 

667
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,830
they keep going like if they float on
the water through this we can have an

668
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:04,840
the water through this we can have an
 

669
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,370
the water through this we can have an
on/off switch for the fall trap - let's

670
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:11,380
on/off switch for the fall trap - let's

we're just testing right now so I just

740
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:05,769
we're just testing right now so I just
 

741
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,039
we're just testing right now so I just
want to make sure they're dying when

742
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,049
want to make sure they're dying when
 

743

they hit the ground here which it looks

744
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:09,580
they hit the ground here which it looks
 

745
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,869
they hit the ground here which it looks
like they are I see string here very

746
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:12,879
like they are I see string here very
 

747

good very good to be honest I'm not sure

748
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:17,649
good very good to be honest I'm not sure
 

749
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,919

if they died like if you have fences and

750
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:19,929
if they died like if you have fences and
 

751
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,129
if they died like if you have fences and
water above if they'll die on that I

752
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:22,139
water above if they'll die on that I
 

753
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:26,430
water above if they'll die on that I
think they did before but I should

754
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:26,440
think they did before but I should
 

755
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,109
think they did before but I should
probably try it out again that's that's

756
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:28,119
probably try it out again that's that's
 

757
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,230
probably try it out again that's that's
probably what I'll do if that works and

758
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,240
probably what I'll do if that works and
 

759
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,350
probably what I'll do if that works and
we can just have all that items flow

760
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,360
we can just have all that items flow
 

761
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,780
we can just have all that items flow
to one spot pretty easily and it'll go

762
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:36,790
to one spot pretty easily and it'll go
 

763
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,870
to one spot pretty easily and it'll go
into one hopper I figured it'd be a lot

764
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
into one hopper I figured it'd be a lot
 

765
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,940
into one hopper I figured it'd be a lot
quicker just to go into a creative world

766
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:44,950
quicker just to go into a creative world
 

767
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,600
quicker just to go into a creative world
here and check it out and it looks like

768
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:47,610
here and check it out and it looks like
 

769
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,030
here and check it out and it looks like
they survived which is sort of as a

long time ago that did this and it would

774
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:56,500
long time ago that did this and it would
 

775
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,010
long time ago that did this and it would
kill them but obviously water has

776
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,020
kill them but obviously water has
 

777
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,860
kill them but obviously water has
changed where no matter how deep it is

778
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:01,870
changed where no matter how deep it is

it hmm
so how should we do the floor in here

784
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
so how should we do the floor in here
 

785
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,060
so how should we do the floor in here
then like if we drop them on hoppers

786
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,070
then like if we drop them on hoppers
 

787
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,430
then like if we drop them on hoppers
that would work really well but it would

788
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,440
that would work really well but it would
 

789
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,330
that would work really well but it would
take 64 hoppers to cover the whole floor

790
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:17,340
take 64 hoppers to cover the whole floor
 

791
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,430
take 64 hoppers to cover the whole floor
we could also set up minecart tracks and

792
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:20,440
we could also set up minecart tracks and
 

793
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,770
we could also set up minecart tracks and
have a hopper cart go by every so often

794
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:22,780
have a hopper cart go by every so often
 

795
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,240
have a hopper cart go by every so often
pick up stuff or we could have ice and

796
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,250
pick up stuff or we could have ice and
 

797
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,910
pick up stuff or we could have ice and
ice floor and like a water stream that

798
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:29,920
ice floor and like a water stream that
 

799
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,460
ice floor and like a water stream that
pushes stuff every few minutes

800
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,470
pushes stuff every few minutes
 

801
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,320
pushes stuff every few minutes
um I'm not too sure in terms of lag and

802
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,330
um I'm not too sure in terms of lag and
 

803
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,080
um I'm not too sure in terms of lag and
stuff I think 64 hoppers on the ground

804
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,090
stuff I think 64 hoppers on the ground
 

805
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,120
stuff I think 64 hoppers on the ground
would probably be the best way of doing

806
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,130
would probably be the best way of doing
 

807
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,450
would probably be the best way of doing
it because water updates cause a lot of

808
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:45,460
it because water updates cause a lot of
 

809
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,450
it because water updates cause a lot of
lag

810
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:47,460
lag
 

811
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,220
lag
although the hopper minecart might be a

812
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,230
although the hopper minecart might be a
 

813
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,520
although the hopper minecart might be a
good way of doing it - well I'll think

814
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:53,530
good way of doing it - well I'll think
 

815
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:53,970
good way of doing it - well I'll think
about it

816
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:53,980
about it
 

817
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,860
about it
you guys have much suggestions let me

818
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,870
you guys have much suggestions let me
 

819
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,210
you guys have much suggestions let me
know and let's go check out the lab

820
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:00,220
know and let's go check out the lab
 

821
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,800
know and let's go check out the lab
that's another thing I wanted to do

822
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:01,810
that's another thing I wanted to do
 

823

today
I've been working on it a lot and it's

826
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:05,380
I've been working on it a lot and it's
 

827

the Redstone on it - there's just a few

832
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,030
the Redstone on it - there's just a few
 

833
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,910
the Redstone on it - there's just a few
little details like this door needs to

834
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:17,920
little details like this door needs to
 

835
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,790
little details like this door needs to
be done like I need a proper trigger for

836
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:20,800
be done like I need a proper trigger for
 

837
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,420
be done like I need a proper trigger for
this this is where all the slimes are

838
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,430
this this is where all the slimes are
 

839
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:31,740

now great jokes with this door I want
like a Secrets trigger to open it I

842
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:34,420
like a Secrets trigger to open it I
 

843
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,170
like a Secrets trigger to open it I
don't want like a a button or something

844

I don't think

846
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:40,990

 

847
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,320

I'm not sure what I want to do yet

848
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,330
I'm not sure what I want to do yet
 

849
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm not sure what I want to do yet
something something cool hopefully and I

850
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
something something cool hopefully and I
 

851
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,620
something something cool hopefully and I
did the back of the lamp here now and I

852
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:50,630
did the back of the lamp here now and I
 

853
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,290
did the back of the lamp here now and I
counted it out and it worked out

854
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:52,300
counted it out and it worked out
 

855
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,990
counted it out and it worked out
perfectly so that's the last remaining

856
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
perfectly so that's the last remaining
 

857
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,880
perfectly so that's the last remaining
ones of these we needed filled up the

858
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:57,890
ones of these we needed filled up the
 

859
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,250
ones of these we needed filled up the
rest of the space so I decided let's

860
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,260
rest of the space so I decided let's
 

861
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,230
rest of the space so I decided let's
just continue with with this wall look

862
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
just continue with with this wall look
 

863
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,180
just continue with with this wall look
and make it meet up here and we'll have

864
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,190
and make it meet up here and we'll have
 

865
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,690
and make it meet up here and we'll have
another door or entranceway or exit way

866
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:07,700
another door or entranceway or exit way
 

867
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,390
another door or entranceway or exit way
here that will let us walk through the

868
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
here that will let us walk through the
 

869
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
here that will let us walk through the
lab to a new room like it another room

870
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,130
lab to a new room like it another room
 

871
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,970
lab to a new room like it another room
over here and we'll do something with

872
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:15,980
over here and we'll do something with
 

873
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,770
over here and we'll do something with
the skeleton spawner over here I'm sure

874
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:17,780
the skeleton spawner over here I'm sure
 

875
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,930
the skeleton spawner over here I'm sure
and continue through with the lab I

876
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:22,940
and continue through with the lab I
 

877
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,730
and continue through with the lab I
don't want it like this the dead end or

878
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:24,740
don't want it like this the dead end or
 

879
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,410
don't want it like this the dead end or
anything either so this works oh good

880
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,420
anything either so this works oh good
 

881
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,210
anything either so this works oh good

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:41,900
do a few more things with it and we'll
 

891
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,770
do a few more things with it and we'll
be able to fire it up but pretty cool

892
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:46,780
be able to fire it up but pretty cool
 

893
