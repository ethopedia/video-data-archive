maybe we'll go back at least one more
block

134
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
block
 

135
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,949
block
we'll have them have one like right here

136
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
we'll have them have one like right here
 

137

00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
and they should be able to breed through
 

141
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,589
and they should be able to breed through
the one block distance there

142
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
the one block distance there
 

143
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,910
the one block distance there
and then we have to hook up a mine cart

144
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
and then we have to hook up a mine cart
 

145
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,430
and then we have to hook up a mine cart
to

146
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
to
 

147
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,350
to
pick up the sheep bring them to the

148
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
pick up the sheep bring them to the
 

149
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,550
pick up the sheep bring them to the
middle here and when we

150
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
middle here and when we
 

151
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,470
middle here and when we
hop in the minecart or break it then

152
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
hop in the minecart or break it then
 

153
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,830
hop in the minecart or break it then
we'll have another sheep

154
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
we'll have another sheep
 

155
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,390
we'll have another sheep
running around here which we can move

156
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
running around here which we can move
 

157
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,990
running around here which we can move
wherever we need them

158
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
wherever we need them
 

159
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,550
wherever we need them
so that's the plan

160
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
so that's the plan
 

161
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,670
so that's the plan
so yeah glass glass display will

162
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
so yeah glass glass display will
 

163
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,030
so yeah glass glass display will
probably be right

164
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
probably be right
 

165
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,750
probably be right
there it's a good height for it

166
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760

 

167
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,949

how's this gonna work

168
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
how's this gonna work
 

169
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,630
how's this gonna work
also with the water coming down we can't

170
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
also with the water coming down we can't
 

171
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,149
also with the water coming down we can't
have any tracks

172
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
have any tracks
 

173
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,229
have any tracks
at this level so i might have to raise

174
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
at this level so i might have to raise
 

175
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,070
at this level so i might have to raise
this one

176
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080

 

177
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,070

well i'll think about it a little bit

178
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
well i'll think about it a little bit
 

179
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,190
well i'll think about it a little bit
and maybe get started and then

180
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
and maybe get started and then
 

181
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,030
and maybe get started and then
we'll continue on

182
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040

 

183
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,630

now we're gonna try something here i

184
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
now we're gonna try something here i
 

185
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,949
now we're gonna try something here i
don't really expect this to work but if

186
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
don't really expect this to work but if
 

187
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,229
don't really expect this to work but if
it does

188
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
it does
 

189
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,789
it does
awesome because it'll be very simple i

190
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
awesome because it'll be very simple i
 

191
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,390
awesome because it'll be very simple i
got two sheep over here

192
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
got two sheep over here
 

193
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,349
got two sheep over here
i i leered them with the wheat uh we can

194
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
i i leered them with the wheat uh we can
 

195
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,710
i i leered them with the wheat uh we can
breed them if we leave this open

196
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
breed them if we leave this open
 

197
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,030
breed them if we leave this open
i believe yep a little bit difficult too

198
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
i believe yep a little bit difficult too
 

199
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,510
i believe yep a little bit difficult too
and they should pop okay so he pops into

200
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
and they should pop okay so he pops into
 

201
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,070
and they should pop okay so he pops into
that one

202
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
that one
 

203
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,390
that one
every time i breed them they'll pop into

204
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
every time i breed them they'll pop into
 

205
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,670
every time i breed them they'll pop into
that one

206
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
that one
 

207
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,590
that one
the little sheep have this are the exact

208
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
the little sheep have this are the exact
 

209
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,469
the little sheep have this are the exact
same size as the

210
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
same size as the
 

211
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,550
same size as the
the big guys though so it's not like

212
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
the big guys though so it's not like
 

213
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,230
the big guys though so it's not like
they can fit through the one block

214
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
they can fit through the one block
 

215
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,990
they can fit through the one block
high adapter there's still a block and a

216
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
high adapter there's still a block and a
 

217
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,230
high adapter there's still a block and a
half or whatever it is

218
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
half or whatever it is
 

219
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,830
half or whatever it is
i believe it's a block and a half and

220
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840

 

221
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,189

um we'll just put i'm just going to try

222
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
um we'll just put i'm just going to try
 

223
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,550
um we'll just put i'm just going to try
this

224
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
this
 

225
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,590
this
put that there get some more light put a

226
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
put that there get some more light put a
 

227
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,510
put that there get some more light put a
block back there

228
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520

 

229
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,270

rail

230
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280

 

231
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,430

um well let's make it let's make it

232
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
um well let's make it let's make it
 

233
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,990
um well let's make it let's make it
point the correct way at least

234
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000

 

235
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,670

so if i put a minecart here i want to

236
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
so if i put a minecart here i want to
 

237
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,590
so if i put a minecart here i want to
see if it'll pick up the sheep from the

238
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
see if it'll pick up the sheep from the
 

239
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,790
see if it'll pick up the sheep from the
left here or if it's

240
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
left here or if it's
 

241
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,270
left here or if it's
just it'll or if it'll be different

242
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
just it'll or if it'll be different
 

243
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,909
just it'll or if it'll be different
every time or what's going to happen

244
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919

 

245
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,150

i picked up the little guy that's that's

246
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
i picked up the little guy that's that's
 

247
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,950
i picked up the little guy that's that's
pretty cool

248
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
pretty cool
 

249
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,909
pretty cool
sorry guy

250
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919

 

251
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,670

i might try this a few more times

252
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
i might try this a few more times
 

253
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,189
i might try this a few more times
because if that can work consistently

254
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
because if that can work consistently
 

255
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,189
because if that can work consistently
that would be a really easy way of doing

256
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
that would be a really easy way of doing
 

257
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,310
that would be a really easy way of doing
this

258
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320

 

259
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,830

okay um maybe we'll go do something

260
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
okay um maybe we'll go do something
 

261
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,430
okay um maybe we'll go do something
else while i wait for them to breed

262
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
else while i wait for them to breed
 

263
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,189
else while i wait for them to breed
again

264
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199

 

265
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,870

yeah i'm gonna work on this uh in

266
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
yeah i'm gonna work on this uh in
 

267
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,629
yeah i'm gonna work on this uh in
between while we wait for them to breed

268
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
between while we wait for them to breed
 

269
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,749
between while we wait for them to breed
a few more times

270
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
a few more times
 

271
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,309
a few more times
um i said i want to make this pop up

272
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
um i said i want to make this pop up
 

273
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,189
um i said i want to make this pop up
when the water

274
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
when the water
 

275
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,870
when the water
flows down but the issue is i can't just

276
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
flows down but the issue is i can't just
 

277
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,990
flows down but the issue is i can't just
simply hook this button up to

278
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
simply hook this button up to
 

279
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,430
simply hook this button up to
up to the redstone here because if i do

280
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
up to the redstone here because if i do
 

281
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,670
up to the redstone here because if i do
that when i press it

282
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
that when i press it
 

283
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,670
that when i press it
it'll come up but it'll go down in one

284
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
it'll come up but it'll go down in one
 

285
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,510
it'll come up but it'll go down in one
second so

286
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
second so
 

287
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,270
second so
by the time the water hits the ground

288
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
by the time the water hits the ground
 

289
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,830
by the time the water hits the ground
it's already down and does nothing

290
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
it's already down and does nothing
 

291
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,870
it's already down and does nothing
we need it to stay up for a long a long

292
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
we need it to stay up for a long a long
 

293
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,550
we need it to stay up for a long a long
time until all the water disappears

294
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
time until all the water disappears
 

295
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,270
time until all the water disappears
which will be at least i think it's at

296
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
which will be at least i think it's at
 

297
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,390
which will be at least i think it's at
least 10 seconds

298
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
least 10 seconds
 

299
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,790
least 10 seconds
15 seconds not an easy thing to do

300
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
15 seconds not an easy thing to do
 

301
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,909
15 seconds not an easy thing to do
i need a pulse extender for that the

302
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
i need a pulse extender for that the
 

303
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,189
i need a pulse extender for that the
issue

304
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
issue
 

305
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,710
issue
though is our delay

306
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
though is our delay
 

307
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,830
though is our delay
system is all the way at the other end

308
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

309
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,309

here

310
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
here
 

311
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,029
here
so what i could do is make another one

312
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
so what i could do is make another one
 

313
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,830
so what i could do is make another one
at this side

314
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
at this side
 

315
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,110
at this side
but big waste of repeaters

316
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
but big waste of repeaters
 

317
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,870
but big waste of repeaters
um and as the power goes through that

318
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
um and as the power goes through that
 

319
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,029
um and as the power goes through that
it's not a pulse extender it's just

320
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
it's not a pulse extender it's just
 

321
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,990
it's not a pulse extender it's just
a long delay on the pulse it still would

322
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
a long delay on the pulse it still would
 

323
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,710
a long delay on the pulse it still would
only be one second

324
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
only be one second
 

325
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,070
only be one second
um i would like i

326
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
um i would like i
 

327
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,469
um i would like i
could possibly do a t flip-flop i'll

328
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
could possibly do a t flip-flop i'll
 

329
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,510
could possibly do a t flip-flop i'll
have to think about it

330
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
have to think about it
 

331
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,710
have to think about it
for a bit but when i'm

332
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
for a bit but when i'm
 

333
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,710
for a bit but when i'm
what i kind of want to try to do is hook

334
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
what i kind of want to try to do is hook
 

335
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,870
what i kind of want to try to do is hook
up a bud switch here that will detect

336
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
up a bud switch here that will detect
 

337
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,550
up a bud switch here that will detect
when the water

338
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
when the water
 

339
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,550
when the water
uh disappears and then cause that to

340
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
uh disappears and then cause that to
 

341
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,110
uh disappears and then cause that to
switch back

342
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
switch back
 

343
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,670
switch back
so i'll just mess around with it a bit

344
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
so i'll just mess around with it a bit
 

345
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,589
so i'll just mess around with it a bit
see what happens

346
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599

 

347
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,749

so i thought about it for a little bit

348
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
so i thought about it for a little bit
 

349
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,350
so i thought about it for a little bit
here and i believe

350
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
here and i believe
 

351
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,670
here and i believe
the easiest and simplest thing we could

352
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
the easiest and simplest thing we could
 

353
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,270
the easiest and simplest thing we could
do is hook this up to

354
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
do is hook this up to
 

355
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,869
do is hook this up to
an rs or latch with the little delay

356
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879

 

357
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,909

we'll put it over here

358
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919

 

359
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,230

somewhere and then

360
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240

 

361
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,550

and then we'll also run

362
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
and then we'll also run
 

363
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,230
and then we'll also run
this wire here down to the other side of

364
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
this wire here down to the other side of
 

365
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,110
this wire here down to the other side of
the rsnor latch to shut it off

366
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
the rsnor latch to shut it off
 

367
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,749
the rsnor latch to shut it off
but we'll have to add a few seconds

368
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
but we'll have to add a few seconds
 

369
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,550
but we'll have to add a few seconds
delay not

370
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
delay not
 

371
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,869
delay not
not too much just enough to give the

372
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
not too much just enough to give the
 

373
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,990
not too much just enough to give the
water time to

374
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
water time to
 

375
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,710
water time to
dissipate after after these come back

376
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
dissipate after after these come back
 

377
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,909
dissipate after after these come back
down

378
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
down
 

379
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,749
down
and yeah that's all we really need

380
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
and yeah that's all we really need
 

381
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,110
and yeah that's all we really need
okay they are there look at that sheep

382
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
okay they are there look at that sheep
 

383
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,510
okay they are there look at that sheep
no sheep sheep no sheep i thought they

384
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
no sheep sheep no sheep i thought they
 

385
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,270
no sheep sheep no sheep i thought they
had died

386
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
had died
 

387
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,670
had died
i was worried uh might be breeding time

388
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680

 

389
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,389

how long did it take me to think i went

390
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
how long did it take me to think i went
 

391
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,790
how long did it take me to think i went
to the bathroom too

392
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800

 

393
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,070

nope not ready

394
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080

 

395
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,910

all right so i've been doing the wiring

396
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
all right so i've been doing the wiring
 

397
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,509
all right so i've been doing the wiring
that's almost done uh let's

398
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
that's almost done uh let's
 

399
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,150
that's almost done uh let's
let's try this reading out again though

400
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160

 

401
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,310

a couple more times make sure it works i

402
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
a couple more times make sure it works i
 

403
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,389
a couple more times make sure it works i
logged out of my world and logged back

404
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
logged out of my world and logged back
 

405
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,829
logged out of my world and logged back
in just to see if that would have an

406
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
in just to see if that would have an
 

407
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,470
in just to see if that would have an
effect this time

408
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480

 

409
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,509

yeah i gotta i gotta raise these guys up

410
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
yeah i gotta i gotta raise these guys up
 

411
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,790
yeah i gotta i gotta raise these guys up
one more block

412
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
one more block
 

413
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,070
one more block
make it easier oh yeah let's take this

414
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
make it easier oh yeah let's take this
 

415
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,070
make it easier oh yeah let's take this
out too

416
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
out too
 

417
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,150
out too
little sheep is oh

418
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
little sheep is oh
 

419
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,910
little sheep is oh
see i always thought they uh came out of

420
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
see i always thought they uh came out of
 

421
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,350
see i always thought they uh came out of
the same one every time

422
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
the same one every time
 

423
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,070
the same one every time
based on the coordinates

424
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080

 

425
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,829

i'll have to watch it again maybe it's

426
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
i'll have to watch it again maybe it's
 

427
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,470
i'll have to watch it again maybe it's
whoever you fed first

428
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
whoever you fed first
 

429
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,630
whoever you fed first
got the little guy again great

430
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640

 

431
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,750

good job okay i'm gonna work on that

432
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
good job okay i'm gonna work on that
 

433
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,030
good job okay i'm gonna work on that
some more we'll probably do this at

434
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
some more we'll probably do this at
 

435
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,949
some more we'll probably do this at
least one more time

436
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
least one more time
 

437
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,630
least one more time
maybe i'll try nudging them next time

438
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
maybe i'll try nudging them next time
 

439
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,550
maybe i'll try nudging them next time
too see if changing their position

440
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
too see if changing their position
 

441
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,269
too see if changing their position
affects things

442
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
affects things
 

443
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,870
affects things
and that will lead you to the hole

444
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880

 

445
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,389

right on okay let's try out these

446
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
right on okay let's try out these
 

447
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,110
right on okay let's try out these
buttons again i got them wired now

448
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
buttons again i got them wired now
 

449
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,990
buttons again i got them wired now
first test here this one is for the

450
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
first test here this one is for the
 

451
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,230
first test here this one is for the
manual reset and this one is for the

452
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
manual reset and this one is for the
 

453
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,110
manual reset and this one is for the
water system

454
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
water system
 

455
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,310
water system
the auto auto reset thing

456
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
the auto auto reset thing
 

457
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,150
the auto auto reset thing
and it goes up here and then goes down

458
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
and it goes up here and then goes down
 

459
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,990
and it goes up here and then goes down
the delays at the back and then it comes

460
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
the delays at the back and then it comes
 

461
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,269
the delays at the back and then it comes
back

462
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
back
 

463
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,790
back
and while that's going on it's also

464
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
and while that's going on it's also
 

465
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,590
and while that's going on it's also
going to go down here now

466
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
going to go down here now
 

467
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,230
going to go down here now
and that connects to these repeaters

468
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240

 

469
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,590

and built into this is an rsnor latch

470
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
and built into this is an rsnor latch
 

471
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,030
and built into this is an rsnor latch
right here so it switches it

472
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
right here so it switches it
 

473
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,310
right here so it switches it
switches this to on and stays on

474
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
switches this to on and stays on
 

475
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,550
switches this to on and stays on
and then it comes

476
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
and then it comes
 

477
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,110
and then it comes
well we gotta go up here

478
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
well we gotta go up here
 

479
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,269
well we gotta go up here
comes back down this line with the delay

480
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
comes back down this line with the delay
 

481
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,030
comes back down this line with the delay
goes to here and i just have it

482
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
goes to here and i just have it
 

483
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,389
goes to here and i just have it
branching down

484
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
branching down
 

485
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,910
branching down
a little bit sloppy but it it'll work

486
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
a little bit sloppy but it it'll work
 

487
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,949
a little bit sloppy but it it'll work
to here than there

488
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
to here than there
 

489
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,550
to here than there
down and two repeaters i'm guessing it's

490
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
down and two repeaters i'm guessing it's
 

491
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,150
down and two repeaters i'm guessing it's
not going to be long enough and if

492
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
not going to be long enough and if
 

493
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,750
not going to be long enough and if
if it's not i'll i'll redo that wiring

494
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
if it's not i'll i'll redo that wiring
 

495
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,190
if it's not i'll i'll redo that wiring
voice crack whoa redo that wiring and

496
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
voice crack whoa redo that wiring and
 

497
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,230
voice crack whoa redo that wiring and
make it longer but we'll see how this

498
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
make it longer but we'll see how this
 

499
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,310
make it longer but we'll see how this
goes

500
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
goes
 

501
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,069
goes
got a little protector here

502
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079

 

503
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,829

i'm yeah it's it's not gonna be long

504
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
i'm yeah it's it's not gonna be long
 

505
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,110
i'm yeah it's it's not gonna be long
enough oh pretty close

506
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
enough oh pretty close
 

507
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,269
enough oh pretty close
pretty close

508
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279

 

509
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,110

um that might work let's try this again

510
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120

 

511
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,470

and i think our sheep are ready for

512
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
and i think our sheep are ready for
 

513
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,509
and i think our sheep are ready for
another go

514
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519

 

515
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,949

yeah that that'll work um

516
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
yeah that that'll work um
 

517
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,829
yeah that that'll work um
let's try the manual resets

518
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839

 

519
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,829

excellent

520
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
excellent
 

521
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,269
excellent
you know what we can actually put some

522
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
you know what we can actually put some
 

523
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,230
you know what we can actually put some
repeaters up here too

524
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
repeaters up here too
 

525
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,230
repeaters up here too
so we'll put one here that'll make it

526
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
so we'll put one here that'll make it
 

527
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,829
so we'll put one here that'll make it
three

528
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
three
 

529
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,750
three
and that'll definitely be long enough

530
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
and that'll definitely be long enough
 

531
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,230
and that'll definitely be long enough
now for the water

532
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240

 

533
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,069

let's go try this one more time if it

534
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
let's go try this one more time if it
 

535
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,110
let's go try this one more time if it
works again

536
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
works again
 

537
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,509
works again
i'll probably finalize this

538
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519

 

539
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,509

okay so we'll get our wheat

540
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519

 

541
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,190

so we picked up the little guy two times

542
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
so we picked up the little guy two times
 

543
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,590
so we picked up the little guy two times
in a row

544
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600

 

545
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,350

oh yeah i was supposed to nudge him oh

546
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
oh yeah i was supposed to nudge him oh
 

547
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,590
oh yeah i was supposed to nudge him oh
well so we went on the right side this

548
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
well so we went on the right side this
 

549
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,350
well so we went on the right side this
this time and again we got the little

550
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
this time and again we got the little
 

551
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,829
this time and again we got the little
one

552
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
one
 

553
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,110
one
excellent so

554
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120

 

555
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,710

i'll probably raise them one block

556
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
i'll probably raise them one block
 

557
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,750
i'll probably raise them one block
um

558
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760

 

559
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,430

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760

 

619
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,870

found it it's uh this block here is

and there's a cobble block there that i
 

921
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,310
and there's a cobble block there that i
missed

929
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,990

but other than that this sheep farm is

930
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
but other than that this sheep farm is
 

931
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,269
but other than that this sheep farm is
done

932
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
done
 

933
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,310
done
for the most part we

934
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
for the most part we
 

935
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,590
for the most part we
will have to wait till 1.3 to get ice

936
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
will have to wait till 1.3 to get ice
 

937
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,630
will have to wait till 1.3 to get ice
for the collection system but this is

for the collection system but this is
all we can do

940
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
all we can do
 

941
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,269
all we can do

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,630
until then and of course this will be
covered up and whatnot but

944
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
covered up and whatnot but
 

945
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,950
