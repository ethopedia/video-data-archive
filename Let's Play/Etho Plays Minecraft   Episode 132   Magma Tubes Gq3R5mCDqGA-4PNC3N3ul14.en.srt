greetings everyone welcome back to
another let's play episode

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
another let's play episode
 

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,350
another let's play episode
i've been spending most of my time in

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
i've been spending most of my time in
 

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,950
i've been spending most of my time in
the nether

10
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
the nether
 

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,870
the nether
since last episode working on this area

12
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
since last episode working on this area
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,550
since last episode working on this area
working on these blaze spawners here

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
working on these blaze spawners here
 

15
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,230
working on these blaze spawners here
and they're getting done i was just

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
and they're getting done i was just
 

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,990
and they're getting done i was just
starting the wiring on this one

18
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
starting the wiring on this one
 

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,669
starting the wiring on this one
and i kind of had a change of plans

20
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
and i kind of had a change of plans
 

21
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,269
and i kind of had a change of plans
but we'll get to that in a sec you can

22
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
but we'll get to that in a sec you can
 

23
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,430
but we'll get to that in a sec you can
see i got the

24
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
see i got the
 

25
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,229
see i got the
the blaze shut off set up now so i can

26
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
the blaze shut off set up now so i can
 

27
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:36,790
the blaze shut off set up now so i can
turn them

28
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
turn them
 

29
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,350
turn them
on or off using this lava pouring down

30
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
on or off using this lava pouring down
 

31
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,790
on or off using this lava pouring down
and you've seen how to set this up

32
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
and you've seen how to set this up
 

33
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,670
and you've seen how to set this up
before in the tutorial in in previous lp

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
before in the tutorial in in previous lp
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,430
before in the tutorial in in previous lp
episodes so

36
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
episodes so
 

37
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,549
episodes so
it's pretty basic simple wiring and

38
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
it's pretty basic simple wiring and
 

39
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,510
it's pretty basic simple wiring and
everything

40
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520

 

41
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,110

but yeah what i want to do with this

42
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
but yeah what i want to do with this
 

43
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,470
but yeah what i want to do with this
area it keeps changing

44
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
area it keeps changing
 

45
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,310
area it keeps changing
i have a hard time making up my mind on

46
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
i have a hard time making up my mind on
 

47
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,750
i have a hard time making up my mind on
certain things so

48
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
certain things so
 

49
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,830
certain things so
that's just the way i am i was doing the

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
that's just the way i am i was doing the
 

51
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,429
that's just the way i am i was doing the
wiring and it's like i don't want to do

52
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
wiring and it's like i don't want to do
 

53
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,750
wiring and it's like i don't want to do
this anymore

54
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
this anymore
 

55
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,590
this anymore
so i kind of stopped and thought about

56
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
so i kind of stopped and thought about
 

57
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,870
so i kind of stopped and thought about
it for a bit

58
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
it for a bit
 

59
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,749
it for a bit
originally when i started this people i

60
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
originally when i started this people i
 

61
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,710
originally when i started this people i
i was kind of

62
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
i was kind of
 

63
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,310
i was kind of
had to choose between combining

64
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
had to choose between combining
 

65
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,230
had to choose between combining
two blaze spawners into one farm or

66
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
two blaze spawners into one farm or
 

67
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,990
two blaze spawners into one farm or
separating them like i have here and i

68
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
separating them like i have here and i
 

69
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,390
separating them like i have here and i
chose to separate them because i like

70
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
chose to separate them because i like
 

71
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,830
chose to separate them because i like
the looking

72
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
the looking
 

73
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,510
the looking
i thought it would just be better but

74
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
i thought it would just be better but
 

75
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,270
i thought it would just be better but
a lot of you guys wanted me to put them

76
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
a lot of you guys wanted me to put them
 

77
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,749
a lot of you guys wanted me to put them
together and

78
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
together and
 

79
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,670
together and
thinking about it more i probably should

80
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
thinking about it more i probably should
 

81
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,590
thinking about it more i probably should
combine the two because it's gonna get

82
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
combine the two because it's gonna get
 

83
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,030
combine the two because it's gonna get
annoying

84
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
annoying
 

85
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,270
annoying
having to go to this one kill the blaze

86
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
having to go to this one kill the blaze
 

87
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,429
having to go to this one kill the blaze
and then go into this one to kill them

88
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
and then go into this one to kill them
 

89
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,190
and then go into this one to kill them
they really should be together the

90
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
they really should be together the
 

91
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,030
they really should be together the
holding areas

92
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
holding areas
 

93
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,069
holding areas
so that's what i'll do it's also playing

94
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
so that's what i'll do it's also playing
 

95
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,590
so that's what i'll do it's also playing
with the design here but i'm going to be

96
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
with the design here but i'm going to be
 

97
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,550
with the design here but i'm going to be
tearing this all out

98
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560

 

99
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,030

but instead of combining the two blaze

100
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
but instead of combining the two blaze
 

101
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,350
but instead of combining the two blaze
farms together like at the top there

102
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
farms together like at the top there
 

103
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,950
farms together like at the top there
i'm going to keep them the way they are

104
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
i'm going to keep them the way they are
 

105
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,630
i'm going to keep them the way they are
here and i'm

106
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
here and i'm
 

107
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,710
here and i'm
going to make the blaze fall down into

108
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
going to make the blaze fall down into
 

109
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,150
going to make the blaze fall down into
lava

110
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
lava
 

111
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,270
lava
so give me a moment as i

112
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
so give me a moment as i
 

113
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,949
so give me a moment as i
demolish a lot of this stuff i'm gonna

114
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
demolish a lot of this stuff i'm gonna
 

115
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,949
demolish a lot of this stuff i'm gonna
get rid of all this wiring

116
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
get rid of all this wiring
 

117
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,830
get rid of all this wiring
and get rid of all these lower pistons

118
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

119
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,150

here

120
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
here
 

121
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,710
here
and this thing here is probably going to

122
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
and this thing here is probably going to
 

123
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,670
and this thing here is probably going to
go

124
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
go
 

125
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,229
go
and then i'll then i'll be back

126
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239

 

127
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,910

all right so i got that all taken care

128
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
all right so i got that all taken care
 

129
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,550
all right so i got that all taken care
of i'm going to be using this blaze farm

130
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
of i'm going to be using this blaze farm
 

131
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,390
of i'm going to be using this blaze farm
a lot in the future so i want to make

132
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
a lot in the future so i want to make
 

133
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,670
a lot in the future so i want to make
sure

134
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
sure
 

135
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,309
sure
i'm really happy with this area when

136
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
i'm really happy with this area when
 

137
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,309
i'm really happy with this area when
it's all done

138
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
it's all done
 

139
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,390
it's all done
because i'll be using a lot and chanting

140
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
because i'll be using a lot and chanting
 

141
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,070
because i'll be using a lot and chanting
is a big part of the game now

142
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
is a big part of the game now
 

143
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,150
is a big part of the game now
it's a fun part of the game in most

144
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
it's a fun part of the game in most
 

145
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,589
it's a fun part of the game in most
aspects

146
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
aspects
 

147
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,830
aspects
and having efficiency tools just will

148
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
and having efficiency tools just will
 

149
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,190
and having efficiency tools just will
speed every

150
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
speed every
 

151
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,070
speed every
every project i do up

152
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080

 

153
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,750

so i want to make sure i have good

154
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
so i want to make sure i have good
 

155
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,949
so i want to make sure i have good
enchanted tools

156
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959

 

157
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,229

and a good a good xp farm so that's uh

158
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
and a good a good xp farm so that's uh
 

159
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,509
and a good a good xp farm so that's uh
that's why i'm giving this a lot of

160
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
that's why i'm giving this a lot of
 

161
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,030
that's why i'm giving this a lot of
attention

162
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
attention
 

163
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,630
attention
so we will be using

164
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
so we will be using
 

165
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,670
so we will be using
lava much like we use water in other mob

166
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
lava much like we use water in other mob
 

167
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,750
lava much like we use water in other mob
systems

168
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
systems
 

169
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,149
systems
mobs they don't burn in lava so we can

170
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
mobs they don't burn in lava so we can
 

171
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,949
mobs they don't burn in lava so we can
use it

172
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
use it
 

173
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,070
use it
to move them around the one thing we got

174
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
to move them around the one thing we got
 

175
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,789
to move them around the one thing we got
to be really careful about here though

176
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
to be really careful about here though
 

177
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,110
to be really careful about here though
uh let's go up lava emits light

178
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
uh let's go up lava emits light
 

179
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,390
uh let's go up lava emits light
so we can't let light into the spawning

180
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
so we can't let light into the spawning
 

181
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,030
so we can't let light into the spawning
area or it'll lower the spawning rates

182
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
area or it'll lower the spawning rates
 

183
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,030
area or it'll lower the spawning rates
or completely shut it down like you can

184
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
or completely shut it down like you can
 

185
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,589
or completely shut it down like you can
see here the lava is preventing

186
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
see here the lava is preventing
 

187
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,229
see here the lava is preventing
spawning because of the light so

188
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
spawning because of the light so
 

189
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,710
spawning because of the light so
at this level here the one block below

190
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
at this level here the one block below
 

191
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,750
at this level here the one block below
the spawner

192
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
the spawner
 

193
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,710
the spawner
is where mobs can spawn so we need this

194
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
is where mobs can spawn so we need this
 

195
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,429
is where mobs can spawn so we need this
at light level

196
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
at light level
 

197
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,030
at light level
zero at this height but

198
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040

 

199
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,789

anything below that can be whatever

200
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
anything below that can be whatever
 

201
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,949
anything below that can be whatever
light level we want so

202
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
light level we want so
 

203
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,509
light level we want so
we'll want to count 15 blocks below this

204
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
we'll want to count 15 blocks below this
 

205
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,309
we'll want to count 15 blocks below this
so one

206
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
so one
 

207
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,750
so one
two because lava has a light level of

208
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
two because lava has a light level of
 

209
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,470
two because lava has a light level of
15.

210
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
15.
 

211
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,589
15.
so one two three

212
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
so one two three
 

213
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,349
so one two three
four five

214
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359

 

215
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,069

uh wait a sec one two three four five

216
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
uh wait a sec one two three four five
 

217
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,710
uh wait a sec one two three four five
six

218
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
six
 

219
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,390
six
seven eight nine at the glass here

220
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
seven eight nine at the glass here
 

221
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,469
seven eight nine at the glass here
10 11 12.

222
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
10 11 12.
 

223
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,749
10 11 12.
13 14 15

224
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
13 14 15
 

225
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,469
13 14 15
so at this level here is where the lava

226
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
so at this level here is where the lava
 

227
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,270
so at this level here is where the lava
needs to be

228
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280

 

229
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,469

at the absolute highest that is so that

230
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
at the absolute highest that is so that
 

231
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,909
at the absolute highest that is so that
the light won't be able to reach the

232
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
the light won't be able to reach the
 

233
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,030
the light won't be able to reach the
spawning area above there

234
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
spawning area above there
 

235
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,350
spawning area above there
so blaze dealing with blazes much

236
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
so blaze dealing with blazes much
 

237
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,590
so blaze dealing with blazes much
like like creepers and skeletons and

238
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
like like creepers and skeletons and
 

239
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,550
like like creepers and skeletons and
and zombies i'm just going to extend

240
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
and zombies i'm just going to extend
 

241
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,270
and zombies i'm just going to extend
this tube

242
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
this tube
 

243
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,590
this tube
all the way down to that level

244
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600

 

245
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,110

and this will look pretty cool when it's

246
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
and this will look pretty cool when it's
 

247
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,029
and this will look pretty cool when it's
done too i think

248
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
done too i think
 

249
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,749
done too i think
the only difference really with them is

250
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
the only difference really with them is
 

251
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,070
the only difference really with them is
they

252
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
they
 

253
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,150
they
instead of falling they kind of float

254
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
instead of falling they kind of float
 

255
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,070
instead of falling they kind of float
down

256
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
down
 

257
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,350
down
so we don't have to worry about them

258
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
so we don't have to worry about them
 

259
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,270
so we don't have to worry about them
taking fall damage which is actually

260
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
taking fall damage which is actually
 

261
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,830
taking fall damage which is actually
nice

262
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
nice
 

263
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,950
nice
in this case um

264
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
in this case um
 

265
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,390
in this case um
they will fly around and target you

266
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
they will fly around and target you
 

267
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,710
they will fly around and target you
if if they see you but as long as

268
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
if if they see you but as long as
 

269
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,469
if if they see you but as long as
they're in their cage here that won't

270
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
they're in their cage here that won't
 

271
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,430
they're in their cage here that won't
ever happen so we don't have to worry

272
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
ever happen so we don't have to worry
 

273
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,270
ever happen so we don't have to worry
about that

274
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280

 

275
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,350

all right give me one moment to get this

276
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
all right give me one moment to get this
 

277
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,189
all right give me one moment to get this
lower

278
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199

 

279
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,749

yeah so the plan is uh to try make the

280
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
yeah so the plan is uh to try make the
 

281
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,230
yeah so the plan is uh to try make the
blaze fall down this tube

282
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
blaze fall down this tube
 

283
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,310
blaze fall down this tube
there'll be a lava stream at the bottom

284
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
there'll be a lava stream at the bottom
 

285
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,350
there'll be a lava stream at the bottom
that'll push them

286
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
that'll push them
 

287
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,830
that'll push them
towards the center from both of these so

288
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
towards the center from both of these so
 

289
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,670
towards the center from both of these so
they'll meet at the center

290
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
they'll meet at the center
 

291
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,510
they'll meet at the center
down below here and then we're gonna try

292
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
down below here and then we're gonna try
 

293
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,029
down below here and then we're gonna try
to make them go

294
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
to make them go
 

295
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,390
to make them go
probably that way a little bit and then

296
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
probably that way a little bit and then
 

297
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
probably that way a little bit and then
there'll be another tube that they swim

298
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
there'll be another tube that they swim
 

299
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,870
there'll be another tube that they swim
up and they land into a holding area so

300
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
up and they land into a holding area so
 

301
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,390
up and they land into a holding area so
they'll all be together in a holding

302
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
they'll all be together in a holding
 

303
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,430
they'll all be together in a holding
area

304
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
area
 

305
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,830
area
and then we'll have a crusher and all

306
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
and then we'll have a crusher and all
 

307
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,870
and then we'll have a crusher and all
that for them there

308
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
that for them there
 

309
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,430
that for them there
and it'll probably be a one by one

310
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
and it'll probably be a one by one
 

311
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
and it'll probably be a one by one
holding area instead of a two by two

312
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
holding area instead of a two by two
 

313
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,029
holding area instead of a two by two
like we have here so it's gonna be a lot

314
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
like we have here so it's gonna be a lot
 

315
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,950
like we have here so it's gonna be a lot
simpler

316
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
simpler
 

317
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,950
simpler
wires the wiring is going to be easier

318
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
wires the wiring is going to be easier
 

319
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,230
wires the wiring is going to be easier
and all that too

320
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240

 

321
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,430

okay yeah

322
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
okay yeah
 

323
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,870
okay yeah
it's been a while since we did anything

324
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
it's been a while since we did anything
 

325
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,350
it's been a while since we did anything
like this

326
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360

 

327
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,110

some mob tubing

328
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120

 

329
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,710

so this will be the ground

330
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
so this will be the ground
 

331
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,629
so this will be the ground
and this is just out of range so that

332
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
and this is just out of range so that
 

333
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,710
and this is just out of range so that
the lighting from the lava won't affect

334
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
the lighting from the lava won't affect
 

335
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,230
the lighting from the lava won't affect
the spawning at all

336
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
the spawning at all
 

337
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,749
the spawning at all
and um make that

338
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
and um make that
 

339
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,950
and um make that
go up here so the lava will go right

340
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
go up here so the lava will go right
 

341
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,110
go up here so the lava will go right
over here

342
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
over here
 

343
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,909
over here
and then i'll spread out we'll have

344
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
and then i'll spread out we'll have
 

345
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,589
and then i'll spread out we'll have
tubing here

346
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599

 

347
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,430

and in the nether lava can spread

348
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
and in the nether lava can spread
 

349
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,830
and in the nether lava can spread
farther so it's just like using water

350
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
farther so it's just like using water
 

351
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,589
farther so it's just like using water
pretty much

352
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
pretty much
 

353
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,830
pretty much
it doesn't burn the mobs another

354
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
it doesn't burn the mobs another
 

355
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,150
it doesn't burn the mobs another
difference is i don't think lava will

356
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
difference is i don't think lava will
 

357
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,670
difference is i don't think lava will
cause mobs to drown

358
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
cause mobs to drown
 

359
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,430
cause mobs to drown
in it which is kind of interesting

360
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
in it which is kind of interesting
 

361
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,270
in it which is kind of interesting
i think in the past it used to but not

362
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
i think in the past it used to but not
 

363
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,510
i think in the past it used to but not
anymore

364
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520

 

365
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,230

okay that'll do it let's check this out

366
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240

 

367
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,909

let me out of here okay

368
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919

 

369
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,790

all right that'll do it

370
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
all right that'll do it
 

371
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,790
all right that'll do it
so we'll probably build over top the

372
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
so we'll probably build over top the
 

373
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,550
so we'll probably build over top the
these tubes we might keep them

374
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
these tubes we might keep them
 

375
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,150
these tubes we might keep them
partially visible just for looks

376
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
partially visible just for looks
 

377
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,589
partially visible just for looks
it's kind of cool to have a flaming

378
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
it's kind of cool to have a flaming
 

379
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,430
it's kind of cool to have a flaming
stream for mobs

380
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
stream for mobs
 

381
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,110
stream for mobs
um we'll have to extend this so we can

382
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
um we'll have to extend this so we can
 

383
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,830
um we'll have to extend this so we can
do the stair and sign trick

384
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
do the stair and sign trick
 

385
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,830
do the stair and sign trick
which i don't think i no i don't have

386
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
which i don't think i no i don't have
 

387
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,510
which i don't think i no i don't have
any on me so i'll have to make some

388
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520

 

389
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,510

uh give me a moment start setting up the

390
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
uh give me a moment start setting up the
 

391
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,710
uh give me a moment start setting up the
other side here too

392
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
other side here too
 

393
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,710
other side here too
so we're gonna hook them together if we

394
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
so we're gonna hook them together if we
 

395
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,430
so we're gonna hook them together if we
can

396
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440

 

397
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,670

we'll see how it goes

398
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680

 

399
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,870

all right and let's put the lava down

400
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880

 

401
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,469

okay uh so i got the stairs in the sign

402
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
okay uh so i got the stairs in the sign
 

403
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,829
okay uh so i got the stairs in the sign
i'm going to

404
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839

 

405
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,230

drink one of these so we can safely work

406
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
drink one of these so we can safely work
 

407
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,470
drink one of these so we can safely work
around the lava

408
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
around the lava
 

409
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,190
around the lava
fire resistant potion we'll set up the

410
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
fire resistant potion we'll set up the
 

411
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,670
fire resistant potion we'll set up the
stair right here and so

412
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
stair right here and so
 

413
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,590
stair right here and so
the blades are the same size as us

414
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
the blades are the same size as us
 

415
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,110
the blades are the same size as us
basically so if we can't

416
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
basically so if we can't
 

417
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,870
basically so if we can't
go somewhere they can't go somewhere so

418
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
go somewhere they can't go somewhere so
 

419
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,790
go somewhere they can't go somewhere so
we need to get rid of this block

420
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
we need to get rid of this block
 

421
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,230
we need to get rid of this block
above to get up the stair and

422
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
above to get up the stair and
 

423
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,070
above to get up the stair and
we'll set up a sign over here

424
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080

 

425
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,430

and

426
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440

 

427
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,990

it's hard to see when you're on fire

428
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
it's hard to see when you're on fire
 

429
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,829
it's hard to see when you're on fire
go like that um

430
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
go like that um
 

431
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:34,829
go like that um
and then we'll do the same on this side

432
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

 

433
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,550

yay put that down

434
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560

 

435
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,550

i haven't actually like tested this

436
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
i haven't actually like tested this
 

437
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,790
i haven't actually like tested this
though guys so don't

438
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
though guys so don't
 

439
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,790
though guys so don't
don't take what i'm saying is fact just

440
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
don't take what i'm saying is fact just
 

441
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,389
don't take what i'm saying is fact just
yet because

442
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
yet because
 

443
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,870
yet because
we need to see if it actually works

444
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:51,880
we need to see if it actually works
 

445
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,430
we need to see if it actually works
[Music]

446
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
[Music]
 

447
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,430
[Music]
but i imagine it should work okay

448
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440

 

449
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,509

okay we'll set up another sign over here

450
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519

 

451
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,910

like that that'll hold the lava keep it

452
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
like that that'll hold the lava keep it
 

453
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,990
like that that'll hold the lava keep it
from flowing back down

454
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
from flowing back down
 

455
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,670
from flowing back down
and we'll have more glass here

456
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
and we'll have more glass here
 

457
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,550
and we'll have more glass here
and the lava will go right on top the

458
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
and the lava will go right on top the
 

459
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,110
and the lava will go right on top the
stair

460
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120

 

461
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,829

and we'll have another one on the other

462
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

463
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,230

side

464
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
side
 

465
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,030
side
and they will meet right here

466
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040

 

467
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,870

then we'll start going that way

468
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880

 

469
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,150

and make sure it's too high everywhere

470
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160

 

471
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,750

two blocks high so the blaze will fit

472
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
two blocks high so the blaze will fit
 

473
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,990
two blocks high so the blaze will fit
um

474
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000

 

475
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,550

should work

476
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560

 

477
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,990

good okay um

478
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
good okay um
 

479
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
good okay um
i'm gonna clear out some more ear area

480
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
i'm gonna clear out some more ear area
 

481
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,910
i'm gonna clear out some more ear area
here and i'll see you in a bit

482
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920

 

483
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,990

so obviously there's a big disadvantage

484
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
so obviously there's a big disadvantage
 

485
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,509
so obviously there's a big disadvantage
of doing it this way of

486
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
of doing it this way of
 

487
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,829
of doing it this way of
moving the blaze and connecting these

488
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
moving the blaze and connecting these
 

489
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,550
moving the blaze and connecting these
two together with the lava stream

490
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560

 

491
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,150

instead of them falling down and being

492
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
instead of them falling down and being
 

493
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,670
instead of them falling down and being
in the holding area already they're

494
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
in the holding area already they're
 

495
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,710
in the holding area already they're
going to have to

496
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
going to have to
 

497
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,190
going to have to
take a few seconds to travel down these

498
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
take a few seconds to travel down these
 

499
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,990
take a few seconds to travel down these
paths

500
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
paths
 

501
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,790
paths
oops which isn't a big deal but it is a

502
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
oops which isn't a big deal but it is a
 

503
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,750
oops which isn't a big deal but it is a
disadvantage

504
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
disadvantage
 

505
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,949
disadvantage
it's a little slower we are going to

506
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
it's a little slower we are going to
 

507
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,710
it's a little slower we are going to
set up a lava mob evader because i'm not

508
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
set up a lava mob evader because i'm not
 

509
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,389
set up a lava mob evader because i'm not
sure how the blades are going to react

510
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
sure how the blades are going to react
 

511
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,790
sure how the blades are going to react
to it i don't know

512
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
to it i don't know
 

513
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,230
to it i don't know
if it's going to i have a feeling it's

514
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
if it's going to i have a feeling it's
 

515
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,069
if it's going to i have a feeling it's
going to be different than the way water

516
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
going to be different than the way water
 

517
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,069
going to be different than the way water
works

518
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
works
 

519
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,790
works
i'm not sure so we'll we're just going

520
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
i'm not sure so we'll we're just going
 

521
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,310
i'm not sure so we'll we're just going
to set up a quick test here

522
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
to set up a quick test here
 

523
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,870
to set up a quick test here
we'll have um

524
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880

 

525
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,430

maybe we'll build this out another rack

526
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
maybe we'll build this out another rack
 

527
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,069
maybe we'll build this out another rack
we'll have a

528
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
we'll have a
 

529
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,310
we'll have a
tube here because this is only temporary

530
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
tube here because this is only temporary
 

531
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,069
tube here because this is only temporary
we'll have a tube here

532
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079

 

533
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,470

uh sign here to keep the lav in place

534
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
uh sign here to keep the lav in place
 

535
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,829
uh sign here to keep the lav in place
actually you know what we need to do we

536
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
actually you know what we need to do we
 

537
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,069
actually you know what we need to do we
need uh

538
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079

 

539
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,310

we need the lava like this and it'll

540
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
we need the lava like this and it'll
 

541
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,110
we need the lava like this and it'll
flow this

542
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
flow this
 

543
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,949
flow this
direction one block and that'll kind of

544
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
direction one block and that'll kind of
 

545
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,430
direction one block and that'll kind of
suck the blaze against this wall we're

546
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
suck the blaze against this wall we're
 

547
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,870
suck the blaze against this wall we're
making

548
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880

 

549
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,269

and let's see

550
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279

 

551
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:46,310

i think we need this to go up one

552
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320

 

553
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,750

something like that uh just on this

554
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
something like that uh just on this
 

555
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,350
something like that uh just on this
front we'll make glass and the rest will

556
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
front we'll make glass and the rest will
 

557
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,949
front we'll make glass and the rest will
do netherrack

558
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959

 

559
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,310

because i'm cheap so normally to make a

560
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
because i'm cheap so normally to make a
 

561
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,670
because i'm cheap so normally to make a
mob vader you would need

562
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
mob vader you would need
 

563
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,389
mob vader you would need
like a sign then a lava source block

564
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
like a sign then a lava source block
 

565
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,910
like a sign then a lava source block
then a sign that will have a source

566
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
then a sign that will have a source
 

567
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,389
then a sign that will have a source
block

568
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
block
 

569
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,190
block
all the way up i'm gonna see if it works

570
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
all the way up i'm gonna see if it works
 

571
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,069
all the way up i'm gonna see if it works
if you just have

572
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
if you just have
 

573
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,910
if you just have
lava at the top or if the downward

574
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
lava at the top or if the downward
 

575
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,550
lava at the top or if the downward
flow from the lab is gonna cause

576
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
flow from the lab is gonna cause
 

577
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,470
flow from the lab is gonna cause
problems

578
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480

 

579
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,470

so um i'll just put it there

580
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480

 

581
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,230

okay and we'll tap the top here

582
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
okay and we'll tap the top here
 

583
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,750
okay and we'll tap the top here
and i think we're ready to run our first

584
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
and i think we're ready to run our first
 

585
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,829
and i think we're ready to run our first
test

586
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
test
 

587
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,150
test
let's check this out um

588
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160

 

589
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,670

yep i think it's good let's do it

590
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680

 

591
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,629

awesome okay here we go first test we're

592
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
awesome okay here we go first test we're
 

593
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,629
awesome okay here we go first test we're
checking to make sure that they'll

594
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
checking to make sure that they'll
 

595
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,470
checking to make sure that they'll
actually go with the stream there and

596
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
actually go with the stream there and
 

597
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,150
actually go with the stream there and
also was we're checking to see if

598
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
also was we're checking to see if
 

599
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,910
also was we're checking to see if
they'll swim up that

600
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
they'll swim up that
 

601
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,310
they'll swim up that
or if they're just gonna sit the sit at

602
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
or if they're just gonna sit the sit at
 

603
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,670
or if they're just gonna sit the sit at
the bottom there

604
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
the bottom there
 

605
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,829
the bottom there
so we'll enable blaze spawning again

606
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
so we'll enable blaze spawning again
 

607
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,189
so we'll enable blaze spawning again
and then we'll head on down

608
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
and then we'll head on down
 

609
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,389
and then we'll head on down
and the quick way

610
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399

 

611
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,069

here they come so they should just start

612
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
here they come so they should just start
 

613
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,509
here they come so they should just start
falling down yep and what's he gonna do

614
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
falling down yep and what's he gonna do
 

615
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,350
falling down yep and what's he gonna do
oh

616
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360

 

617
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,829

he's ignoring lava that is not good

618
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

619
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,590

why is he not in it or is he just not

620
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
why is he not in it or is he just not
 

621
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,230
why is he not in it or is he just not
affected by it

622
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240

 

623
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:45,829

it looks like he's in it

624
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
it looks like he's in it
 

625
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,350
it looks like he's in it
um yeah i could have sworn these guys

626
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
um yeah i could have sworn these guys
 

627
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:02,710
um yeah i could have sworn these guys
got pushed by lava

628
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720

 

629
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,629

um

630
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639

 

631
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,110

oh okay i think they're

632
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120

 

633
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,550

they're hovering just a little bit too

634
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
they're hovering just a little bit too
 

635
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,030
they're hovering just a little bit too
high i think that's the problem

636
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040

 

637
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,269

it's hard to tell

638
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279

 

639
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,670

um let me place this down so i can get

640
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
um let me place this down so i can get
 

641
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,189
um let me place this down so i can get
better

642
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
better
 

643
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,350
better
view

644
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360

 

645
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,670

yeah there

646
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680

 

647
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,710

yeah that's what they're doing so i

648
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
yeah that's what they're doing so i
 

649
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,030
yeah that's what they're doing so i
might have to make this three high i'm

650
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
might have to make this three high i'm
 

651
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,430
might have to make this three high i'm
gonna

652
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
gonna
 

653
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,030
gonna
make that adjustment um

654
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
make that adjustment um
 

655
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,949
make that adjustment um
shut off blaze spawning and walk away so

656
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
shut off blaze spawning and walk away so
 

657
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,150
shut off blaze spawning and walk away so
it'll despawn

658
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
it'll despawn
 

659
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,230
it'll despawn
and then uh we'll be back

660
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240

 

661
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,509

okay so we're gonna make a few

662
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
okay so we're gonna make a few
 

663
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,670
okay so we're gonna make a few
adjustments here we got silk touch on

664
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
adjustments here we got silk touch on
 

665
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,949
adjustments here we got silk touch on
this pick

666
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
this pick
 

667
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,790
this pick
so we're not going to lose the glass

668
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
so we're not going to lose the glass
 

669
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,310
so we're not going to lose the glass
which is always nice

670
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320

 

671
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,389

uh we're going to lower this

672
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399

 

673
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,310

and then we're going to put pressure

674
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
and then we're going to put pressure
 

675
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,749
and then we're going to put pressure
plates down

676
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
plates down
 

677
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,870
plates down
and the lava will flow on top of these

678
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
and the lava will flow on top of these
 

679
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,629
and the lava will flow on top of these
i couldn't quite tell what was wrong

680
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
i couldn't quite tell what was wrong
 

681
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,269
i couldn't quite tell what was wrong
there either

682
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279

 

683
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,870

either the blades weren't actually

684
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
either the blades weren't actually
 

685
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,949
either the blades weren't actually
touching the rabbit or else it wasn't

686
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
touching the rabbit or else it wasn't
 

687
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,710
touching the rabbit or else it wasn't
affecting them i couldn't

688
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
affecting them i couldn't
 

689
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,110
affecting them i couldn't
tell and this will help us to figure

690
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
tell and this will help us to figure
 

691
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,030
tell and this will help us to figure
that out

692
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
that out
 

693
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,430
that out
i i hope it's that they just weren't

694
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
i i hope it's that they just weren't
 

695
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,069
i i hope it's that they just weren't
touching it

696
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
touching it
 

697
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,749
touching it
otherwise this whole

698
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
otherwise this whole
 

699
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,470
otherwise this whole
episode we won't get anything done

700
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480

 

701
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,949

so here's an example you can see blaze

702
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
so here's an example you can see blaze
 

703
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,310
so here's an example you can see blaze
not drowning in lava

704
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
not drowning in lava
 

705
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,430
not drowning in lava
and also it seems a

706
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
and also it seems a
 

707
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,470
and also it seems a
he might have swam up the downward lava

708
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
he might have swam up the downward lava
 

709
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,430
he might have swam up the downward lava
flow

710
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
flow
 

711
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,629
flow
maybe he could have flown i'm not sure

712
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
maybe he could have flown i'm not sure
 

713
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,949
maybe he could have flown i'm not sure
but they tend to do this you get stuck

714
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
but they tend to do this you get stuck
 

715
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,150
but they tend to do this you get stuck
at the top when you shut

716
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
at the top when you shut
 

717
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,269
at the top when you shut
when you shut it down and you can see

718
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
when you shut it down and you can see
 

719
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:03,990
when you shut it down and you can see
another mistake

720
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
another mistake
 

721
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,110
another mistake
i made with this i did not put the block

722
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
i made with this i did not put the block
 

723
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,110
i made with this i did not put the block
over top this spawner so

724
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120

 

725
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,590

uh blaze can sometimes spawn there and

726
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
uh blaze can sometimes spawn there and
 

727
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,789
uh blaze can sometimes spawn there and
then they get stuck

728
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
then they get stuck
 

729
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,990
then they get stuck
so i'll have to fix that sometime

730
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
so i'll have to fix that sometime
 

731
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,429
so i'll have to fix that sometime
but we're gonna turn this back on

732
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
but we're gonna turn this back on
 

733
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,909
but we're gonna turn this back on
we're off i should say it's opposite day

734
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919

 

735
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,590

and we will see what happens here

736
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
and we will see what happens here
 

737
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,990
and we will see what happens here
oh

738
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000

 

739
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,909

i hope come on

740
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919

 

741
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,390

so that they should fall into the lava

742
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
so that they should fall into the lava
 

743
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,590
so that they should fall into the lava
now i would imagine

744
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
now i would imagine
 

745
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,350
now i would imagine
he's still hovering on it

746
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360

 

747
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,789

almost looks like he's getting pushed

748
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
almost looks like he's getting pushed
 

749
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,470
almost looks like he's getting pushed
now though

750
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480

 

751
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,549

this guy will help us see for sure

752
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559

 

753
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,830

i don't know almost seems like it's not

754
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840

 

755
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,750

working

756
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760

 

757
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,590

yeah okay

758
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
yeah okay
 

759
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,830
yeah okay
so you can't push these guys with lava

760
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
so you can't push these guys with lava
 

761
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,350
so you can't push these guys with lava
streams

762
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
streams
 

763
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,390
streams
ah

764
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400

 

765
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,070

yeah better close that quickly

766
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080

 

767
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,950

i can't see the glass it's too confusing

768
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
i can't see the glass it's too confusing
 

769
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,830
i can't see the glass it's too confusing
okay i don't know what to do with this

770
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840

 

771
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,190

i better drink one of these

772
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200

 

773
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,590

okay i'll be back in a sec

774
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
okay i'll be back in a sec
 

775
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,830
okay i'll be back in a sec
okay haven't given up on this yet uh

776
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
okay haven't given up on this yet uh
 

777
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,630
okay haven't given up on this yet uh
we're just doing some more tests

778
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
we're just doing some more tests
 

779
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,750
we're just doing some more tests
i got uh

780
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760

 

781
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,669

i got a simple test set up here i want

782
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
i got a simple test set up here i want
 

783
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,950
i got a simple test set up here i want
to see if they can enter

784
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
to see if they can enter
 

785
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,110
to see if they can enter
a too high area and if they will jump

786
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
a too high area and if they will jump
 

787
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,190
a too high area and if they will jump
into this lava

788
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200

 

789
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,510

i almost think they're hovering prevents

790
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
i almost think they're hovering prevents
 

791
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,789
i almost think they're hovering prevents
them from getting into too high areas

792
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799

 

793
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,630

but maybe not

794
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640

 

795
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,190

oh he's going he's going so they can't

796
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
oh he's going he's going so they can't
 

797
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,710
oh he's going he's going so they can't
fit into high areas will you jump now

798
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
fit into high areas will you jump now
 

799
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,630
fit into high areas will you jump now
jump for us come on

800
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640

 

801
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,669

they're jumping why won't you jump

802
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679

 

803
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,270

no there we go

804
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
no there we go
 

805
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,390
no there we go
that works um because if they're

806
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
that works um because if they're
 

807
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,549
that works um because if they're
hovering in the lava we can

808
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
hovering in the lava we can
 

809
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,950
hovering in the lava we can
maybe push them with lava still if we

810
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
maybe push them with lava still if we
 

811
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,390
maybe push them with lava still if we
uh push them from their head

812
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400

 

813
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,710

oh what did i just do there okay i'll

814
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
oh what did i just do there okay i'll
 

815
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,909
oh what did i just do there okay i'll
set up another test

816
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919

 

817
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,310

okay so this one is set up much like the

818
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
okay so this one is set up much like the
 

819
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,350
okay so this one is set up much like the
last one

820
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
last one
 

821
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,270
last one
except i just added this little extra

822
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
except i just added this little extra
 

823
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,950
except i just added this little extra
piece here

824
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
piece here
 

825
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,350
piece here
we want them to go up and then to the

826
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
we want them to go up and then to the
 

827
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,350
we want them to go up and then to the
right

828
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
right
 

829
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,789
right
um so let's hop over here

830
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
um so let's hop over here
 

831
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,430
um so let's hop over here
finish bringing the lava this first lava

832
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
finish bringing the lava this first lava
 

833
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,669
finish bringing the lava this first lava
here will tell us if they can swim up a

834
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
here will tell us if they can swim up a
 

835
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,870
here will tell us if they can swim up a
downward

836
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
downward
 

837
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,070
downward
lava stream

838
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080

 

839
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,430

and right above us is glass so it's only

840
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
and right above us is glass so it's only
 

841
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,630
and right above us is glass so it's only
too high here

842
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
too high here
 

843
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,710
too high here
they'll swim up their head will hit the

844
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
they'll swim up their head will hit the
 

845
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,750
they'll swim up their head will hit the
glass here

846
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
glass here
 

847
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,990
glass here
and where their head is is where the lab

848
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
and where their head is is where the lab
 

849
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,110
and where their head is is where the lab
is going to be

850
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
is going to be
 

851
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,029
is going to be
so they won't be able to avoid it by

852
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
so they won't be able to avoid it by
 

853
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,750
so they won't be able to avoid it by
hovering or anything like that

854
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760

 

855
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,950

i hope we'll see what happens here

856
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
i hope we'll see what happens here
 

857
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,669
i hope we'll see what happens here
so something like that and we're just

858
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
so something like that and we're just
 

859
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,390
so something like that and we're just
seeing if

860
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
seeing if
 

861
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,029
seeing if
the lava stream actually pushes them

862
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
the lava stream actually pushes them
 

863
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,789
the lava stream actually pushes them
like if they're avoiding it or if it has

864
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
like if they're avoiding it or if it has
 

865
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,430
like if they're avoiding it or if it has
no effect

866
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440

 

867
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,110

all right here comes the first one he's

868
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
all right here comes the first one he's
 

869
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,310
all right here comes the first one he's
making up the downward lava stream

870
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320

 

871
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,149

and he is not getting pushed

872
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159

 

873
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,310

darn it so it doesn't actually push him

874
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320

 

875
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,750

ah that's disappointing

876
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
ah that's disappointing
 

877
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,310
ah that's disappointing
i wonder i wonder why they wouldn't make

878
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
i wonder i wonder why they wouldn't make
 

879
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,590
i wonder i wonder why they wouldn't make
them get pushed by lava

880
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600

 

881
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,630

that would have been a nice feature

882
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
that would have been a nice feature
 

883
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,630
that would have been a nice feature
so i guess the only real way to forcibly

884
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
so i guess the only real way to forcibly
 

885
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,470
so i guess the only real way to forcibly
move these guys

886
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
move these guys
 

887
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,390
move these guys
is with pistons or with mine carts

888
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
is with pistons or with mine carts
 

889
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,990
is with pistons or with mine carts
that's the only way i can think of

890
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
that's the only way i can think of
 

891
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,029
that's the only way i can think of
and neither of those is really

892
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
and neither of those is really
 

893
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,430
and neither of those is really
all that practical to use

894
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440

 

895
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,590

oh well i guess i'll have to clean this

896
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
oh well i guess i'll have to clean this
 

897
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,710
oh well i guess i'll have to clean this
up

898
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720

 

899
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,470

so i went ahead and ripped out all that

900
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
so i went ahead and ripped out all that
 

901
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,990
so i went ahead and ripped out all that
experimental magma

902
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
experimental magma
 

903
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,390
experimental magma
tubing we had here it's a shame that

904
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
tubing we had here it's a shame that
 

905
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,510
tubing we had here it's a shame that
didn't work that would have been really

906
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
didn't work that would have been really
 

907
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,710
didn't work that would have been really
nice

908
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
nice
 

909
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,950
nice
um we did learn a few things from it

910
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
um we did learn a few things from it
 

911
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,110
um we did learn a few things from it
though it wasn't a total waste of time

912
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
though it wasn't a total waste of time
 

913
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,830
though it wasn't a total waste of time
we know we can't move blaze with the lab

914
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
we know we can't move blaze with the lab
 

915
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,870
we know we can't move blaze with the lab
occurrence

916

occurrence
 

917
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,830
occurrence
that doesn't work now if we want we can

918
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
that doesn't work now if we want we can
 

919
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,990
that doesn't work now if we want we can
force them to swim up using lava but

920
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
force them to swim up using lava but
 

921
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,710
force them to swim up using lava but
that's about it

922
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
that's about it
 

923
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,590
that's about it
um instead what i'll probably end up

924
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
um instead what i'll probably end up
 

925
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,630
um instead what i'll probably end up
doing

926
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
doing
 

927
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,190
doing
possibly is like a conveyor belt system

928
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
possibly is like a conveyor belt system
 

929
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,549
possibly is like a conveyor belt system
i set up a little

930
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
i set up a little
 

931
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,830
i set up a little
prototype here how it would kind of work

932
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
prototype here how it would kind of work
 

933
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,630
prototype here how it would kind of work
we have

934
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
we have
 

935
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,870
we have
open fence gates with blocks in between

936
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
open fence gates with blocks in between
 

937
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,750
open fence gates with blocks in between
and we'll probably drop the blaze into

938
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
and we'll probably drop the blaze into
 

939
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,270
and we'll probably drop the blaze into
the holding areas

940
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
the holding areas
 

941
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,110
the holding areas
and then have a piston

942
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
and then have a piston
 

943
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,990
and then have a piston
thing that goes around on a clock let's

944
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
thing that goes around on a clock let's
 

945
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,510
thing that goes around on a clock let's
see i gotta hit this one next

946
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520

 

947
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,110

and that'll kind of push the blaze

948
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
and that'll kind of push the blaze
 

949
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,149
and that'll kind of push the blaze
around let's go around like this

950
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
around let's go around like this
 

951
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,470
around let's go around like this
this guy's trying to kill me still

952
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480

 

953
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,990

and then this one

954
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
and then this one
 

955
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,070
and then this one
and that way we'll be able to move the

956
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
and that way we'll be able to move the
 

957
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,149
and that way we'll be able to move the
blaze where we want

958
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
blaze where we want
 

959
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,669
blaze where we want
using relatively few pistons

960
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
using relatively few pistons
 

961
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,510
using relatively few pistons
i'm gonna make a few tweaks to these

962
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
i'm gonna make a few tweaks to these
 

963
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,029
i'm gonna make a few tweaks to these
blaze farms yet though

964
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039

 

965
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,870

all right so we're inside a blaze farm

966
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
all right so we're inside a blaze farm
 

967
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,430
all right so we're inside a blaze farm
right now i had an idea

968
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
right now i had an idea
 

969
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,230
right now i had an idea
on how we could really improve this and

970
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
on how we could really improve this and
 

971
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,350
on how we could really improve this and
simplify it

972
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
simplify it
 

973
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,029
simplify it
uh the whole point behind these

974
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
uh the whole point behind these
 

975
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,990
uh the whole point behind these
repeaters and pistons

976
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
repeaters and pistons
 

977
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,350
repeaters and pistons
that push well oh crap oh no

978
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
that push well oh crap oh no
 

979
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,909
that push well oh crap oh no
no no no no no

980
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
no no no no no
 

981
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,590
no no no no no
oh please don't kill me please don't

982
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
oh please don't kill me please don't
 

983
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,149
oh please don't kill me please don't
kill me

984
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159

 

985
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,590

oh so it's okay it's okay

986
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
oh so it's okay it's okay
 

987
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,510
oh so it's okay it's okay
i didn't lose my pick in any or anything

988
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
i didn't lose my pick in any or anything
 

989
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,630
i didn't lose my pick in any or anything
like that

990
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640

 

991
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,149

oh that sucked

992
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159

 

993
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,190

like i was saying the point

994
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
like i was saying the point
 

995
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,110
like i was saying the point
of these pistons is to push the blades

996
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
of these pistons is to push the blades
 

997
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,590
of these pistons is to push the blades
to the center so they fall down quicker

998
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
to the center so they fall down quicker
 

999
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,750
to the center so they fall down quicker
and get out of range of this spawner so

1000
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
and get out of range of this spawner so
 

1001
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,630
and get out of range of this spawner so
that more can spawn

1002
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
that more can spawn
 

1003
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,390
that more can spawn
uh but there's another way we could

1004
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
uh but there's another way we could
 

1005
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,549
uh but there's another way we could
probably do this that would be better

1006
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559

 

1007
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,510

instead of using oh see that was a good

1008
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
instead of using oh see that was a good
 

1009
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,149
instead of using oh see that was a good
thing i did that

1010
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159

 

1011
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,710

right uh let me get rid of these

1012
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
right uh let me get rid of these
 

1013
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,750
right uh let me get rid of these
and then we will do that

1014
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
and then we will do that
 

1015
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,149
and then we will do that
normally with this farm design the blaze

1016
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
normally with this farm design the blaze
 

1017
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,870
normally with this farm design the blaze
will

1018
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
will
 

1019
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,909
will
tend to walk around this top ring here

1020
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
tend to walk around this top ring here
 

1021
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,710
tend to walk around this top ring here
and occasionally they'll see that they

1022
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
and occasionally they'll see that they
 

1023
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,390
and occasionally they'll see that they
can go down below here

1024
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
can go down below here
 

1025
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,909
can go down below here
and then they'll walk off but generally

1026
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
and then they'll walk off but generally
 

1027
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,750
and then they'll walk off but generally
they just keep walking around this ring

1028
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
they just keep walking around this ring
 

1029
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,390
they just keep walking around this ring
for a while before that happens so a way

1030
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
for a while before that happens so a way
 

1031
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,350
for a while before that happens so a way
to speed that up

1032
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
to speed that up
 

1033
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,669
to speed that up
is to have fence gates

1034
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679

 

1035
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,950

like so and it creates a fake floor

1036
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
like so and it creates a fake floor
 

1037
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,669
like so and it creates a fake floor
for their pathfinding to see and then

1038
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
for their pathfinding to see and then
 

1039
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,669
for their pathfinding to see and then
they're more likely to walk

1040
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
they're more likely to walk
 

1041
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,909
they're more likely to walk
towards the center here and fall down

1042
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
towards the center here and fall down
 

1043
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,190
towards the center here and fall down
because these will be open

1044
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
because these will be open
 

1045
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,830
because these will be open
and they'll just fall right through them

1046
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840

 

1047
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,789

and

1048
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
and
 

1049
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,269
and
and that's all there is to it so at each

1050
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
and that's all there is to it so at each
 

1051
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,830
and that's all there is to it so at each
layer i'm going to do this

1052
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
layer i'm going to do this
 

1053
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,870
layer i'm going to do this
and it'll it'll just increase or

1054
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
and it'll it'll just increase or
 

1055
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,549
and it'll it'll just increase or
decrease the time it takes them to find

1056
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
decrease the time it takes them to find
 

1057
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,710
decrease the time it takes them to find
the center

1058
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
the center
 

1059
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,350
the center
so it's really simple actually

1060
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360

 

1061
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,269

okay it's done let's try it out and see

1062
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
okay it's done let's try it out and see
 

1063
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,630
okay it's done let's try it out and see
how it compares

1064
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
how it compares
 

1065
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,870
how it compares
uh there might be a little issue here

1066
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
uh there might be a little issue here
 

1067
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,590
uh there might be a little issue here
because i have

1068
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600

 

1069
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,830

on the second layer there i think the

1070
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
on the second layer there i think the
 

1071
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,750
on the second layer there i think the
blaze heads are going to be inside the

1072
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
blaze heads are going to be inside the
 

1073
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,710
blaze heads are going to be inside the
fence gates

1074
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
fence gates
 

1075
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,430
fence gates
so that might make them get stuck there

1076
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
so that might make them get stuck there
 

1077
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,990
so that might make them get stuck there
we'll see what happens

1078
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
we'll see what happens
 

1079
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,310
we'll see what happens
i'll have to probably adjust the shape

1080
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
i'll have to probably adjust the shape
 

1081
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,350
i'll have to probably adjust the shape
of this thing

1082
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
of this thing
 

1083
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,110
of this thing
if i stick to this idea

1084
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120

 

1085
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,590

but i just want to see what happens

1086
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600

 

1087
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,750

okay let's go down i did close it right

1088
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
okay let's go down i did close it right
 

1089
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,990
okay let's go down i did close it right
yeah it's closed

1090
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000

 

1091
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,990

let's see what are they doing

1092
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000

 

1093
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,430

yeah i see he's stuck on the second

1094
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
yeah i see he's stuck on the second
 

1095
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,510
yeah i see he's stuck on the second
layer now because his head's inside a

1096
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
layer now because his head's inside a
 

1097
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,310
layer now because his head's inside a
fence gate

1098
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
fence gate
 

1099
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,070
fence gate
an open fence gate and he can't see

1100
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
an open fence gate and he can't see
 

1101
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,549
an open fence gate and he can't see
through that

1102
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559

 

1103
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,390

but as soon as this guy starts moving

1104
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
but as soon as this guy starts moving
 

1105
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,710
but as soon as this guy starts moving
he'll probably walk off

1106
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
he'll probably walk off
 

1107
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,470
he'll probably walk off
yeah so it's definitely helping

1108
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
yeah so it's definitely helping
 

1109
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,549
yeah so it's definitely helping
but i'll need like a three block drop so

1110
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
but i'll need like a three block drop so
 

1111
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,990
but i'll need like a three block drop so
that their head

1112
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
that their head
 

1113
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,549
that their head
isn't in the fence gates

1114
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559

 

1115
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,830

because they can't see anything right

1116
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
because they can't see anything right
 

1117
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,510
because they can't see anything right
now

1118
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520

 

1119
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,950

yeah cool all right

1120
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
yeah cool all right
 

1121
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,310
yeah cool all right
um i'll think about this stuff some more

1122
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
um i'll think about this stuff some more
 

1123
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,070
um i'll think about this stuff some more
if you guys have ideas let me know in

1124
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
if you guys have ideas let me know in
