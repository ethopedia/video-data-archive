got lots done with these things now I
 

29
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,229
got lots done with these things now I
did the wiring only one that's not done

30
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
did the wiring only one that's not done

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,260
to interfere with each other just good
if you don't do the wiring right like

46
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,270
if you don't do the wiring right like
 

47
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,390

sometimes when you put the crusher out

48
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,400
sometimes when you put the crusher out
 

49
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,550

Pistons don't go back if the barrier is
 

53
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,460
Pistons don't go back if the barrier is
down so took a little bit of messing

54
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,470
down so took a little bit of messing
 

55
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,679
down so took a little bit of messing
around with the wiring but the big thing

56
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:48,689
around with the wiring but the big thing
 

57
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,429
around with the wiring but the big thing
I also got the master switches DUP which

58
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:52,439
I also got the master switches DUP which
 

59
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,679
I also got the master switches DUP which
is pretty cool let's see barriers I love

60
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:00,689
is pretty cool let's see barriers I love
 

61
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,430
is pretty cool let's see barriers I love
how that looks

62
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:04,440

 

63
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,830

I can just hit this all day open closed

64
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
I can just hit this all day open closed
 

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:21,250
I can just hit this all day open closed
open closed and we have the Crushers and

66
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,260
open closed and we have the Crushers and
 

67
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:34,130
open closed and we have the Crushers and
we have the water very cool Oh guess

68
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,140
we have the water very cool Oh guess
 

69
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,560
we have the water very cool Oh guess
that one's spilling over that's not good

70
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:41,570

 

71
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,120

that should fix it except we lost the

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130
that should fix it except we lost the
 

73
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:51,010
that should fix it except we lost the
lever from that lots of work into this

74
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,020
lever from that lots of work into this
 

75
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,720
lever from that lots of work into this
can hardly wait till I get my spawning

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,730
can hardly wait till I get my spawning
 

77
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,600
can hardly wait till I get my spawning
pads done and then I'll actually be able

78
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,610
pads done and then I'll actually be able
 

79
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,630
pads done and then I'll actually be able
to see it working this is going to look

80
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
to see it working this is going to look
 

81
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,370
to see it working this is going to look
really cool when it's done - I think I'm

82
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:01,380
really cool when it's done - I think I'm
 

83
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,450
really cool when it's done - I think I'm
it because there's going to be like

84
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:02,460
it because there's going to be like
 

85
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,690
it because there's going to be like
glass tubes above each of these things

86
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:05,700
glass tubes above each of these things
 

87
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,130
glass tubes above each of these things
going up to the ceiling I think it's

88
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,140
going up to the ceiling I think it's
 

89
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,229
going up to the ceiling I think it's
gonna have a pretty cool looking effect

90
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239
gonna have a pretty cool looking effect
 

91
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,900
gonna have a pretty cool looking effect
and I plan on replacing these sandstone

92
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:14,910
and I plan on replacing these sandstone
 

93
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,410
and I plan on replacing these sandstone
blocks with glowstone so it'll be like a

94
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
blocks with glowstone so it'll be like a
 

95
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,000
blocks with glowstone so it'll be like a
plus sign out of glowstone probably and

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,010
plus sign out of glowstone probably and
 

97
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,820
plus sign out of glowstone probably and
less closed on melts ice I'm not sure

98
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:25,830
less closed on melts ice I'm not sure
 

99
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,210
less closed on melts ice I'm not sure
about that yet I'm sure one of you guys

100
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,220
about that yet I'm sure one of you guys
 

101
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:38,720
about that yet I'm sure one of you guys
will tell me in this video yeah that's

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:38,730
will tell me in this video yeah that's
 

103
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,199
will tell me in this video yeah that's
better now

104
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,209

 

105
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:55,190

let's see items moving there's items

106
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
let's see items moving there's items
 

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,099
let's see items moving there's items
water comes pushes in the long they

108
00:03:59,099 --> 00:03:59,109
water comes pushes in the long they
 

109
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,339
water comes pushes in the long they
quickly fall down to the collection area

110
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:04,349

 

111
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,849

pretty cool

112
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:05,859
pretty cool
 

113
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,309
pretty cool
so you can manually set each of these

114
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:11,319
so you can manually set each of these
 

115
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:18,810
so you can manually set each of these
things too so for example I could have

116
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:18,820
things too so for example I could have
 

117
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,580
things too so for example I could have
the barrier down and then it overrides

118
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:23,590
the barrier down and then it overrides
 

119
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,960
the barrier down and then it overrides
the master switch that setting although

120
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:27,970
the master switch that setting although
 

121
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,839
the master switch that setting although
the bottom piston moves for a second

122
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:30,849
the bottom piston moves for a second
 

123
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,980
the bottom piston moves for a second
that might be a problem later I just

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:34,990
that might be a problem later I just
 

125
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,820
that might be a problem later I just
it's only when it's going down I'll have

126
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:38,830
it's only when it's going down I'll have
 

127
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,969
it's only when it's going down I'll have
to look into that later

128
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:40,979
to look into that later
 

129
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,439
to look into that later
so you can override the master switches

130
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,449
so you can override the master switches
 

131
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,770
so you can override the master switches
these are just here temporarily I plan I

132
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:48,780
these are just here temporarily I plan I
 

133
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,060
these are just here temporarily I plan I
will be able to control them

134
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,070
will be able to control them
 

135
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,219
will be able to control them
the master switches using levers but

136
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:53,229
the master switches using levers but
 

137
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,110
the master switches using levers but
they will also be done automatically and

138
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
they will also be done automatically and
 

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
they will also be done automatically and
then I'll have my manual settings too

140
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,330
then I'll have my manual settings too
 

141
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,270
then I'll have my manual settings too
which is good let's go check out the

142
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
which is good let's go check out the
 

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,649
which is good let's go check out the
wiring I guess I'm out of redstone

144
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:07,659
wiring I guess I'm out of redstone
 

145
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:16,110
wiring I guess I'm out of redstone
wiring again this was a big redstone

146
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,120
wiring again this was a big redstone
 

147
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,210
wiring again this was a big redstone
requirement to make this goes all the

148
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,220
requirement to make this goes all the
 

149
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,300
requirement to make this goes all the
way around

150
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,310

 

151
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,110

these are the three master lines maybe

152
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,120
these are the three master lines maybe
 

153
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,570
these are the three master lines maybe
I'll skip to today so we can see better

154
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,580

 

155
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,390

ah that's better okay so those bottom

156
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
ah that's better okay so those bottom
 

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,790
ah that's better okay so those bottom
ones some fresher

158
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:39,800

 

159
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,930

so that wire goes around goes to the

160
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940
so that wire goes around goes to the
 

161
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,460
so that wire goes around goes to the
left here the lever for the crusher is

162
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,470
left here the lever for the crusher is
 

163
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,880
left here the lever for the crusher is
behind this sandstone block here and it

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:52,890
behind this sandstone block here and it
 

165
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,920
behind this sandstone block here and it
lights up this wire it goes here around

166
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:56,930
lights up this wire it goes here around
 

167
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,680
lights up this wire it goes here around
this piston and the one below it and

168
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,690
this piston and the one below it and
 

169
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,130
this piston and the one below it and
that moves it the crusher having this

170
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,140
that moves it the crusher having this
 

171
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,580
that moves it the crusher having this
repeater here prevents any current from

172
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:07,590
repeater here prevents any current from
 

173
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,370
repeater here prevents any current from
back flowing otherwise it would when you

174
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,380
back flowing otherwise it would when you
 

175
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,370
back flowing otherwise it would when you
activate the lever manually if this

176
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,380
activate the lever manually if this
 

177
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,230
activate the lever manually if this
repeater wasn't here this power would be

178
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
repeater wasn't here this power would be
 

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,930
repeater wasn't here this power would be
able to go to the master wire and it

180
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:20,940
able to go to the master wire and it
 

181
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,780
able to go to the master wire and it
would activate all the pressures down

182
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:23,790
would activate all the pressures down
 

183
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,380
would activate all the pressures down
the line so it's very important I put

184
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,390
the line so it's very important I put
 

185
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:33,440
the line so it's very important I put
this here which I found out later and

186
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,450
this here which I found out later and
 

187
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:42,230
this here which I found out later and
the second one is the barriers and like

188
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
the second one is the barriers and like
 

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,210
the second one is the barriers and like
like this repeater here I use the

190
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,220
like this repeater here I use the
 

191
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,370
like this repeater here I use the
redstone torch so that power can't

192
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
redstone torch so that power can't
 

193
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,170
redstone torch so that power can't
backflow to the master line it lights up

194
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,180
backflow to the master line it lights up
 

195
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:01,720
backflow to the master line it lights up
this wire here which goes above to

196
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:01,730

 

197
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,930

all right

198
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:07,940

 

199
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:14,900

yeah I don't know how this works all

200
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:14,910
yeah I don't know how this works all
 

201
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,730
yeah I don't know how this works all
right there's a piston there so lever

202
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:18,740
right there's a piston there so lever
 

203
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,550
right there's a piston there so lever
manually activates this wire here power

204
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
manually activates this wire here power
 

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,220
manually activates this wire here power
goes to the sandstone block and flows to

206
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,230
goes to the sandstone block and flows to
 

207
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,820
goes to the sandstone block and flows to
the top barrier piston right there and

208
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:30,830
the top barrier piston right there and
 

209
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,150
the top barrier piston right there and
it also goes down here to the bottom one

210
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,160
it also goes down here to the bottom one
 

211
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,730
it also goes down here to the bottom one
and then the water one goes at the top

212
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
and then the water one goes at the top
 

213
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:51,200
and then the water one goes at the top
here and it's right over here the water

214
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,210
here and it's right over here the water
 

215
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,000
here and it's right over here the water
ones not controlled manually so I don't

216
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,010
ones not controlled manually so I don't
 

217
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,280
ones not controlled manually so I don't
have to worry too much about that one

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,290
have to worry too much about that one
 

219
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:04,850
have to worry too much about that one
I'll power back flowing or anything and

220
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll power back flowing or anything and
 

221
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,070
I'll power back flowing or anything and
maybe we'll walk around the wire here to

222
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
maybe we'll walk around the wire here to
 

223
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,260
maybe we'll walk around the wire here to
sleek and get idea how it all looks i

224
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,270
sleek and get idea how it all looks i
 

225
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,790
sleek and get idea how it all looks i
stacked the master wires vertically just

226
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:13,800
stacked the master wires vertically just
 

227
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,110
stacked the master wires vertically just
because I would use less space that way

228
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
because I would use less space that way
 

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,080
because I would use less space that way
add turns out I actually have plenty of

230
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,090
add turns out I actually have plenty of
 

231
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,020
add turns out I actually have plenty of
space here like look at these corners

232
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,030
space here like look at these corners
 

233
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,330
space here like look at these corners
it's all empty so if I need to adjust

234
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,340
it's all empty so if I need to adjust
 

235
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,460
it's all empty so if I need to adjust
these things I probably will be able to

236
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,470
these things I probably will be able to
 

237
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,910
these things I probably will be able to
because there's quite a bit of space

238
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:34,920
because there's quite a bit of space
 

239
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:45,020
because there's quite a bit of space
between each one yet which is fine yeah

240
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,030
between each one yet which is fine yeah
 

241
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,120
between each one yet which is fine yeah
so it just goes all the way around and

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,130
so it just goes all the way around and
 

243
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,230
so it just goes all the way around and
these like these things can be

244
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
these like these things can be
 

245
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,800
these like these things can be
customized to like for example say the

246
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:54,810
customized to like for example say the
 

247
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,570
customized to like for example say the
one for Wolves some people were

248
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:56,580
one for Wolves some people were
 

249
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,010
one for Wolves some people were
wondering about this how it's going to

250
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,020
wondering about this how it's going to
 

251
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,620
wondering about this how it's going to
do it I could for example get rid of

252
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:00,630
do it I could for example get rid of
 

253
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,660
do it I could for example get rid of
this glass block and use a half slab

254
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:02,670
this glass block and use a half slab
 

255
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,290
this glass block and use a half slab
instead so that when the barrier is down

256
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:05,300
instead so that when the barrier is down
 

257
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,710
instead so that when the barrier is down
it'll be glass block and a half block so

258
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,720
it'll be glass block and a half block so
 

259
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,130
it'll be glass block and a half block so
I can still interact with the Wolves

260
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,140
I can still interact with the Wolves
 

261
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,460
I can still interact with the Wolves
without the mix escaping so you know

262
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,470
without the mix escaping so you know
 

263
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,620
without the mix escaping so you know
simple things like that can be done to

264
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:18,630
simple things like that can be done to
 

265
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,260
simple things like that can be done to
each one

266
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,270

 

267
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,060

this first one here has a fifth lever

268
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,070
this first one here has a fifth lever
 

269
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,880
this first one here has a fifth lever
just because I had another idea I might

270
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:28,890
just because I had another idea I might
 

271
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,270
just because I had another idea I might
end up doing to all them but I'm going

272
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,280
end up doing to all them but I'm going
 

273
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,020
end up doing to all them but I'm going
to experiment with it first I kind of

274
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,030
to experiment with it first I kind of
 

275
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,210
to experiment with it first I kind of
wanted a way to get mobs into mine carts

276
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
wanted a way to get mobs into mine carts
 

277
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,150
wanted a way to get mobs into mine carts
as well sure to have that option at

278
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
as well sure to have that option at
 

279
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
as well sure to have that option at
least so that's what this fifth levers

280
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,290
least so that's what this fifth levers
 

281
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,450
least so that's what this fifth levers
for so I have the lab a very far down

282
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,460
for so I have the lab a very far down
 

283
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,980
for so I have the lab a very far down
now man there's a glass block above it

284
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:50,990
now man there's a glass block above it
 

285
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,110
now man there's a glass block above it
this lever removes the last block so

286
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,120
this lever removes the last block so
 

287
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,430
this lever removes the last block so
that's stuffed and fall in the lava so

288
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,440
that's stuffed and fall in the lava so
 

289
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,630
that's stuffed and fall in the lava so
if the glass blocks like that it creates

290
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
if the glass blocks like that it creates
 

291
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,370
if the glass blocks like that it creates
kind of like a second holding area and I

292
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,380
kind of like a second holding area and I
 

293
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,520
kind of like a second holding area and I
can run my carts to the corner and pick

294
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,530
can run my carts to the corner and pick
 

295
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,140
can run my carts to the corner and pick
up mobs through the glass if you watch

296
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,150
up mobs through the glass if you watch
 

297
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,000
up mobs through the glass if you watch
my older episodes around

298
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,010
my older episodes around
 

299
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,160
my older episodes around
I believe the 20s or so I did that

300
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,170
I believe the 20s or so I did that
 

301
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,500
I believe the 20s or so I did that
before I'm hoping that trick still works

302
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,510
before I'm hoping that trick still works
 

303
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:28,730
before I'm hoping that trick still works
so that's kind of one one other thing I

304
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:28,740
so that's kind of one one other thing I
 

305
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,070
so that's kind of one one other thing I
might end up doing so I would just have

306
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,080
might end up doing so I would just have
 

307
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,630
might end up doing so I would just have
glass blocks over there so I would have

308
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:35,640
glass blocks over there so I would have
 

309
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,180
glass blocks over there so I would have
to run like a minecart track to the

310
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,190
to run like a minecart track to the
 

311
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,910
to run like a minecart track to the
corner here and hopefully they'll get

312
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
corner here and hopefully they'll get
 

313
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,610
corner here and hopefully they'll get
picked up but just an experimental idea

314
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:48,620

 

315
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,590

the one point seven point three patch

316
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
the one point seven point three patch
 

317
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,210
the one point seven point three patch
fix the moving ice blocks with pistons

318
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,220
fix the moving ice blocks with pistons
 

319
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,660
fix the moving ice blocks with pistons
which I'm really happy about

320
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:58,670
which I'm really happy about
 

321
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,830
which I'm really happy about
now the Pistons don't glitch out and the

322
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:02,840
now the Pistons don't glitch out and the
 

323
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,200
now the Pistons don't glitch out and the
ice box don't create water streams so

324
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,210
ice box don't create water streams so
 

325
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,970
ice box don't create water streams so
that's great one thing I really like

326
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:12,980
that's great one thing I really like
 

327
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,220
that's great one thing I really like
about being in a snowy biome is I can

328
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,230
about being in a snowy biome is I can
 

329
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,820
about being in a snowy biome is I can
use ice which allows you to do several

330
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:18,830
use ice which allows you to do several
 

331
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,660
use ice which allows you to do several
tricks like for example moving items and

332
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:22,670
tricks like for example moving items and
 

333
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,390
tricks like for example moving items and
water streams is a really easy really

334
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:25,400
water streams is a really easy really
 

335
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,030
water streams is a really easy really
really easy because you can move it

336
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,040
really easy because you can move it
 

337
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,750
really easy because you can move it
basically an infinite distance without

338
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:34,760
basically an infinite distance without
 

339
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,310
basically an infinite distance without
having to go down levels like you

340
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
having to go down levels like you
 

341
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,190
having to go down levels like you
normally do because the items have

342
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
normally do because the items have
 

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,000
normally do because the items have
enough momentum to go from one stream to

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,010
enough momentum to go from one stream to
 

345
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,270
enough momentum to go from one stream to
another and step by I think up the six

346
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:46,280
another and step by I think up the six
 

347
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,450
another and step by I think up the six
blocks of ice so these will just keep

348
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:52,460
blocks of ice so these will just keep
 

349
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,390
blocks of ice so these will just keep
going around and around until they

350
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,400
going around and around until they
 

351
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
going around and around until they
disappear or the water freezes

352
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,410

 

353
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,650

some people are wondering about that in

354
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:04,660
some people are wondering about that in
 

355
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,940
some people are wondering about that in
snowy biomes water only freezes if it's

356
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:09,950
snowy biomes water only freezes if it's
 

357
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,150
snowy biomes water only freezes if it's
exposed if there's nothing above it

358
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
exposed if there's nothing above it
 

359
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,100
exposed if there's nothing above it
there's no blocks above it it took

360
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,110
there's no blocks above it it took
 

361
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,550
there's no blocks above it it took
freeze and it can freeze even if it's

362
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
freeze and it can freeze even if it's
 

363
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,920
freeze and it can freeze even if it's
moving water like this the source block

364
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:20,930
moving water like this the source block
 

365
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:33,860
moving water like this the source block
wheel that looks pretty cool

366
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:33,870

 

367
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,450

cool one thing I'm disappointed about

368
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:36,460
cool one thing I'm disappointed about
 

369
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,610
cool one thing I'm disappointed about
those it seemed like boats and stuff

370
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:38,620
those it seemed like boats and stuff
 

371
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,820
those it seemed like boats and stuff
don't move friction like they still have

372
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:41,830
don't move friction like they still have
 

373
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,320
don't move friction like they still have
the normal friction on ice Hey look who

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,330
the normal friction on ice Hey look who
 

375
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,340
the normal friction on ice Hey look who
it is another is I pick this location is

376
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,350
it is another is I pick this location is
 

377
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,290
it is another is I pick this location is
it's ponds lots of wolves which is cool

378
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,300

 

379
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,610

so this is going to look a lot different

380
00:12:59,610 --> 00:12:59,620
so this is going to look a lot different
 

381
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,120
so this is going to look a lot different
when it's all done there's going to be

382
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,130
when it's all done there's going to be
 

383
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,269
when it's all done there's going to be
like a skirting around this bottom all

384
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
like a skirting around this bottom all
 

385
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,010
like a skirting around this bottom all
around it you won't be able to see

386
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,020
around it you won't be able to see
 

387
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,630
around it you won't be able to see
underneath here also all this wiring on

388
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:12,640
underneath here also all this wiring on
 

389
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
underneath here also all this wiring on
the outside you won't be will see it

390
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:14,650
the outside you won't be will see it
 

391
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,130
the outside you won't be will see it
it'll be covered and I'm going to be

392
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,140
it'll be covered and I'm going to be
 

393
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,450
it'll be covered and I'm going to be
building my base around around the

394
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,460
building my base around around the
 

395
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,890
building my base around around the
center contraption here they'll probably

396
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:25,900
center contraption here they'll probably
 

397
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,320
center contraption here they'll probably
be a staircase on the right here and one

398
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,330
be a staircase on the right here and one
 

399
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,940
be a staircase on the right here and one
on the left there won't be one in the

400
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:29,950
on the left there won't be one in the
 

401
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,360
on the left there won't be one in the
middle like I have here it will

402
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,370
middle like I have here it will
 

403
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,450
middle like I have here it will
gradually go up the stairs probably will

404
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:36,460
gradually go up the stairs probably will
 

405
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,770
gradually go up the stairs probably will
come up probably somewhere over here and

406
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:39,780
come up probably somewhere over here and
 

407
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,970
come up probably somewhere over here and
same for the other side and there's

408
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:44,980
same for the other side and there's
 

409
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,650
same for the other side and there's
going to be water channels we might

410
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:46,660
going to be water channels we might
 

411
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,880
going to be water channels we might
actually start building those this

412
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:47,890
actually start building those this
 

413
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:55,410
actually start building those this
episode there's going to be so you'll go

414
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:55,420
episode there's going to be so you'll go
 

415
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,050
episode there's going to be so you'll go
you'll gradually go up a little bit get

416
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,060
you'll gradually go up a little bit get
 

417
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,840
you'll gradually go up a little bit get
to this part here excuse me ah it'll be

418
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:03,850
to this part here excuse me ah it'll be
 

419
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,270
to this part here excuse me ah it'll be
one collection thing on this right side

420
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,280
one collection thing on this right side
 

421
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,750
one collection thing on this right side
there'll be one on the left side and

422
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:08,760
there'll be one on the left side and
 

423
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,750
there'll be one on the left side and
there'll be one in the middle is the

424
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:12,760
there'll be one in the middle is the
 

425
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,840
there'll be one in the middle is the
plan one on the right side will have

426
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:15,850
plan one on the right side will have
 

427
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,610
plan one on the right side will have
your passive mobs drops so since this is

428
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:20,620
your passive mobs drops so since this is
 

429
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,800
your passive mobs drops so since this is
cows sheep pigs chickens all those will

430
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:25,810
cows sheep pigs chickens all those will
 

431
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,570
cows sheep pigs chickens all those will
merge together in one water stream and

432
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:27,580
merge together in one water stream and
 

433
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,880
merge together in one water stream and
come out on the right side here and then

434
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:32,890
come out on the right side here and then
 

435
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,130
come out on the right side here and then
your slimes creepers skeletons zombies

436
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,140
your slimes creepers skeletons zombies
 

437
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,130
your slimes creepers skeletons zombies
will come out on and spiders will come

438
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,140
will come out on and spiders will come
 

439
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,570
will come out on and spiders will come
out on this

440
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:44,580

 

441
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,050

collection area here and then they'll

442
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,060
collection area here and then they'll
 

443
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,660
collection area here and then they'll
also be a switch which will allow you to

444
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:53,670
also be a switch which will allow you to
 

445
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,130
also be a switch which will allow you to
either have them separate like that or

446
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,140
either have them separate like that or
 

447
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,650
either have them separate like that or
merge them together in one main

448
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:58,660
merge them together in one main
 

449
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,280
merge them together in one main
collection area in the center and that

450
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,290
collection area in the center and that
 

451
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,110
collection area in the center and that
will be similar to what I have in my

452
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,120
will be similar to what I have in my
 

453
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,890
will be similar to what I have in my
storage room so again the idea is to

454
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:10,900
storage room so again the idea is to
 

455
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,020
storage room so again the idea is to
have the option to do whatever you want

456
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,030
have the option to do whatever you want
 

457
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:22,110
have the option to do whatever you want
and not limit yourself the animals are

458
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,120
and not limit yourself the animals are
 

459
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,620
and not limit yourself the animals are
freaking out what you do with our home

460
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:24,630
freaking out what you do with our home
 

461
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:34,290
freaking out what you do with our home
where's all the grass where are all the

462
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:34,300
where's all the grass where are all the
 

463
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:42,120
where's all the grass where are all the
polar bears cow feces a polar bear she

464
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,130
polar bears cow feces a polar bear she
 

465
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,300
polar bears cow feces a polar bear she
thinks she's a polar bear so it doesn't

466
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,310
thinks she's a polar bear so it doesn't
 

467
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,490
thinks she's a polar bear so it doesn't
need to be snowing for the water to

468
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:50,500
need to be snowing for the water to
 

469
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,650
need to be snowing for the water to
freeze into ice either as you can see

470
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:57,660

 

471
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,770

that was a big island this is the other

472
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:04,780
that was a big island this is the other
 

473
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,160
that was a big island this is the other
island I've been working on it's also

474
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,170
island I've been working on it's also
 

475
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,700
island I've been working on it's also
right next to the base it's a little bit

476
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:11,710
right next to the base it's a little bit
 

477
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,070
right next to the base it's a little bit
bigger but I'm actually dealing with it

478
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,080
bigger but I'm actually dealing with it
 

479
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,420
bigger but I'm actually dealing with it
pretty quickly I'm getting really good

480
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:18,430
pretty quickly I'm getting really good
 

481
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,890
pretty quickly I'm getting really good
at control explosions with TNT so

482
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:24,900
at control explosions with TNT so
 

483
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,660
at control explosions with TNT so
doesn't take nearly as long to clean out

484
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:27,670
doesn't take nearly as long to clean out
 

485
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:35,250
doesn't take nearly as long to clean out
the area and I just have to go up to

486
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,260
the area and I just have to go up to
 

487
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,650
the area and I just have to go up to
about just like a line over here and

488
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660
about just like a line over here and
 

489
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,070
about just like a line over here and
that's the only real island left once I

490
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,080
that's the only real island left once I
 

491
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,730
that's the only real island left once I
finish this one off it's not really an

492
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:47,740
finish this one off it's not really an
 

493
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,060
finish this one off it's not really an
island it's a giant landmass

494
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,070
island it's a giant landmass
 

495
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,249
island it's a giant landmass
so I'm guessing I will just clear the

496
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:53,259
so I'm guessing I will just clear the
 

497
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,360
so I'm guessing I will just clear the
grass off of it

498
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,370
grass off of it
 

499
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,810
grass off of it
and place torches to keep the mobs from

500
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:57,820
and place torches to keep the mobs from
 

501
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,400
and place torches to keep the mobs from
spawning otherwise I need to clear the

502
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,410
spawning otherwise I need to clear the
 

503
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,510
spawning otherwise I need to clear the
island pretty much where that gravel

504
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
island pretty much where that gravel
 

505
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,309
island pretty much where that gravel
column is everything left of it from the

506
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:11,319
column is everything left of it from the
 

507
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,860
column is everything left of it from the
way I'm facing right now so I'd have to

508
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:16,870
way I'm facing right now so I'd have to
 

509
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,140
way I'm facing right now so I'd have to
like draw a line here and clear

510
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,150
like draw a line here and clear
 

511
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,250
like draw a line here and clear
everything left of it

512
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,260

 

513
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,520

so I'll probably just probably just

514
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,530
so I'll probably just probably just
 

515
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,190
so I'll probably just probably just
clear the grass so I just had another

516
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,200
clear the grass so I just had another
 

517
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,110
clear the grass so I just had another
thought about these collection holes

518
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,120
thought about these collection holes
 

519
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,890
thought about these collection holes
here I need them for the water streams

520
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:37,900
here I need them for the water streams
 

521
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,010
here I need them for the water streams
to run into and to bring items to but

522
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,020
to run into and to bring items to but
 

523
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,870
to run into and to bring items to but
one thing I don't really like about them

524
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
one thing I don't really like about them
 

525
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,159
one thing I don't really like about them
is I don't want to be falling into them

526
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:46,169
is I don't want to be falling into them
 

527
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,340
is I don't want to be falling into them
so I'm thinking I'm going to piston eyes

528
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,350
so I'm thinking I'm going to piston eyes
 

529
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:58,700
so I'm thinking I'm going to piston eyes
them to what I'll probably do loops is

530
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:58,710
them to what I'll probably do loops is
 

531
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,399
them to what I'll probably do loops is
put like a piston sticky piston here and

532
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:04,409
put like a piston sticky piston here and
 

533
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,890
put like a piston sticky piston here and
I'll have this kind of covered with half

534
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:07,900
I'll have this kind of covered with half
 

535
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,600
I'll have this kind of covered with half
slabs or something something that looks

536
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:09,610
slabs or something something that looks
 

537
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,549
slabs or something something that looks
good

538
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
good
 

539
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:21,149
good
definitely not cobblestone ones and now

540
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:21,159
definitely not cobblestone ones and now
 

541
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,230
definitely not cobblestone ones and now
that we can move ice no problem without

542
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
that we can move ice no problem without
 

543
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,789
that we can move ice no problem without
them creating water streams so normally

544
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:29,799
them creating water streams so normally
 

545
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:37,620
them creating water streams so normally
it'll just look like that and so the

546
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:37,630
it'll just look like that and so the
 

547
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,159
it'll just look like that and so the
idea is when I flick this lever to bring

548
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:41,169
idea is when I flick this lever to bring
 

549
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:45,990
idea is when I flick this lever to bring
I think the water streams come out first

550
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
I think the water streams come out first
 

551
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,340
I think the water streams come out first
thing that's going to happen is all

552
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,350
thing that's going to happen is all
 

553
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,760
thing that's going to happen is all
these ice blocks are going to move and

554
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:50,770
these ice blocks are going to move and
 

555
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,400
these ice blocks are going to move and
then the water is going to flow so

556
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,410
then the water is going to flow so
 

557
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:04,160
then the water is going to flow so
that's that's the new plan well we might

558
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,170
that's that's the new plan well we might
 

559
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,050
that's that's the new plan well we might
as well start working on the item piping

560
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,060
as well start working on the item piping
 

561
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,590
as well start working on the item piping
I guess so we need to get rid of this

562
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
I guess so we need to get rid of this
 

563
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,700
I guess so we need to get rid of this
line of ice blocks and we need to run

564
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:13,710
line of ice blocks and we need to run
 

565
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:29,120
line of ice blocks and we need to run
one underneath it first yeah so spiders

566
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,130
one underneath it first yeah so spiders
 

567
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,460
one underneath it first yeah so spiders
are going to go to spider drops are

568
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,470
are going to go to spider drops are
 

569
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,550
are going to go to spider drops are
going to go to the string too and these

570
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:34,560
going to go to the string too and these
 

571
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:52,000
going to go to the string too and these
ones also somehow and then this side

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,010
ones also somehow and then this side
 

573
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:59,180
ones also somehow and then this side
will be another line this is for the

574
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,190
will be another line this is for the
 

575
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:09,260
will be another line this is for the
passive ones oh you know I got a hurry

576
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,270
passive ones oh you know I got a hurry
 

577
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,730
passive ones oh you know I got a hurry
otherwise this water's going to freeze

578
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:10,740
otherwise this water's going to freeze
 

579
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,270
otherwise this water's going to freeze
again and it's already starting to okay

580
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
again and it's already starting to okay
 

581
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,590
again and it's already starting to okay
so I'm going to dig this out and then

582
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,600
so I'm going to dig this out and then
 

583
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,650
so I'm going to dig this out and then
we'll uh we'll be back now I'm just

584
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:24,660
we'll uh we'll be back now I'm just
 

585
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,330
we'll uh we'll be back now I'm just
cutting out the line we made we're going

586
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,340
cutting out the line we made we're going
 

587
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,490
cutting out the line we made we're going
to make like a little molding water in

588
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:33,500
to make like a little molding water in
 

589
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:45,380
to make like a little molding water in
to create new ice lower down I got the

590
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,390
to create new ice lower down I got the
 

591
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,050
to create new ice lower down I got the
molding finished now so we can place our

592
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,060
molding finished now so we can place our
 

593
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,510
molding finished now so we can place our
water in it and then we need to wait for

594
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:50,520
water in it and then we need to wait for
 

595
00:20:50,520 --> 00:21:02,700
water in it and then we need to wait for
it to freeze

596
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:02,710

 

597
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,730

this is a kind of kind of a weird thing

598
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:09,740
this is a kind of kind of a weird thing
 

599
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,139
this is a kind of kind of a weird thing
to be doing but we want a lower layer of

600
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:14,149
to be doing but we want a lower layer of
 

601
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,320
to be doing but we want a lower layer of
ice so that items move fast on it and

602
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,330
ice so that items move fast on it and
 

603
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,299
ice so that items move fast on it and
also so we can do so we don't need to go

604
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:22,309
also so we can do so we don't need to go
 

605
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:24,909
also so we can do so we don't need to go
down levels with our water screen to

606
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:24,919
down levels with our water screen to
 

607
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:41,220
down levels with our water screen to
carry the items for far distances and so

608
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,230

 

609
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,960

this stream is going to come around and

610
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:43,970
this stream is going to come around and
 

611
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,879
this stream is going to come around and
join with this one this one is going to

612
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:45,889
join with this one this one is going to
 

613
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,009
join with this one this one is going to
be going this way and then they're both

614
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:48,019
be going this way and then they're both
 

615
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,629
be going this way and then they're both
going to go together that way and this

616
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:52,639
going to go together that way and this
 

617
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,730
going to go together that way and this
one will also have squid in I don't know

618
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:54,740
one will also have squid in I don't know
 

619
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,919
one will also have squid in I don't know
let's technically a passive mob but I

620
00:21:58,919 --> 00:21:58,929
let's technically a passive mob but I
 

621
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:12,960
let's technically a passive mob but I
don't know it doesn't really matter good

622
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:12,970
don't know it doesn't really matter good
 

623
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,070
don't know it doesn't really matter good
okay so I'm going to fill another one

624
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,080
okay so I'm going to fill another one
 

625
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,930
okay so I'm going to fill another one
and I'm going to wait for this to freeze

626
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:16,940
and I'm going to wait for this to freeze
 

627
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,379
and I'm going to wait for this to freeze
see it's starting to already our giant

628
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:23,389
see it's starting to already our giant
 

629
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:26,019
see it's starting to already our giant
ice tray is frozen now so we're going to

630
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:26,029
ice tray is frozen now so we're going to
 

631
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,060
ice tray is frozen now so we're going to
do one last thing here we're going to

632
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,070
do one last thing here we're going to
 

633
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:34,799
do one last thing here we're going to
fill in the airspace with soil and then

634
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:34,809
fill in the airspace with soil and then
 

635
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,450
fill in the airspace with soil and then
we're going to put water over top and

636
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:37,460
we're going to put water over top and
 

637
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,970
we're going to put water over top and
have it freeze as well make two layers

638
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:39,980
have it freeze as well make two layers
 

639
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,210
have it freeze as well make two layers
of ice and then when we have two layers

640
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:46,220
of ice and then when we have two layers
 

641
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,669
of ice and then when we have two layers
we will go underneath and remove the

642
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:48,679
we will go underneath and remove the
 

643
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,830
we will go underneath and remove the
soil and place the water streams from

644
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:50,840
soil and place the water streams from
 

645
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:59,899
soil and place the water streams from
underneath instead of from above here

646
00:22:59,899 --> 00:22:59,909

 

647
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,019

so a little bit strange it's very

648
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:04,029
so a little bit strange it's very
 

649
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,820
so a little bit strange it's very
important I get to all my ice stuff

650
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:08,830
important I get to all my ice stuff
 

651
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,039
important I get to all my ice stuff
figured out before I put a roof on top

652
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,049
figured out before I put a roof on top
 

653
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,019
figured out before I put a roof on top
of this thing because when I have a roof

654
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:13,029
of this thing because when I have a roof
 

655
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:16,799
of this thing because when I have a roof
I won't be able to make ice freeze and I

656
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:16,809
I won't be able to make ice freeze and I
 

657
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,539
I won't be able to make ice freeze and I
also be got to be very careful now that

658
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:18,549
also be got to be very careful now that
 

659
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:21,869
also be got to be very careful now that
how I place my torches because if I melt

660
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:21,879
how I place my torches because if I melt
 

661
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,979
how I place my torches because if I melt
the ice underneath this ice it's going

662
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:25,989
the ice underneath this ice it's going
 

663
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:30,810
the ice underneath this ice it's going
to be a real pain to to make it turn to

664
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:30,820
to be a real pain to to make it turn to
 

665
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,639
to be a real pain to to make it turn to
make the water turn to ice in because

666
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:32,649
make the water turn to ice in because
 

667
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,159
make the water turn to ice in because
I'll have to remove the top layer of ice

668
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,169
I'll have to remove the top layer of ice
 

669
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,629
I'll have to remove the top layer of ice
add the bottom layer freeze and then

670
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:36,639
add the bottom layer freeze and then
 

671
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:41,539
add the bottom layer freeze and then
place the top layer again and it'll be a

672
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:41,549
place the top layer again and it'll be a
 

673
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:47,899
place the top layer again and it'll be a
be a big process if I'm not careful

674
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:47,909

 

675
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:51,200

there the floor is as good as new

676
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,210
there the floor is as good as new
 

677
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,369
there the floor is as good as new
so I started clearing out some of the

678
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:53,379
so I started clearing out some of the
 

679
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,289
so I started clearing out some of the
soil blocks in between the two ice

680
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:55,299
soil blocks in between the two ice
 

681
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,639
soil blocks in between the two ice
layers just from underneath here I'll

682
00:23:59,639 --> 00:23:59,649
layers just from underneath here I'll
 

683
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:03,419
layers just from underneath here I'll
probably replace the soil box you can

684
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:03,429
probably replace the soil box you can
 

685
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,330
probably replace the soil box you can
see from above with snow in the end of

686
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,340
see from above with snow in the end of
 

687
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,749
see from above with snow in the end of
things

688
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:06,759
things
 

689
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:14,489
things
I think that'll look better like but

690
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:14,499
I think that'll look better like but
 

691
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,710
I think that'll look better like but
yeah I need to place my water streams

692
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
yeah I need to place my water streams
 

693
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,879
yeah I need to place my water streams
from below here and it'll all flow to

694
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:23,889
from below here and it'll all flow to
 

695
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:29,279
from below here and it'll all flow to
the end here it's very very good

696
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,289
the end here it's very very good
 

697
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,599
the end here it's very very good
building this thing up high because it

698
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:30,609
building this thing up high because it
 

699
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,249
building this thing up high because it
makes doing all this stuff so much

700
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:32,259
makes doing all this stuff so much
 

701
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:39,450
makes doing all this stuff so much
easier I got to be very careful where I

702
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:39,460
easier I got to be very careful where I
 

703
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,310
easier I got to be very careful where I
place my torches now because I don't

704
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,320
place my torches now because I don't
 

705
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:49,249
place my torches now because I don't
want those ice blocks melting uh-huh

706
