technically took longer but that's like

98
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
technically took longer but that's like
 

99
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,069
technically took longer but that's like
a collective group of projects

100
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
a collective group of projects
 

101
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,270
a collective group of projects
not just a single one but uh things are

102
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
not just a single one but uh things are
 

103
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,069
not just a single one but uh things are
going good

104

going good
the way i've been doing it like we built

106
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
the way i've been doing it like we built
 

107
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,749
the way i've been doing it like we built
this first

108
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
this first
 

109
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,109
this first
section here right and we got this all

110
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
section here right and we got this all
 

111
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,350
section here right and we got this all
working we tried it out we tested it now

112
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
working we tried it out we tested it now
 

113
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,950
working we tried it out we tested it now
what i'm doing is i'm

114
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
what i'm doing is i'm
 

115
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,830
what i'm doing is i'm
i built like all seven things and i'm

116
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
i built like all seven things and i'm
 

117
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,910
i built like all seven things and i'm
piecing it together step by step like

118
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
piecing it together step by step like
 

119
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,510
piecing it together step by step like
instead of trying to build each one

120
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
instead of trying to build each one
 

121
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,030
instead of trying to build each one
individually then

122
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
individually then
 

123
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,550
individually then
moving on to the next one i'm just doing

124
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
moving on to the next one i'm just doing
 

125
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,070
moving on to the next one i'm just doing
like one step

126
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
like one step
 

127
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,990
like one step
in all of them and then i move on to the

128
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
in all of them and then i move on to the
 

129
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,589
in all of them and then i move on to the
next step kind of like an

130
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
next step kind of like an
 

131
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,750
next step kind of like an
assembly line that way i'm less likely

132
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
assembly line that way i'm less likely
 

133
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,750
assembly line that way i'm less likely
to make mistakes it's easier to memorize

134
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
to make mistakes it's easier to memorize
 

135
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,309
to make mistakes it's easier to memorize
like the redstone

136
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
like the redstone
 

137
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,869
like the redstone
and how i need to build its let's see

138
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
and how i need to build its let's see
 

139
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,470
and how i need to build its let's see
where was i

140
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
where was i
 

141
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,630
where was i
i forgot where i left off at we're not

142
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
i forgot where i left off at we're not
 

143
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,550
i forgot where i left off at we're not
done it but it's very close to done

144
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
done it but it's very close to done
 

145
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,790
done it but it's very close to done
oh yeah i was doing this row here

146
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800

 

147
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,710

so as far as materials go with this

148
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
so as far as materials go with this
 

149
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,869
so as far as materials go with this
project we're actually doing pretty good

150
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
project we're actually doing pretty good
 

151
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,790
project we're actually doing pretty good
like that was the main hold up

152
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
like that was the main hold up
 

153
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,990
like that was the main hold up
on the building and i think we have

154
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
on the building and i think we have
 

155
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,470
on the building and i think we have
enough redstone to finish this room i

156
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
enough redstone to finish this room i
 

157
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,509
enough redstone to finish this room i
think we may even have enough iron if we

158
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
think we may even have enough iron if we
 

159
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,229
think we may even have enough iron if we
dip into

160
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
dip into
 

161
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,070
dip into
my non-poppy farm supplies

162
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
my non-poppy farm supplies
 

163
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,390
my non-poppy farm supplies
um so the only thing we really need to

164
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
um so the only thing we really need to
 

165
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,309
um so the only thing we really need to
collect is maybe a bit of glass

166
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
collect is maybe a bit of glass
 

167
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,430
collect is maybe a bit of glass
and the big thing is the quartz

168
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
and the big thing is the quartz
 

169
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,470
and the big thing is the quartz
i have used up my supply of quartz so we

170
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
i have used up my supply of quartz so we
 

171
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,750
i have used up my supply of quartz so we
might look into getting some today

172
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
might look into getting some today
 

173
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,110
might look into getting some today
but i'm not entirely sure what we're

174
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
but i'm not entirely sure what we're
 

175
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,710
but i'm not entirely sure what we're
doing yet i'm just going to do a bit

176
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
doing yet i'm just going to do a bit
 

177
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,030
doing yet i'm just going to do a bit
more building

178
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
more building
 

179
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,589
more building
and then we will try to do something

180
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
and then we will try to do something
 

181
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,670
and then we will try to do something
else here

182
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
else here
 

183
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,670
else here
yes i decided to uh

184
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680

 

185
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,149

we have a friend here oh he got free he
 

187
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,390
we have a friend here oh he got free he
got free no

188
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
got free no
 

189
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,550
got free no
oh snap he was he was stuck in here he

190
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
oh snap he was he was stuck in here he
 

191
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,149
oh snap he was he was stuck in here he
must have got out

192
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159

 

193
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,630

all right i decided to go for a quartz

194
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
all right i decided to go for a quartz
 

195
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,190
all right i decided to go for a quartz
run

196
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
run
 

197
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,030
run
after all so in single player

198
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
after all so in single player
 

199
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,990
after all so in single player
of course i never carry a bow oh i just

200
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
of course i never carry a bow oh i just
 

201
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,229
of course i never carry a bow oh i just
did that

202
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
did that
 

203
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,350
did that
that's not good that's not good

204
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360

 

205
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,110

i will explain what i was going to say

206
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
i will explain what i was going to say
 

207
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,550
i will explain what i was going to say
in just a second

208
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
in just a second
 

209
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,750
in just a second
let me get some ender pearls

210
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
let me get some ender pearls
 

211
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,789
let me get some ender pearls
get to high ground

212
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
get to high ground
 

213
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,750
get to high ground
oops all right what i was going to say

214
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
oops all right what i was going to say
 

215
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,750
oops all right what i was going to say
for getting quartz in single player it's

216
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
for getting quartz in single player it's
 

217
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,869
for getting quartz in single player it's
probably quickest

218
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
probably quickest
 

219
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,949
probably quickest
to just like you know

220
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
to just like you know
 

221
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,270
to just like you know
get it from the surface here this is

222
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
get it from the surface here this is
 

223
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,270
get it from the surface here this is
gonna be impossible to do now on camera

224
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280

 

225
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,670

because uh we're fighting fighting a war

226
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
because uh we're fighting fighting a war
 

227
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,030
because uh we're fighting fighting a war
here now

228
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
here now
 

229
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,550
here now
apparently but yeah like just grabbing

230
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
apparently but yeah like just grabbing
 

231
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,990
apparently but yeah like just grabbing
stuff like this wherever you can

232
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
stuff like this wherever you can
 

233
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,749
stuff like this wherever you can
the only problem is it is very dangerous

234
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
the only problem is it is very dangerous
 

235
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,469
the only problem is it is very dangerous
up on the surface so what i wanted to

236
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
up on the surface so what i wanted to
 

237
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,670
up on the surface so what i wanted to
try

238
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
try
 

239
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,469
try
and this is especially probably good on

240
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
and this is especially probably good on
 

241
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,310
and this is especially probably good on
servers where

242
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
servers where
 

243
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,909
servers where
all the quartz has been mined out all

244
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
all the quartz has been mined out all
 

245
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,909
all the quartz has been mined out all
the easy to grab stuff

246
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
the easy to grab stuff
 

247
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,950
the easy to grab stuff
i want to try go down i'm going to block

248
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
i want to try go down i'm going to block
 

249
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,310
i want to try go down i'm going to block
this off because they are chasing me

250
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
this off because they are chasing me
 

251
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,150
this off because they are chasing me
right now

252
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
right now
 

253
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,430
right now
okay should be fine so if you go to the

254
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
okay should be fine so if you go to the
 

255
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,270
okay should be fine so if you go to the
top of the nether or the bottom it is

256
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
top of the nether or the bottom it is
 

257
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,029
top of the nether or the bottom it is
solid netherrack pretty much with the

258
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
solid netherrack pretty much with the
 

259
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,710
solid netherrack pretty much with the
odd cave running through

260
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720

 

261
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,310

let's see so let's go down to maybe why

262
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
let's see so let's go down to maybe why
 

263
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,029
let's see so let's go down to maybe why
here i'm going to fire fire potion i

264
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
here i'm going to fire fire potion i
 

265
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,070
here i'm going to fire fire potion i
also brought

266
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
also brought
 

267
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,510
also brought
night vision to try this i'm wondering

268
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
night vision to try this i'm wondering
 

269
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,510
night vision to try this i'm wondering
if speed mining is a good way of getting

270
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
if speed mining is a good way of getting
 

271
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,749
if speed mining is a good way of getting
quartz basically is what i'm getting at

272
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
quartz basically is what i'm getting at
 

273
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,950
quartz basically is what i'm getting at
here so that's what we're trying out

274
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
here so that's what we're trying out
 

275
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,710
here so that's what we're trying out
so the idea is you would probably get

276
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
so the idea is you would probably get
 

277
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,510
so the idea is you would probably get
like a speed potion

278
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
like a speed potion
 

279
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,110
like a speed potion
all right maybe night vision probably

280
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
all right maybe night vision probably
 

281
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,029
all right maybe night vision probably
fire resistance so that you don't run

282
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
fire resistance so that you don't run
 

283
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,189
fire resistance so that you don't run
into any of the lava pockets

284
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
into any of the lava pockets
 

285
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,710
into any of the lava pockets
and then you would get like a cheap

286
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
and then you would get like a cheap
 

287
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,550
and then you would get like a cheap
burner pick

288
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
burner pick
 

289
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,710
burner pick
probably efficiency two or three

290
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
probably efficiency two or three
 

291
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,710
probably efficiency two or three
unbreaking three then you get another

292
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
unbreaking three then you get another
 

293
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,590
unbreaking three then you get another
good pick

294
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
good pick
 

295
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,710
good pick
with silk touch on or fortune

296
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
with silk touch on or fortune
 

297
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,909
with silk touch on or fortune
for collecting the courts and let's just

298
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
for collecting the courts and let's just
 

299
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,670
for collecting the courts and let's just
see

300
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
see
 

301
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,670
see
if this is a viable way of collecting

302
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
if this is a viable way of collecting
 

303
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,870
if this is a viable way of collecting
quartz or not

304
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
quartz or not
 

305
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,510
quartz or not
because it would be totally safe right

306
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520

 

307
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,670

and a lot easier to do than than going

308
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
and a lot easier to do than than going
 

309
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,510

everything
 

315
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,029
everything
and that really stinks

316
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
and that really stinks
 

317
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,469
and that really stinks
it took us a little while to find this

to find a vein the good thing though is
 

363
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,629
to find a vein the good thing though is
these veins

364
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
these veins
 

365
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,469
these veins
should be their full size sometimes when

366
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
should be their full size sometimes when
 

367
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,309
should be their full size sometimes when
they spawn near

368
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
they spawn near
 

369
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,909

air air pockets uh

370
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919

the ore vein gets cut off right
 

373
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,790
the ore vein gets cut off right
so you should always find a big chunk

374
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
so you should always find a big chunk
 

375
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,189
so you should always find a big chunk
when you do find it

376
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
when you do find it
 

377
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,550
when you do find it
like sometimes it'll only be like one or

378
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
like sometimes it'll only be like one or
 

379
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,790
like sometimes it'll only be like one or
two pieces of quartz in a vein on the

380
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
two pieces of quartz in a vein on the
 

381
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,189
two pieces of quartz in a vein on the
surface here they should always be

382
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
surface here they should always be
 

383
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,830
surface here they should always be
like 10 or so

384
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

385
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,830

but i don't know if i would really do it

386
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
but i don't know if i would really do it
 

387
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,510
but i don't know if i would really do it
this way

388
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
this way
 

389
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,390
this way
it's not nearly efficient in terms of

390
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
it's not nearly efficient in terms of
 

391
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,629
it's not nearly efficient in terms of
picked your ability that's for sure

392
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639

 

393
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,909

i thought we found another one here it's

394
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
i thought we found another one here it's
 

395
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,390
i thought we found another one here it's
not too bad

396
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
not too bad
 

397
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,710
not too bad
ah yeah so i did it for a little bit

398
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
ah yeah so i did it for a little bit
 

399
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,430
ah yeah so i did it for a little bit
here

400
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
here
 

401
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,029
here
it was uh it was okay but

402
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
it was uh it was okay but
 

403
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,029
it was uh it was okay but
it was a lot slower than just going on

404
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
it was a lot slower than just going on
 

405
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,629
it was a lot slower than just going on
the surface so i wouldn't recommend it

406
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
the surface so i wouldn't recommend it
 

407
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,710
the surface so i wouldn't recommend it
unless you

408
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
unless you
 

409
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,309
unless you
if you just want to chill and take it

410
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
if you just want to chill and take it
 

411
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,309
if you just want to chill and take it
easy then it kind of is a good way of

412
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
easy then it kind of is a good way of
 

413
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,270
easy then it kind of is a good way of
getting quartz

414
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
getting quartz
 

415
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,110

425
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,510
um if you're on a server yeah you might
need to do that but in my single player

426
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
need to do that but in my single player
 

427
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,749
need to do that but in my single player
i do have to go about 500 to a thousand

428
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
i do have to go about 500 to a thousand
 

429
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,230
i do have to go about 500 to a thousand
blocks

430
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
blocks
 

431
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,950
blocks
out to get quartz because i generated my

432
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
out to get quartz because i generated my
 

433
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,830
out to get quartz because i generated my
nether before

434
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
nether before
 

435
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,629

441
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,589
but uh it's still easier just to go out
and find it

442
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
and find it
 

443
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,870

yeah i like that more actually uh i did

674
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
yeah i like that more actually uh i did
 

675
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,470
yeah i like that more actually uh i did
the floor down below a little different

676
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
the floor down below a little different
 

677
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,750
the floor down below a little different
too i made it totally

678
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
too i made it totally
 

679
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990
too i made it totally
out of this stuff because i ran out of

680
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
out of this stuff because i ran out of
 

681
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,190
out of this stuff because i ran out of
quartz

682
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
quartz
 

683
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,190
quartz
so i couldn't do it the way he did it

684
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
so i couldn't do it the way he did it
 

685
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,550
so i couldn't do it the way he did it
but i think it should be flat regardless

686
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
but i think it should be flat regardless
 

687
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,470
but i think it should be flat regardless
um but i might change that up a bit more

688
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
um but i might change that up a bit more
 

689
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,110
um but i might change that up a bit more

watching the frame rate as i've been

696
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
watching the frame rate as i've been
 

697
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,949

building this and it hasn't dropped too

698
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
building this and it hasn't dropped too
 

699
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,590

a bit of jitter but i still get well

704
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
a bit of jitter but i still get well
 

705
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,389
a bit of jitter but i still get well
over 120 frames per second when i'm here

706
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
over 120 frames per second when i'm here
 

707
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,750
over 120 frames per second when i'm here
and not recording so that's good um

708
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
and not recording so that's good um
 

709
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,509
and not recording so that's good um
and that's like with all the hoppers

00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
and that's like with all the hoppers
 

711
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,990

i think we have three rows we need to do
with hoppers yet

718
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
with hoppers yet
 

719
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,790
with hoppers yet
but they're almost all down that's

720
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
but they're almost all down that's
 

721
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,189

because you can't get to the enchanting

758
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
because you can't get to the enchanting
 

759
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,470
because you can't get to the enchanting
table from like this way

760
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
table from like this way
 

761
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,389
table from like this way
because the water is in the way you just

762
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
because the water is in the way you just
 

763
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,389
because the water is in the way you just
have this three wide walkway to get to

764
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
have this three wide walkway to get to
 

765
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,870
have this three wide walkway to get to
it and it's like

766
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
it and it's like
 

767
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,910
it and it's like
oh i don't know how to explain it it

768
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
oh i don't know how to explain it it
 

769

still have to keep it
 

781
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,509
still have to keep it
so uh in terms of the library though i

782
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
so uh in terms of the library though i
 

783
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,509
so uh in terms of the library though i
was trying to think what to do next

784
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
was trying to think what to do next
 

785
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,590
was trying to think what to do next
and probably should figure out where

786
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
and probably should figure out where
 

787
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,829
and probably should figure out where
we're going to put the back wall

788
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
we're going to put the back wall
 

789
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,189
we're going to put the back wall
and what we're doing with it so

790
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
and what we're doing with it so
 

791
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,870
and what we're doing with it so
i was thinking we're standing here right

792
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
i was thinking we're standing here right
 

793
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,189
i was thinking we're standing here right
the

794
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
the
 

795
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,790
the
back wall is only going to be a few more

796
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
back wall is only going to be a few more
 

797
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,870
back wall is only going to be a few more
blocks further that way

798
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
blocks further that way
 

799
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,150
blocks further that way
and for the middle we could do it either

800
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
and for the middle we could do it either
 

801
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,189
and for the middle we could do it either
two ways

802
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
two ways
 

803
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,030
two ways
uh i was thinking either having a big

804
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
uh i was thinking either having a big
 

805
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,030
uh i was thinking either having a big
giant window in the middle

806
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
giant window in the middle
 

807
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,189
giant window in the middle
and then like two statues one on each

808
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
and then like two statues one on each
 

809
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,949
and then like two statues one on each
side of that window

810
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
side of that window
 

811
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,150
side of that window
two tall statues or two

812
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
two tall statues or two
 

813
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,470
two tall statues or two
two things of highlight i guess i should

814
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
two things of highlight i guess i should
 

815
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,269
two things of highlight i guess i should
call it

816
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
call it
 

817
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,910
call it
or the other option is to have one thing

818
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
or the other option is to have one thing
 

819
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,550
or the other option is to have one thing
of

820
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
of
 

821
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,310
of
of highlight in the very middle and then

822
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
of highlight in the very middle and then
 

823
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,790
of highlight in the very middle and then
two giant windows

824
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
two giant windows
 

825
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,470
two giant windows
on each side so uh

826
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
on each side so uh
 

827
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,230
on each side so uh
not sure i think i might go for the two

828
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
not sure i think i might go for the two
 

829
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,230
not sure i think i might go for the two
windows and one

830
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
windows and one
 

831
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,710
windows and one
one big highlights in the center of the

832
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
one big highlights in the center of the
 

833
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,910
one big highlights in the center of the
room

834
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
room
 

835
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,790
room
um and for that highlight i was

836
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
um and for that highlight i was
 

837
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,430
um and for that highlight i was
considering

838
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
considering
 

839
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,910
considering
having an elder guardian bouncing up and

840
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
having an elder guardian bouncing up and
 

841
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,150
having an elder guardian bouncing up and
down i think that would be cool

842
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
down i think that would be cool
 

843
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,590
down i think that would be cool
so we'll plan for that but let's try

844
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
so we'll plan for that but let's try
 

845
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,790
so we'll plan for that but let's try
work this out so this

846
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
work this out so this
 

847
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,350
work this out so this
is sort of the border here maybe we will

848
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
is sort of the border here maybe we will
 

849
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,990
is sort of the border here maybe we will
go like

850
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
go like
 

851
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,189
go like
five blocks past that

852
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
five blocks past that
 

853
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,430
five blocks past that
i usually work with odd numbers so one

854
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
i usually work with odd numbers so one
 

855
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,870
i usually work with odd numbers so one
two three four five

856
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
two three four five
 

857
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,110
two three four five
and then maybe we will have another

858
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
and then maybe we will have another
 

859
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,670
and then maybe we will have another
border over here

860
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
border over here
 

861
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,189
border over here
and then like the window or

862
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
and then like the window or
 

863
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,430
and then like the window or
yeah windows over here then like at this

864
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
yeah windows over here then like at this
 

865
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,590
yeah windows over here then like at this
block spot

866
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
block spot
 

867
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,189
block spot
let's let me fill this in let's see what

868
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
let's let me fill this in let's see what
 

869
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,790
let's let me fill this in let's see what
that would look like

870
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
that would look like
 

871
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,230
that would look like
wait is that the right height

872
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240

 

873
00:16:48,240 --> 00:17:10,710

no let me go up one more block here

874
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720

 

875
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,470

all right so we're going to try this

876
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
all right so we're going to try this
 

877
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,029
all right so we're going to try this
layout for the back i kind of like it

878
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
layout for the back i kind of like it
 

879
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,150
layout for the back i kind of like it
this would be the window here and

880
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
this would be the window here and
 

881
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,710
this would be the window here and
there and this is like the center piece

882
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
there and this is like the center piece
 

883
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,309
there and this is like the center piece
this is where the elder guardian would

884
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
this is where the elder guardian would
 

885
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,069
this is where the elder guardian would
be bouncing up and down

886
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
be bouncing up and down
 

887
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,270
be bouncing up and down
so we probably want to locate

888
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
so we probably want to locate
 

889
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,510
so we probably want to locate
a three by three for that

890
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
a three by three for that
 

891
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,669
a three by three for that
he only needs a two by two but since

892
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
he only needs a two by two but since
 

893
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,510
he only needs a two by two but since
it's an odd number we need to go three

894
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
it's an odd number we need to go three
 

895
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,510
it's an odd number we need to go three
by three

896
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
by three
 

897
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,789
by three
to keep it centered properly uh there's

898
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
to keep it centered properly uh there's
 

899
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,390
to keep it centered properly uh there's
a lot of spruce up here too so i was

900
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
a lot of spruce up here too so i was
 

901
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,270
a lot of spruce up here too so i was
considering putting some more carpets

902
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
considering putting some more carpets
 

903
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,510
considering putting some more carpets
if not the carpet we got to change up

904
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
if not the carpet we got to change up
 

905
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,029
if not the carpet we got to change up
the wood colors a bit more

906
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
the wood colors a bit more
 

907
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,470
the wood colors a bit more
so it's not so overpowering it's all

908
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
so it's not so overpowering it's all
 

909
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,510
so it's not so overpowering it's all
spruce

910
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520

 

911
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,630

uh yeah maybe

912
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
uh yeah maybe
 

913
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,350
uh yeah maybe
but uh this is what's giving me trouble

914
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
but uh this is what's giving me trouble
 

915
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,350
but uh this is what's giving me trouble
i don't know what to make the back wall

916
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
i don't know what to make the back wall
 

917
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,150
i don't know what to make the back wall
out of like

918
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
out of like
 

919
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,029
out of like
this is probably what we would have on

920
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
this is probably what we would have on
 

921
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,950
this is probably what we would have on
the outside of the building here

922
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
the outside of the building here
 

923
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,190
the outside of the building here
so i don't know if i should go stone or

924
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
so i don't know if i should go stone or
 

925
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,390
so i don't know if i should go stone or
if i should go wood

926
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
if i should go wood
 

927
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,750
if i should go wood
or or what maybe clay

928
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
or or what maybe clay
 

929
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,270
or or what maybe clay
we'll try stone first

930
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
we'll try stone first
 

931
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,990
we'll try stone first
and just kind of roughly guess what the

932
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
and just kind of roughly guess what the
 

933
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,029
and just kind of roughly guess what the
window would look like

934
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
window would look like
 

935
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,750
window would look like
probably probably around here

936
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
probably probably around here
 

937
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,310
probably probably around here
and that's going to do about that shape

938
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
and that's going to do about that shape
 

939
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,070
and that's going to do about that shape
all right so then we'll do another one

940
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
all right so then we'll do another one
 

941
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,029
all right so then we'll do another one
over here

942
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039

 

943
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,150

and

944
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160

 

945
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,710

we'll do colored glass again i don't

946
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
we'll do colored glass again i don't
 

947
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,470
we'll do colored glass again i don't
know what color to use until we figure

948
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
know what color to use until we figure
 

949
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,470
know what color to use until we figure
out what block we're using here

950
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480

 

951
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,029

uh-huh okay bring this up

952
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
uh-huh okay bring this up
 

953
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,630

okay this i was going to build up i
 

967
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,070
okay this i was going to build up i
don't know if i want to build both them

968
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
don't know if i want to build both them
 

969
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,870
don't know if i want to build both them
up all the way either

970
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
up all the way either
 

971
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,150
up all the way either
but we'll go up to here

972
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
but we'll go up to here
 

973
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,150
but we'll go up to here
same with this

974
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160

 

975
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,270

this is dark wood right yeah spruce wood

976
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
this is dark wood right yeah spruce wood
 

977
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,669
this is dark wood right yeah spruce wood
and this

978
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
and this
 

979
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,710
and this
actually look pretty similar

980
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
actually look pretty similar
 

981
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,549
actually look pretty similar
sometimes i mix them up

982
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559

 

983
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,470

okay we're just going to finish up the

984
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
okay we're just going to finish up the
 

985
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,390
okay we're just going to finish up the
wood and then we'll take a look

986
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
wood and then we'll take a look
 

987
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,310
wood and then we'll take a look
so one more row and we'll decide if we

988
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
so one more row and we'll decide if we
 

989
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,270
so one more row and we'll decide if we
like it

990
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
like it
 

991
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,070
like it
or if we should try different colors oh

992
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
or if we should try different colors oh
 

993
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,909
or if we should try different colors oh
i think i went one too high there

994
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
i think i went one too high there
 

995
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,710
i think i went one too high there
okay so from a distance in the middle

996
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720

 

997
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,190

that's pretty good right i don't know if

998
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
that's pretty good right i don't know if
 

999
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,470
that's pretty good right i don't know if
i like the stone

1000
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480

 

1001
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,390

try to do one more thing
 

1139
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,630
try to do one more thing
at the library here the walls we have to

1140
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
at the library here the walls we have to
 

1141
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,390
at the library here the walls we have to
work out the walls

1142
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
work out the walls
 

1143
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,950
work out the walls
for up here i'm gonna have some some

1144
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
for up here i'm gonna have some some
 

1145
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,110
for up here i'm gonna have some some
book areas i think

1146
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
book areas i think
 

1147
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,070
book areas i think
um and i decided let's make this the

1148
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
um and i decided let's make this the
 

1149
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,669
um and i decided let's make this the
middle

1150
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
middle
 

1151
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,310
middle
and from the middle on the right and the

1152
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
and from the middle on the right and the
 

1153
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,149
and from the middle on the right and the
left i want it to curve

1154
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
left i want it to curve
 

1155
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,029
left i want it to curve
inward like this way just ever so

1156
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
inward like this way just ever so
 

1157
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,310
inward like this way just ever so
slightly so it's not completely flat

1158
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
slightly so it's not completely flat
 

1159
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,270
slightly so it's not completely flat
um so maybe we'll put a beam between

1160
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
um so maybe we'll put a beam between
 

1161
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,070
um so maybe we'll put a beam between
here and

1162
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
here and
 

1163
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,350
here and
here so let's find the middle one

1164
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
here so let's find the middle one
 

1165
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,470
here so let's find the middle one

four five six seven
 

1173
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,350
four five six seven
eight nine ten yeah why is it an even

1174
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
eight nine ten yeah why is it an even
 

1175
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,510
eight nine ten yeah why is it an even
number

1176
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
number
 

1177
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,190
number
this is odd this is odd here oh i got

1178
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
this is odd this is odd here oh i got
 

1179
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,950
this is odd this is odd here oh i got
i got two blocks here whoops

1180
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960

 

1181
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,710

uh that's fine we'll make it work um

1182
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
uh that's fine we'll make it work um
 

1183
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,549
uh that's fine we'll make it work um
okay so one two three four

1184
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
okay so one two three four
 

1185
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,870
okay so one two three four
five here and here that's the center

1186
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
five here and here that's the center
 

1187
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,549
five here and here that's the center
between the two

1188
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
between the two
 

1189
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,750
between the two
so if we're going to curve it inward

1190
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
so if we're going to curve it inward
 

1191
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,350
so if we're going to curve it inward
let's bring this up keep it flat

1192
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
let's bring this up keep it flat
 

1193
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,590
let's bring this up keep it flat
and i guess we'll put one post here

1194
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
and i guess we'll put one post here
 

1195
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,590
and i guess we'll put one post here
and then the other one here is that

1196
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
and then the other one here is that
 

1197
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,830
and then the other one here is that
going to work is this too tight

1198
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
going to work is this too tight
 

1199
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,029
going to work is this too tight
on this corner here no that's fine

1200
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
on this corner here no that's fine
 

1201
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,590
on this corner here no that's fine
that works out yeah so then we'll have

1202
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
that works out yeah so then we'll have
 

1203
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,390
that works out yeah so then we'll have
it

1204
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
it
 

1205
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,510
it
up here and then i think that would be

1206
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
up here and then i think that would be
 

1207
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,590
up here and then i think that would be
pretty cool

1208
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
pretty cool
 

1209
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,909
pretty cool
you see what i'm doing i'm not really

1210
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
you see what i'm doing i'm not really
 

1211
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,430
you see what i'm doing i'm not really
explaining this too well let's let's

1212
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
explaining this too well let's let's
 

1213
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,710
explaining this too well let's let's
take this out

1214
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
take this out
 

1215
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,149
take this out
we'll replace this with the logs as well

1216
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
we'll replace this with the logs as well
 

1217
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,669
we'll replace this with the logs as well
all right and then i want these like

1218
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
all right and then i want these like
 

1219
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,870
all right and then i want these like
little compartments with bookshelves in

1220
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
little compartments with bookshelves in
 

1221
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,710
little compartments with bookshelves in
maybe now i don't want it totally flat

1222
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
maybe now i don't want it totally flat
 

1223
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,310
maybe now i don't want it totally flat
like i don't want to put them here

1224
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
like i don't want to put them here
 

1225
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,510
like i don't want to put them here
we want more 3d depth to them so i'm

1226
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
we want more 3d depth to them so i'm
 

1227
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,110
we want more 3d depth to them so i'm
going to put them one more block

1228
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
going to put them one more block
 

1229
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,950
going to put them one more block
back i think and we probably want it at

1230
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
back i think and we probably want it at
 

1231
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,190
back i think and we probably want it at
least three blocks tall

1232
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200

 

1233
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,870

anything less than that it feels kind of

1234
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
anything less than that it feels kind of
 

1235
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,230
anything less than that it feels kind of
cramped

1236
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240

 

1237
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,630

okay so we'll do that seems like we'll

1238
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
okay so we'll do that seems like we'll
 

1239
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,070
okay so we'll do that seems like we'll
have to hide some lighting under the

1240
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
have to hide some lighting under the
 

1241
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,149
have to hide some lighting under the
carpet here too

1242
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
carpet here too
 

1243
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,430
carpet here too
actually i can probably do that right

1244
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
actually i can probably do that right
 

1245
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,510
actually i can probably do that right
now

1246
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
now
 

1247
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,870
now
yeah i like that

1248
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
yeah i like that
 

1249
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,470
yeah i like that
and do that very good okay so let's take

1250
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
and do that very good okay so let's take
 

1251
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,710
and do that very good okay so let's take
these out

1252
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
these out
 

1253
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,549
these out
to highlight the area again we're going

1254
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
to highlight the area again we're going
 

1255
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,310
to highlight the area again we're going
to be using oak wood

1256

to be using oak wood
 

1257
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,390
to be using oak wood
so that's the highlight color that were

1258
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
so that's the highlight color that were
 

1259
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,990
so that's the highlight color that were
that we've chosen

1260
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000

 

1261
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,029

our librarian villagers because they're
 

1317
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,710
our librarian villagers because they're

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
going to need a lot of space
 

1319

and there's going to be a lot of space
 

1321
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,350
and there's going to be a lot of space
up here on both sides

1322
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
up here on both sides
 

1323
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,710
up here on both sides
these leaves by the way if you were

1324
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
these leaves by the way if you were
 

1325
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,310
these leaves by the way if you were
wondering about them i probably should

1326
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
wondering about them i probably should
 

1327
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,669
wondering about them i probably should
have said this sooner

1328
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
have said this sooner
 

1329
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,430
have said this sooner
but they're preventing the water from

1330
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
but they're preventing the water from
 

1331
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,190
but they're preventing the water from
freezing down there so it's just a

1332
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
freezing down there so it's just a
 

1333
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,110
freezing down there so it's just a
temporary thing

1334
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120

 

1335
