150
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:54,660
compare the axe to the sword this is
 

151
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,160
compare the axe to the sword this is
only for tech damage compared to seven

152
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,170
only for tech damage compared to seven
 

153
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,620
only for tech damage compared to seven
but the sword has better speed so that's

154
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:00,630
but the sword has better speed so that's
 

155
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,500
but the sword has better speed so that's
kind of the big thing there but the the

156
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,510
kind of the big thing there but the the

hoe is really interesting it's won and

158
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:06,870
hoe is really interesting it's won and
 

159
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,550
hoe is really interesting it's won and
won all the gold tools have the same

160
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
won all the gold tools have the same
 

161
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
won all the gold tools have the same
stats as the wood tool so it's basically

162
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,290
stats as the wood tool so it's basically
 

163
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,550
stats as the wood tool so it's basically
the same if you hop over to the stone

164
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
the same if you hop over to the stone
 

165
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,590
the same if you hop over to the stone
now look at what the hoe does it goes 1

166
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
now look at what the hoe does it goes 1
 

167
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,550
now look at what the hoe does it goes 1
and 1 and then 2 and 1 3 and 1 4 and 1

168
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
and 1 and then 2 and 1 3 and 1 4 and 1
 

169
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,530
and 1 and then 2 and 1 3 and 1 4 and 1
so it goes up by one for each for the

170
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
so it goes up by one for each for the
 

171
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,680
so it goes up by one for each for the
speed all these other things they'll go

172
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,690
speed all these other things they'll go
 

173
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,080
speed all these other things they'll go
up by attack damage not by speed so that

174
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,090
up by attack damage not by speed so that
 

175
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,560
up by attack damage not by speed so that
the the wood tier is one point two and

176
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,570
the the wood tier is one point two and
 

177
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,830
the the wood tier is one point two and
two then it goes three attack damage for

178
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
two then it goes three attack damage for
 

179
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,110
two then it goes three attack damage for
five so it goes up by one for each and

180
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
five so it goes up by one for each and
 

181
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
five so it goes up by one for each and
then these again it goes up by one on

182
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,250
then these again it goes up by one on
 

183
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,070
then these again it goes up by one on
attack damage 8 9 10 4 5 6 7

184
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
attack damage 8 9 10 4 5 6 7
 

185
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
attack damage 8 9 10 4 5 6 7
so the hoes only one that goes up by

186
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,090
so the hoes only one that goes up by
 

187
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,909
so the hoes only one that goes up by
attack speed so if you could apply a

188
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:52,919
attack speed so if you could apply a
 

189
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,930
attack speed so if you could apply a
sharpness effect to a hoe it would

190
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
sharpness effect to a hoe it would
 

191
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,690
sharpness effect to a hoe it would
probably be the best weapon just because

192
00:04:59,690 --> 00:04:59,700
probably be the best weapon just because
 

193
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,090
probably be the best weapon just because
it's got that speed boost as well but as

194
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,100
it's got that speed boost as well but as
 

195
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,839
it's got that speed boost as well but as
far as I know you still can't put

196
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:05,849
far as I know you still can't put
 

197
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,820
far as I know you still can't put
enchantments on

198
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:07,830
enchantments on
 

199
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,400
enchantments on
oh right yeah it's just exit out right

200
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,410
oh right yeah it's just exit out right
 

201
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,150
oh right yeah it's just exit out right
away does this tell you the change oh it

202
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
away does this tell you the change oh it
 

203
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,610
away does this tell you the change oh it
does tell you the change after or in the

204
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:16,620
does tell you the change after or in the
 

205
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,220
does tell you the change after or in the
anvil itself so it goes from seven to

206
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,230
anvil itself so it goes from seven to
 

207
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,920
anvil itself so it goes from seven to
ten point seven five with sharpness

208
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:21,930
ten point seven five with sharpness
 

209
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,590
ten point seven five with sharpness
three think each level of sharpness

210
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
three think each level of sharpness
 

211
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,010
three think each level of sharpness
increases it by one point two five is

212
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
increases it by one point two five is
 

213
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,640
increases it by one point two five is
that right

214
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:28,650
that right
 

215
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,630
that right
yeah uh-huh but the tack speed stays the

216
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:32,640
yeah uh-huh but the tack speed stays the
 

217
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,130
yeah uh-huh but the tack speed stays the
same

218
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,140
same
 

219
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,890
same
oops I noticed like with enchanted picks

220
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:36,900
oops I noticed like with enchanted picks
 

221
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,920
oops I noticed like with enchanted picks
and and regular picks the attack speed

222
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:39,930
and and regular picks the attack speed
 

223
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,770
and and regular picks the attack speed
stays the same efficiency doesn't make

224
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:42,780
stays the same efficiency doesn't make
 

225
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,790
stays the same efficiency doesn't make
it faster anything like that one thing I

226
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
it faster anything like that one thing I
 

227
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,350
it faster anything like that one thing I
was wondering you know the gold tools

228
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,360
was wondering you know the gold tools
 

229
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,970
was wondering you know the gold tools
always had that a special ability of

230
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:49,980
always had that a special ability of
 

231
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,120
always had that a special ability of
being faster miners than than other

232
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,130
being faster miners than than other
 

233
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,020
being faster miners than than other
tools I wonder if that's all the same

234
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,030
tools I wonder if that's all the same
 

235
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,690
tools I wonder if that's all the same
good I think that the speed the tack

236
00:05:59,690 --> 00:05:59,700
good I think that the speed the tack
 

237
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,400
good I think that the speed the tack
speed only applies to combat not

238
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,410
speed only applies to combat not
 

239
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,640
speed only applies to combat not
actually harvesting right that's wood

240
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:04,650
actually harvesting right that's wood
 

241
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,090
actually harvesting right that's wood
oh yeah it's still fast ah very good

242
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,100
oh yeah it's still fast ah very good
 

243
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,230
oh yeah it's still fast ah very good
very good okay so I was curious about

244
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
very good okay so I was curious about
 

245
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,630
very good okay so I was curious about
something guys I got out my calculator

246
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:14,640
something guys I got out my calculator
 

247
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,970
something guys I got out my calculator
here I was trying to figure out in like

248
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:16,980
here I was trying to figure out in like
 

249
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,550
here I was trying to figure out in like
straight DPS damage per second how the

250
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560
straight DPS damage per second how the
 

251
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,150
straight DPS damage per second how the
sword and the axe actually compare and

252
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
sword and the axe actually compare and
 

253
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,920
sword and the axe actually compare and
in general like if you don't factor in

254
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:24,930
in general like if you don't factor in
 

255
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,820
in general like if you don't factor in
shields swords basically win except for

256
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:28,830
shields swords basically win except for
 

257
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,190
shields swords basically win except for
the wood and gold tier they don't do as

258
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,200
the wood and gold tier they don't do as
 

259
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,910
the wood and gold tier they don't do as
much damage as the axe in DPS but then

260
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:34,920
much damage as the axe in DPS but then
 

261
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,270
much damage as the axe in DPS but then
at stone and plus the sword is better

262
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
at stone and plus the sword is better
 

263
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,740
at stone and plus the sword is better
and here's why this is what's

264
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:39,750
and here's why this is what's
 

265
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,080
and here's why this is what's
interesting about it so if you compare

266
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,090
interesting about it so if you compare
 

267
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,170
interesting about it so if you compare
the tack damage at the wood level sword

268
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,180
the tack damage at the wood level sword
 

269
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,610
the tack damage at the wood level sword
is for the X is seven seven divided by

270
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
is for the X is seven seven divided by
 

271
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,270
is for the X is seven seven divided by
four you'll find the axes 1.75 times

272
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
four you'll find the axes 1.75 times
 

273
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,560
four you'll find the axes 1.75 times
stronger than the sword but as you go

274
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,570
stronger than the sword but as you go
 

275
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,460
stronger than the sword but as you go
down the line as they get stronger um if

276
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,470
down the line as they get stronger um if
 

277
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,410
down the line as they get stronger um if
you look at the diamond tier 10 divided

278
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:03,420
you look at the diamond tier 10 divided
 

279
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,430
you look at the diamond tier 10 divided
by seven that's no longer 1.75 the ratio

280
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,440
by seven that's no longer 1.75 the ratio
 

281
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,140
by seven that's no longer 1.75 the ratio
becomes closer and closer together and

282
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,150
becomes closer and closer together and
 

283
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,540
becomes closer and closer together and
if you look at the max possible like

284
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,550
if you look at the max possible like
 

285
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,520
if you look at the max possible like
that the diamond axe for example it does

286
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,530
that the diamond axe for example it does
 

287
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,370
that the diamond axe for example it does
ten attack damage so that's our base ten

288
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,380
ten attack damage so that's our base ten
 

289
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,320
ten attack damage so that's our base ten
damage plus annoying music

290
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,330
damage plus annoying music
 

291
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,390
damage plus annoying music
6.25 you can get from sharpness 5 every

292
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
6.25 you can get from sharpness 5 every
 

293
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,409
6.25 you can get from sharpness 5 every
level adds 1.25 and then in addition you

294
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:29,419
level adds 1.25 and then in addition you
 

295
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,810
level adds 1.25 and then in addition you
can also get 6 damage from a strength to

296
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:31,820
can also get 6 damage from a strength to
 

297
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,770
can also get 6 damage from a strength to
potion now they rebounce rebounce those

298
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:34,780
potion now they rebounce rebounce those
 

299
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,409
potion now they rebounce rebounce those
so that equals do I fail math I think

300
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:38,419
so that equals do I fail math I think
 

301
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:43,719
so that equals do I fail math I think
that's 20 2.25 for the axe now the sword

302
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:43,729
that's 20 2.25 for the axe now the sword
 

303
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,620
that's 20 2.25 for the axe now the sword
is 19.2 5 because it does 3 damage less

304
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:47,630
is 19.2 5 because it does 3 damage less
 

305
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,020
is 19.2 5 because it does 3 damage less
and that ratio is much closer together

306
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,030
and that ratio is much closer together
 

307
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,240
and that ratio is much closer together
that works out to I figured it out my

308
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,250
that works out to I figured it out my
 

309
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,680
that works out to I figured it out my
calculator already about 1.15 times

310
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,690
calculator already about 1.15 times
 

311
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,290
calculator already about 1.15 times
stronger than the sword compared to the

312
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,300
stronger than the sword compared to the
 

313
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,040
stronger than the sword compared to the
1.75 we started with so as you get a

314
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,050
1.75 we started with so as you get a
 

315
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,110
1.75 we started with so as you get a
better weapon the sword gets better and

316
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,120
better weapon the sword gets better and
 

317
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,260
better weapon the sword gets better and
better in comparison to the to the axe

318
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,270
better in comparison to the to the axe
 

319
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,020
better in comparison to the to the axe
umm but that doesn't factor in the

320
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,030
umm but that doesn't factor in the
 

321
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,129
umm but that doesn't factor in the
attack speed either if you look at DPS

322
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:17,139
attack speed either if you look at DPS
 

323
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:23,290
attack speed either if you look at DPS
it's 0.9 compared to 1.45 so assuming

324
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,300
it's 0.9 compared to 1.45 so assuming
 

325
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,540
it's 0.9 compared to 1.45 so assuming
that means 1.45 divided by 0.9 is how

326
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,550
that means 1.45 divided by 0.9 is how
 

327
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,980
that means 1.45 divided by 0.9 is how
much you have to adjust it which is 1.6

328
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:32,990
much you have to adjust it which is 1.6
 

329
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,709
much you have to adjust it which is 1.6
1 1 I like this kind of stuff guys I'm

330
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:35,719
1 1 I like this kind of stuff guys I'm
 

331
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,510
1 1 I like this kind of stuff guys I'm
sorry the sword gets a 1.6 1 1 x boost

332
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:40,520
sorry the sword gets a 1.6 1 1 x boost
 

333
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,970
sorry the sword gets a 1.6 1 1 x boost
over the ax so yeah at the max the 19.2

334
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:45,980
over the ax so yeah at the max the 19.2
 

335
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,600
over the ax so yeah at the max the 19.2
5 yet you times it by the 1.6 one one

336
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:51,610
5 yet you times it by the 1.6 one one
 

337
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,240
5 yet you times it by the 1.6 one one
was its yeah and that's higher than the

338
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,250
was its yeah and that's higher than the
 

339
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,820
was its yeah and that's higher than the
22 points to 5 or whatever anyway so

340
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:00,830
22 points to 5 or whatever anyway so
 

341
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,800
22 points to 5 or whatever anyway so
interesting when you factor in the

342
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:02,810
interesting when you factor in the
 

343
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,949
interesting when you factor in the
attack speed at the would tear the DPS

344
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:05,959
attack speed at the would tear the DPS
 

345
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,410
attack speed at the would tear the DPS
of the ax is actually better than the

346
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:08,420
of the ax is actually better than the
 

347
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,019
of the ax is actually better than the
sword so it's like just in general

348
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:11,029
sword so it's like just in general
 

349
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,740
sword so it's like just in general
better at the stone tier if you factor

350
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:14,750
better at the stone tier if you factor
 

351
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,449
better at the stone tier if you factor
in the tack speed it's eight point zero

352
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:16,459
in the tack speed it's eight point zero
 

353
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,090
in the tack speed it's eight point zero
five attack damage so they're basically

354
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,100
five attack damage so they're basically
 

355
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,970
five attack damage so they're basically
the same except you know obviously it's

356
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:21,980
the same except you know obviously it's
 

357
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,769
the same except you know obviously it's
better to only have to attack a guy once

358
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:23,779
better to only have to attack a guy once
 

359
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,420
better to only have to attack a guy once
instead of twice like you might need to

360
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:25,430
instead of twice like you might need to
 

361
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,639
instead of twice like you might need to
with a sword so I would still pick a

362
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:27,649
with a sword so I would still pick a
 

363
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,850
with a sword so I would still pick a
stone axe over a stone sword beyond that

364
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:30,860
stone axe over a stone sword beyond that
 

365
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,810
stone axe over a stone sword beyond that
you know it's the ax still has a pretty

366
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:34,820
you know it's the ax still has a pretty
 

367
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,560
you know it's the ax still has a pretty
strongly

368
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,570
strongly
 

369
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,750
strongly
I would say but it gets less and less as

370
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
I would say but it gets less and less as
 

371
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,060
I would say but it gets less and less as
the damage goes up the thing about the

372
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,070
the damage goes up the thing about the
 

373
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,820
the damage goes up the thing about the
AK so apparently they made it so if you

374
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:42,830
AK so apparently they made it so if you
 

375
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,120
AK so apparently they made it so if you
hit a guy and he has a shield out it

376
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,130
hit a guy and he has a shield out it
 

377
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,250
hit a guy and he has a shield out it
will stun the shield for five seconds so

378
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,260
will stun the shield for five seconds so
 

379
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,080
will stun the shield for five seconds so
they can't use it to block your attack

380
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,090
they can't use it to block your attack
 

381
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,420
they can't use it to block your attack
so what you would want to do like if you

382
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,430
so what you would want to do like if you
 

383
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,610
so what you would want to do like if you
have a high damage axe and high damage

384
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:54,620
have a high damage axe and high damage
 

385
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,430
have a high damage axe and high damage
sword is just tap them once with axe and

386
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
sword is just tap them once with axe and
 

387
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,690
sword is just tap them once with axe and
switch over to your sword and finish

388
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:01,700
switch over to your sword and finish
 

389
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,880
switch over to your sword and finish
them off with that if they're like in

390
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:03,890
them off with that if they're like in
 

391
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,400
them off with that if they're like in
the same same league as each other that

392
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,410
the same same league as each other that
 

393
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,240
the same same league as each other that
would be the ideal but another really

394
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,250
would be the ideal but another really
 

395
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,640
would be the ideal but another really
interesting thing I thought is they

396
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:12,650
interesting thing I thought is they
 

397
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,070
interesting thing I thought is they
buffed weakness potions as well so it's

398
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,080
buffed weakness potions as well so it's
 

399
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,580
buffed weakness potions as well so it's
- for attack damage now instead of the

400
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:18,590
- for attack damage now instead of the
 

401
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,430
- for attack damage now instead of the
zero point or I think it was one one

402
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
zero point or I think it was one one
 

403
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,520
zero point or I think it was one one
attack damage they reduced before so if

404
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:24,530
attack damage they reduced before so if
 

405
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,260
attack damage they reduced before so if
you hit someone with a weakness potion

406
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,270
you hit someone with a weakness potion
 

407
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,910
you hit someone with a weakness potion
they're using a wood sword for example

408
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
they're using a wood sword for example
 

409
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,250
they're using a wood sword for example
they'll do no damage to you compared to

410
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,260
they'll do no damage to you compared to
 

411
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,770
they'll do no damage to you compared to
the three damage he would do with an X

412
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:32,780
the three damage he would do with an X
 

413
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,820
the three damage he would do with an X
and then one two four two two five three

414
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:36,830
and then one two four two two five three
 

415
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,380
and then one two four two two five three
two six you know um income oh wait I got

416
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,390
two six you know um income oh wait I got
 

417
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,750
two six you know um income oh wait I got
that messed up anyway

418
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:42,760
that messed up anyway
 

419
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,390
that messed up anyway
in comparison the weakness potions have

420
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,400
in comparison the weakness potions have
 

421
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,250
in comparison the weakness potions have
a much bigger effect on someone using a

422
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,260
a much bigger effect on someone using a
 

423
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,120
a much bigger effect on someone using a
sword than an axe and just one more

424
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,130
sword than an axe and just one more
 

425
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,530
sword than an axe and just one more
thing I wanted to show you guys and

426
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:53,540
thing I wanted to show you guys and
 

427
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,380
thing I wanted to show you guys and
we'll do something else is I was curious

428
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,390
we'll do something else is I was curious
 

429
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,210
we'll do something else is I was curious
about the attack speed what this number

430
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,220
about the attack speed what this number
 

431
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,950
about the attack speed what this number
actually means and if you if you attack

432
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:02,960
actually means and if you if you attack
 

433
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,020
actually means and if you if you attack
with a weapon like let's take the axe

434
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,030
with a weapon like let's take the axe
 

435
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,720
with a weapon like let's take the axe
for example when I left click it takes

436
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:07,730
for example when I left click it takes
 

437
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,580
for example when I left click it takes
it a little bit of time you see that for

438
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,590
it a little bit of time you see that for
 

439
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,650
it a little bit of time you see that for
it to get fully charged up back in its

440
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:11,660
it to get fully charged up back in its
 

441
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,550
it to get fully charged up back in its
normal position like so you can still

442
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:15,560
normal position like so you can still
 

443
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,410
normal position like so you can still
spam click though if you want but it

444
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,420
spam click though if you want but it
 

445
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,000
spam click though if you want but it
does very little damage if you don't

446
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,010
does very little damage if you don't
 

447
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,060
does very little damage if you don't
wait for it to fully charge up and every

448
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,070
wait for it to fully charge up and every
 

449
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,650
wait for it to fully charge up and every
weapon has a different speed like if you

450
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:23,660
weapon has a different speed like if you
 

451
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,810
weapon has a different speed like if you
look at the hole for example look how

452
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:25,820
look at the hole for example look how
 

453
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,540
look at the hole for example look how
fast that that gets ready between

454
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:28,550
fast that that gets ready between
 

455
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,460
fast that that gets ready between
attacks it's like almost instant

456
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,470
attacks it's like almost instant
 

457
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,640
attacks it's like almost instant
compared to the the axe here right

458
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,650
compared to the the axe here right
 

459
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,340
compared to the the axe here right
so I actually figured out the numbers

460
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,350
so I actually figured out the numbers
 

461
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,430
so I actually figured out the numbers
for a single attack with the pick these

462
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
for a single attack with the pick these
 

463
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,610
for a single attack with the pick these
are the diamond tools I checked is zero

464
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:42,620
are the diamond tools I checked is zero
 

465
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
are the diamond tools I checked is zero
point six six seven seconds the shovel

466
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:44,630
point six six seven seconds the shovel
 

467
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,420
point six six seven seconds the shovel
is 0.833

468
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,430
is 0.833
 

469
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,970
is 0.833
x zero point nine three three swords

470
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:48,980
x zero point nine three three swords
 

471
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,390
x zero point nine three three swords
zero

472
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,400
zero
 

473
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,510
zero
point six zero zero and the ho is zero

474
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,520

you could make a way of transporting

936
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,210
you could make a way of transporting
 

937
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,049
you could make a way of transporting
with these like if you could isolate it

938
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:15,059
with these like if you could isolate it
 

939
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,060
with these like if you could isolate it
so you only have one spot to teleport to

940
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,070
so you only have one spot to teleport to
 

941
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,039
so you only have one spot to teleport to
and then you close off the spot where

942
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,049
and then you close off the spot where
 

943
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,960
and then you close off the spot where
you started so you can't teleport back

944
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:20,970
you started so you can't teleport back
 

945
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,440
you started so you can't teleport back
you could actually make a road but I

you could actually make a road but I
 

947
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,299
you could actually make a road but I
don't know how to make it so you don't

948
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:26,309
don't know how to make it so you don't
 

949
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:32,570
don't know how to make it so you don't
teleport to the ground like that

950
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:32,580

 

951
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,220

okay well I decided let's try this one

952
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,230
okay well I decided let's try this one
 

953
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,169
okay well I decided let's try this one
more time I went even higher in the sky

954
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:37,179
more time I went even higher in the sky
 

955
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,940
more time I went even higher in the sky
now so we're 175 at the y-coordinate and

956
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:40,950
now so we're 175 at the y-coordinate and
 

957
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,350
now so we're 175 at the y-coordinate and
since I was up here I decided to try out

958
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
since I was up here I decided to try out
 

959
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,889
since I was up here I decided to try out
the 32 chunk render distance you know

960
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:46,899
the 32 chunk render distance you know
 

961
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:51,180
the 32 chunk render distance you know
what it's not bad actually before when I

962
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,190
what it's not bad actually before when I
 

963
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,549
what it's not bad actually before when I
would use the 32 chunk my game which is

964
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:53,559
would use the 32 chunk my game which is
 

965
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,310
would use the 32 chunk my game which is
like all the time right now it takes a

966
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
like all the time right now it takes a
 

967
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,049
like all the time right now it takes a
really long time for the chunks to load

968
00:25:58,049 --> 00:25:58,059
really long time for the chunks to load
 

969
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,529
really long time for the chunks to load
it seems to do it as it can but it my

970
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:01,539
it seems to do it as it can but it my
 

971
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:04,680
it seems to do it as it can but it my
framerate doesn't drop terribly as it's

972
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:04,690
framerate doesn't drop terribly as it's
 

973
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,629
framerate doesn't drop terribly as it's
loading them it still really smooth the

974
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:06,639
loading them it still really smooth the
 

975
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:09,299
loading them it still really smooth the
whole time so I kind of like that

976
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:09,309
whole time so I kind of like that
 

977
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:12,210
whole time so I kind of like that
actually I think once everything is

978
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,220
actually I think once everything is
 

979
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,590
actually I think once everything is
loaded then it's fine but I shall don't

980
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:16,600
loaded then it's fine but I shall don't
 

981
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,480
loaded then it's fine but I shall don't
see any more chunks loading it might be

982
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,490
see any more chunks loading it might be
 

983
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,419
see any more chunks loading it might be
done anyways let's see if we can get to
