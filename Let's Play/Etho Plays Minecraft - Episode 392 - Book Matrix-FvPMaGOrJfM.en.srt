15
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,089
blabbing on here I'm gonna enjoy them
but first I got to record my intro so we

16
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:29,099
but first I got to record my intro so we
 

17
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,580
but first I got to record my intro so we
are over at the library here and last

18
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:31,590
are over at the library here and last
 

19
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,010
are over at the library here and last
episode I got this thing wired up I was

20
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,020
episode I got this thing wired up I was
 

21
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,470
episode I got this thing wired up I was
actually really happy to to get that

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
actually really happy to to get that
 

23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,840
actually really happy to to get that
done I don't know if it came across is

24
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:38,850
done I don't know if it came across is
 

25
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,110
done I don't know if it came across is
that but I I kind of been fearful I

26
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
that but I I kind of been fearful I
 

27
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,400
that but I I kind of been fearful I
wouldn't be able to do this and it

28
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,410
wouldn't be able to do this and it
 

29
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,400
wouldn't be able to do this and it
actually seems to have turned out okay

30
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,410
actually seems to have turned out okay
 

31
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,200
actually seems to have turned out okay
so I'm gonna cut be referring to this as

32
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,210
so I'm gonna cut be referring to this as
 

33
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,319
so I'm gonna cut be referring to this as
the book matrix okay it's not done just

34
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:51,329
the book matrix okay it's not done just
 

35
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,970
the book matrix okay it's not done just
yet we got it wired but we still have to

36
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:52,980
yet we got it wired but we still have to
 

37
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,029
yet we got it wired but we still have to
do a few things with it so the point of

38
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:56,039
do a few things with it so the point of
 

39
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,000
do a few things with it so the point of
this thing it's going to hold all our

40
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,010
this thing it's going to hold all our
 

41
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,180
this thing it's going to hold all our
enchanted books for the library here

42
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,190
enchanted books for the library here
 

43
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,910
enchanted books for the library here
right it's storage for them but it's

44
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:04,920
right it's storage for them but it's
 

45
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,820
right it's storage for them but it's
also a retrieval system for them so we

46
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
also a retrieval system for them so we
 

47
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,370
also a retrieval system for them so we
push a button over there and it's got to

48
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,380
push a button over there and it's got to
 

49
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,170
push a button over there and it's got to
deliver the books to us the one we

50
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,180
deliver the books to us the one we
 

51
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,499
deliver the books to us the one we
choose right so we got a couple things

52
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:15,509
choose right so we got a couple things
 

53
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,520
choose right so we got a couple things
to figure out yet I believe what we'll

54
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,530
to figure out yet I believe what we'll
 

55
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,910
to figure out yet I believe what we'll
end up doing here all these droppers are

56
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920
end up doing here all these droppers are
 

57
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,810
end up doing here all these droppers are
facing like the middle here right so

58
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:26,820
facing like the middle here right so
 

59
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,179
facing like the middle here right so
we'll probably want to funnel them into

60
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:29,189
we'll probably want to funnel them into
 

61
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,749
we'll probably want to funnel them into
the middle and hopefully I got some

62
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
the middle and hopefully I got some
 

63
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,170
the middle and hopefully I got some
packed ice here I'm hoping the initial

64
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,180
packed ice here I'm hoping the initial
 

65
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,130
packed ice here I'm hoping the initial
inertia initial inertia from the

66
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,140
inertia initial inertia from the
 

67
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,140
inertia initial inertia from the
droppers shooting them out is enough to

68
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,150
droppers shooting them out is enough to
 

69
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,330
droppers shooting them out is enough to
carry them oh it's not ooh

70
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,340
carry them oh it's not ooh
 

71
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,999
carry them oh it's not ooh
well you know when you know what it's an

72
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:50,009
well you know when you know what it's an
 

73
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,760
well you know when you know what it's an
even number this way I don't like that

74
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:51,770
even number this way I don't like that
 

75
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,139
even number this way I don't like that
it's got to be an odd number things need

76
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,149
it's got to be an odd number things need
 

77
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,969
it's got to be an odd number things need
to be symmetrical I just will do it this

78
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:55,979
to be symmetrical I just will do it this
 

79
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,179
to be symmetrical I just will do it this
way then all right and we'll make this

80
00:01:59,179 --> 00:01:59,189
way then all right and we'll make this
 

81
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,850
way then all right and we'll make this
the middle this is one seven wide we're

82
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:01,860
the middle this is one seven wide we're
 

83
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,230
the middle this is one seven wide we're
gonna try actually let's do it this way

84
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
gonna try actually let's do it this way
 

85
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,859
gonna try actually let's do it this way
let's keep a open line over here I'm

86
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:09,869
let's keep a open line over here I'm
 

87
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,690
let's keep a open line over here I'm
trying to avoid putting water right at

88
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:11,700
trying to avoid putting water right at
 

89
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,730
trying to avoid putting water right at
the top here like to push them

90
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:13,740
the top here like to push them
 

91
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,530
the top here like to push them
where they need to go because then you

92
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:15,540
where they need to go because then you
 

93
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,440
where they need to go because then you
got that water noise all the time right

94
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,450
got that water noise all the time right
 

95
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,670
got that water noise all the time right
although well hopefully we can get that

96
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
although well hopefully we can get that
 

97
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,990
although well hopefully we can get that
water noise a little bit farther away

98
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
water noise a little bit farther away
 

99
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,710
water noise a little bit farther away
anyway

100
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
anyway
 

101
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,290
anyway
so let's just make sure we're going to

102
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:27,300
so let's just make sure we're going to
 

103
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,100
so let's just make sure we're going to
put some stuff in there and we'll grab a

104
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,110
put some stuff in there and we'll grab a
 

105
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,960
put some stuff in there and we'll grab a
lever and just make sure it makes it all

106
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:32,970
lever and just make sure it makes it all
 

107
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,950
lever and just make sure it makes it all
the way to the edge there it should oh

108
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:35,960
the way to the edge there it should oh
 

109
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,350
the way to the edge there it should oh
you know I I just thought of something

110
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
you know I I just thought of something
 

111
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
you know I I just thought of something
this isn't going to work alright so that

112
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,010
this isn't going to work alright so that
 

113
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,440
this isn't going to work alright so that
does that okay

114
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,450

 

115
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,090

as far as I can tell it will always work

116
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,100
as far as I can tell it will always work
 

117
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,790
as far as I can tell it will always work
right but one thing I just realized if

118
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
right but one thing I just realized if
 

119
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,910
right but one thing I just realized if
we have it here in the middle there's a

120
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
we have it here in the middle there's a
 

121
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,930
we have it here in the middle there's a
chance that we'll probably go to the

122
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:56,940
chance that we'll probably go to the
 

123
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,470
chance that we'll probably go to the
left right let's just try this yeah darn

124
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
left right let's just try this yeah darn
 

125
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,240
left right let's just try this yeah darn
it okay so we do need to put water up

126
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,250
it okay so we do need to put water up
 

127
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,030
it okay so we do need to put water up
here all right

128
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,040
here all right
 

129
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,880
here all right
I'll get that going the other thing

130
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:10,890
I'll get that going the other thing
 

131
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll get that going the other thing
though we got to figure out how we're

132
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,090
though we got to figure out how we're
 

133
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,080
though we got to figure out how we're
going to place the chess we want as much

134
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,090
going to place the chess we want as much
 

135
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,600
going to place the chess we want as much
storage as possible in a little space as

136
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,610
storage as possible in a little space as
 

137
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,810
storage as possible in a little space as
possible right and we kind of need them

138
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:20,820
possible right and we kind of need them
 

139
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,670
possible right and we kind of need them
all connected together so we'll put a

140
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
all connected together so we'll put a
 

141
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,740
all connected together so we'll put a
hopper down here and see so each of

142
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:30,750
hopper down here and see so each of
 

143
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,840
hopper down here and see so each of
these lines is going to hold the

144
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:32,850
these lines is going to hold the
 

145
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,310
these lines is going to hold the
enchanted books through one type of

146
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,320
enchanted books through one type of
 

147
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,340
enchanted books through one type of
enchantment like protection or blast

148
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,350
enchantment like protection or blast
 

149
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,620
enchantment like protection or blast
protection would be another one and so

150
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:39,630
protection would be another one and so
 

151
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,040
protection would be another one and so
on and so forth two double chests is

152
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,050
on and so forth two double chests is
 

153
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,600
on and so forth two double chests is
quite a bit of space might go for three

154
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:47,610
quite a bit of space might go for three
 

155
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,260
quite a bit of space might go for three
three chests for each type yeah let's go

156
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,270
three chests for each type yeah let's go
 

157
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,770
three chests for each type yeah let's go
for three should I make it mmm which I

158
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:57,780
for three should I make it mmm which I
 

159
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,410
for three should I make it mmm which I
move it forward so you got this problem

160
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,420
move it forward so you got this problem
 

161
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,570
move it forward so you got this problem
now are the ones in the corner don't

162
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
now are the ones in the corner don't
 

163
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,670
now are the ones in the corner don't
have as much space but I guess there are

164
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,680
have as much space but I guess there are
 

165
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,410
have as much space but I guess there are
some enchantments in the game that

166
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,420
some enchantments in the game that
 

167
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,090
some enchantments in the game that
aren't as common as others so maybe

168
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,100
aren't as common as others so maybe
 

169
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,410
aren't as common as others so maybe
we'll put those in the corner aha yes

170
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,420
we'll put those in the corner aha yes
 

171
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,510
we'll put those in the corner aha yes
there we go guys I got it put together

172
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:14,520
there we go guys I got it put together
 

173
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,750
there we go guys I got it put together
here and I'm pretty happy with how how

174
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
here and I'm pretty happy with how how
 

175
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,770
here and I'm pretty happy with how how
it turned out

176
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:18,780
it turned out
 

177
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,920
it turned out
so the challenge with it I wanted to be

178
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,930
so the challenge with it I wanted to be
 

179
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,920
so the challenge with it I wanted to be
able to access the droppers right that

180
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:24,930
able to access the droppers right that
 

181
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,930
able to access the droppers right that
way we can manually take books out if we

182
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:26,940
way we can manually take books out if we
 

183
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,540
way we can manually take books out if we
want

184
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,550
want
 

185
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,279
want
we have to have some way of putting them

186
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,289
we have to have some way of putting them
 

187
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,140
we have to have some way of putting them
in and we got to be able to put them in

188
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,150
in and we got to be able to put them in
 

189
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,950
in and we got to be able to put them in
the very first chest in array here so

190
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
the very first chest in array here so
 

191
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,200
the very first chest in array here so
yeah we can still reach the first chest

192
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,210
yeah we can still reach the first chest
 

193
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,089
yeah we can still reach the first chest
in it it funnels its way down to the

194
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:39,099
in it it funnels its way down to the
 

195
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,600
in it it funnels its way down to the
dropper right so that's good and then I

196
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,610
dropper right so that's good and then I
 

197
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,969
dropper right so that's good and then I
also wanted it to be to have that

198
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:44,979
also wanted it to be to have that
 

199
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,490
also wanted it to be to have that
automatic retrieval system so we have to

200
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,500
automatic retrieval system so we have to
 

201
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,650
automatic retrieval system so we have to
be able to shoot it somewhere we can

202
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:49,660
be able to shoot it somewhere we can
 

203
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,379
be able to shoot it somewhere we can
collect it right and then we also need

204
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:52,389
collect it right and then we also need
 

205
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,089
collect it right and then we also need
to run redstone to it so there's uh

206
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:54,099
to run redstone to it so there's uh
 

207
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,070
to run redstone to it so there's uh
there's actually quite a bit to this and

208
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
there's actually quite a bit to this and
 

209
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,879
there's actually quite a bit to this and
I I'm happy we got it figured out and

210
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:58,889
I I'm happy we got it figured out and
 

211
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,649
I I'm happy we got it figured out and
take as little space as possible so we

212
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:01,659
take as little space as possible so we
 

213
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:04,290
take as little space as possible so we
got everything side by side very good

214
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,300
got everything side by side very good
 

215
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,010
got everything side by side very good
and this is like the colossal mess of

216
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,020
and this is like the colossal mess of
 

217
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,770
and this is like the colossal mess of
chess it was a puzzle to get them in

218
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:10,780
chess it was a puzzle to get them in
 

219
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,029
chess it was a puzzle to get them in
here because you can't put chests next

220
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
here because you can't put chests next
 

221
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,740
here because you can't put chests next
to Chester you get an alternate trap

222
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:16,750
to Chester you get an alternate trap
 

223
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,170
to Chester you get an alternate trap
chest with chess and then you get a real

224
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,180
chest with chess and then you get a real
 

225
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,749
chest with chess and then you get a real
problem in the corners so there's a

226
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
problem in the corners so there's a
 

227
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,909
problem in the corners so there's a
there's one spot where I had to use a

228
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
there's one spot where I had to use a
 

229
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,960
there's one spot where I had to use a
hopper instead of a chest but otherwise

230
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:26,970
hopper instead of a chest but otherwise
 

231
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,460
hopper instead of a chest but otherwise
we have three double chests for each

232
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,470
we have three double chests for each
 

233
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,439
we have three double chests for each
type of enchantment which is awesome

234
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:31,449
type of enchantment which is awesome
 

235
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,980
type of enchantment which is awesome
that's plenty of storage space and now

236
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:34,990
that's plenty of storage space and now
 

237
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,790
that's plenty of storage space and now
we are going to move on to the item

238
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:41,800
we are going to move on to the item
 

239
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,620
we are going to move on to the item
elevator and stuff to move the books to

240
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:43,630
elevator and stuff to move the books to
 

241
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,089
elevator and stuff to move the books to
us so the goal is to get the book

242
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,099
us so the goal is to get the book
 

243
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,360
us so the goal is to get the book
somewhere over here like around here

244
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,370
somewhere over here like around here
 

245
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,980
somewhere over here like around here
maybe even a little bit forward would be

246
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:49,990
maybe even a little bit forward would be
 

247
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,719
maybe even a little bit forward would be
fine because this is where we're going

248
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:51,729
fine because this is where we're going
 

249
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,360
fine because this is where we're going
to do the enchanting and these are the

250
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,370
to do the enchanting and these are the
 

251
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,950
to do the enchanting and these are the
buttons to call the books right so can't

252
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
buttons to call the books right so can't
 

253
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,620
buttons to call the books right so can't
just like run the the books underneath

254
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:01,630
just like run the the books underneath
 

255
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,350
just like run the the books underneath
this way because we have all the wiring

256
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
this way because we have all the wiring
 

257
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,260
this way because we have all the wiring
and over there right so I figured

258
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,270
and over there right so I figured
 

259
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,760
and over there right so I figured
something out and I'm pretty happy with

260
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:11,770
something out and I'm pretty happy with
 

261
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,680
something out and I'm pretty happy with
this here let's try this out too just to

262
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:13,690
this here let's try this out too just to
 

263
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,839
this here let's try this out too just to
show you that no matter where I throw it

264
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:15,849
show you that no matter where I throw it
 

265
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,149
show you that no matter where I throw it
or where the items get shot they seem to

266
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:18,159
or where the items get shot they seem to
 

267
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,629
or where the items get shot they seem to
all go in the hole there it's great and

268
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
all go in the hole there it's great and
 

269
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
all go in the hole there it's great and
you can see they then run that way

270
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,610
you can see they then run that way
 

271
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,390
you can see they then run that way
fairly quickly they get taken over here

272
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,400
fairly quickly they get taken over here
 

273
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,860
fairly quickly they get taken over here
opposite direction of where we want to

274
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:31,870
opposite direction of where we want to
 

275
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,230
opposite direction of where we want to
go unfortunately but look at this I used

276
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
go unfortunately but look at this I used
 

277
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,329
go unfortunately but look at this I used
Pat dice for for the redstone here so

278
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:39,339
Pat dice for for the redstone here so
 

279
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,430
Pat dice for for the redstone here so
that's awesome it's able to pass through

280
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
that's awesome it's able to pass through
 

281
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,470
that's awesome it's able to pass through
to the redstone that way because we're

282
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:43,480
to the redstone that way because we're
 

283
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,010
to the redstone that way because we're
surrounded entirely by redstone this

284
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,020
surrounded entirely by redstone this
 

285
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,960
surrounded entirely by redstone this
whole thing that's the way I was able to

286
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:48,970
whole thing that's the way I was able to
 

287
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,020
whole thing that's the way I was able to
get it through it now we got to get to

288
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,030
get it through it now we got to get to
 

289
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,340
get it through it now we got to get to
item elevator and we need to align the

290
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,350
item elevator and we need to align the
 

291
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,740
item elevator and we need to align the
items against the wall otherwise we're

292
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,750
items against the wall otherwise we're
 

293
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,030
items against the wall otherwise we're
going to have trouble so had an idea

294
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,040
going to have trouble so had an idea
 

295
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,410
going to have trouble so had an idea
let's do it like this see we'll have the

296
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:07,420
let's do it like this see we'll have the
 

297
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,030
let's do it like this see we'll have the
water stream in the corner so it pushes

298
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,040
water stream in the corner so it pushes
 

299
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,150
water stream in the corner so it pushes
them against the wall here and probably

300
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
them against the wall here and probably
 

301
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,020
them against the wall here and probably
a couple blocks forward let's see we

302
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,030
a couple blocks forward let's see we
 

303
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,940
a couple blocks forward let's see we
want to a decent mount a space here too

304
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:17,950
want to a decent mount a space here too
 

305
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,340
want to a decent mount a space here too
so we we can walk move it a little bit

306
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,350
so we we can walk move it a little bit
 

307
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,420
so we we can walk move it a little bit
more Oh I managed to do this without

308
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,430
more Oh I managed to do this without
 

309
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,280
more Oh I managed to do this without
spilling water all over the Redstone to

310
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,290
spilling water all over the Redstone to
 

311
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,790
spilling water all over the Redstone to
which I'm very happy about yeah I think

312
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:35,800
which I'm very happy about yeah I think
 

313
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,580
which I'm very happy about yeah I think
we have pretty much enough space now one

314
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,590
we have pretty much enough space now one
 

315
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,620
we have pretty much enough space now one
thing I'm not so happy about with this

316
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,630
thing I'm not so happy about with this
 

317
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,570
thing I'm not so happy about with this
is it blocks our view of the library

318
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:42,580
is it blocks our view of the library
 

319
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,170
is it blocks our view of the library
right it's sort of a giant wall in the

320
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,180
right it's sort of a giant wall in the
 

321
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,760
right it's sort of a giant wall in the
way but I think it's fine like this area

322
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:47,770
way but I think it's fine like this area
 

323
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,820
way but I think it's fine like this area
is pretty open as it is it's almost nice

324
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:50,830
is pretty open as it is it's almost nice
 

325
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,880
is pretty open as it is it's almost nice
to have have a wall here umm because

326
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:53,890
to have have a wall here umm because
 

327
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,530
to have have a wall here umm because
otherwise you can see the whole building

328
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:55,540
otherwise you can see the whole building
 

329
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,970
otherwise you can see the whole building
in one room you know so having a little

330
00:07:59,970 --> 00:07:59,980
in one room you know so having a little
 

331
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,909
in one room you know so having a little
bit of having the view blocked a little

332
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:02,919
bit of having the view blocked a little
 

333
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,320
bit of having the view blocked a little
bit isn't the worst thing in the world I

334
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,330
bit isn't the worst thing in the world I
 

335
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,030
bit isn't the worst thing in the world I
guess alright so basically what I'm

336
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,040
guess alright so basically what I'm
 

337
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,920
guess alright so basically what I'm
going to do is probably put an item

338
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:10,930
going to do is probably put an item
 

339
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:22,110
going to do is probably put an item
elevator around here do it like this

340
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,120

 

341
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,700

actually on second thought this is a

342
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,710
actually on second thought this is a
 

343
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,430
actually on second thought this is a
terrible idea I was going to go up and

344
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
terrible idea I was going to go up and
 

345
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,320
terrible idea I was going to go up and
then carry the books across the ceiling

346
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,330
then carry the books across the ceiling
 

347
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,820
then carry the books across the ceiling
of the library and then drop them down

348
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:30,830
of the library and then drop them down
 

349
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,740
of the library and then drop them down
on me why do that when we can go down

350
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,750
on me why do that when we can go down
 

351
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,740
on me why do that when we can go down
here go underneath the red stone the red

352
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,750
here go underneath the red stone the red
 

353
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,050
here go underneath the red stone the red
stone goes down like like two or three

354
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,060
stone goes down like like two or three
 

355
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,670
stone goes down like like two or three
more blocks here so we can easily go

356
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:42,680
more blocks here so we can easily go
 

357
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,910
more blocks here so we can easily go
underneath it and then make the items

358
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
underneath it and then make the items
 

359
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,820
underneath it and then make the items
come up or the books come up over here

360
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:48,830
come up or the books come up over here
 

361
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,310
come up or the books come up over here
with an item elevator uh-huh

362
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
with an item elevator uh-huh
 

363
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,740
with an item elevator uh-huh
then it's all hidden underground and we

364
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:53,750
then it's all hidden underground and we
 

365
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,960
then it's all hidden underground and we
don't need this extra junk over here and

366
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:55,970
don't need this extra junk over here and
 

367
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,470
don't need this extra junk over here and
in the ceiling now I didn't expect that

368
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,480
in the ceiling now I didn't expect that
 

369
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,240
in the ceiling now I didn't expect that
I actually got an item stuck in there I

370
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,250
I actually got an item stuck in there I
 

371
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,740
I actually got an item stuck in there I
was thrown a bunch of junk in here and

372
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,750
was thrown a bunch of junk in here and
 

373
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,530
was thrown a bunch of junk in here and
the sign got stuck on the very edge of

374
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:05,540
the sign got stuck on the very edge of
 

375
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,630
the sign got stuck on the very edge of
that ice block because I guess the water

376
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:07,640
that ice block because I guess the water
 

377
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,590
that ice block because I guess the water
is going on the right that one's going

378
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:08,600
is going on the right that one's going
 

379
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,140
is going on the right that one's going
to left that's the middle right there

380
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,150
to left that's the middle right there
 

381
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,090
to left that's the middle right there
and it can get stuck apparently so I'll

382
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,100
and it can get stuck apparently so I'll
 

383
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,620
and it can get stuck apparently so I'll
have to take out one more ice block over

384
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,630
have to take out one more ice block over
 

385
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,380
have to take out one more ice block over
there oh yeah it happened again uh-huh

386
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,390
there oh yeah it happened again uh-huh
 

387
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,700
there oh yeah it happened again uh-huh
but it does seem to be working

388
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:20,710
but it does seem to be working
 

389
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,430
but it does seem to be working
got the item elevator in so just the

390
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:24,440
got the item elevator in so just the
 

391
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,350
got the item elevator in so just the
moment you see the repeater pop up over

392
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,360
moment you see the repeater pop up over
 

393
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,580
moment you see the repeater pop up over
there any moment there we go

394
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:30,590
there any moment there we go
 

395
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,390
there any moment there we go
pretty cool pretty cool and I like it

396
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,400
pretty cool pretty cool and I like it
 

397
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,510
pretty cool pretty cool and I like it
let's go underneath just to show you

398
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:36,520
let's go underneath just to show you
 

399
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,040
let's go underneath just to show you
yeah so I got it pushing against the

400
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,050
yeah so I got it pushing against the
 

401
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,000
yeah so I got it pushing against the
wall again so it gets aligned properly

402
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,010
wall again so it gets aligned properly
 

403
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,400
wall again so it gets aligned properly
that's actually pretty big oh I might

404
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,410
that's actually pretty big oh I might
 

405
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,820
that's actually pretty big oh I might
want to put another water stream there

406
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:47,830
want to put another water stream there
 

407
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,110
want to put another water stream there
goes up to the item elevator here and

408
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,120
goes up to the item elevator here and
 

409
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,410
goes up to the item elevator here and
then up so it's pretty good now another

410
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,420
then up so it's pretty good now another
 

411
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,760
then up so it's pretty good now another
thing I'm going to have to do is put

412
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:54,770
thing I'm going to have to do is put
 

413
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,320
thing I'm going to have to do is put
down a bunch of signs and label all

414
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,330
down a bunch of signs and label all
 

415
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,040
down a bunch of signs and label all
these chests I wasn't able to decide

416
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,050
these chests I wasn't able to decide
 

417
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,780
these chests I wasn't able to decide
which I liked more either this way like

418
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:01,790
which I liked more either this way like
 

419
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,270
which I liked more either this way like
put some bookcases in front you can

420
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,280
put some bookcases in front you can
 

421
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,110
put some bookcases in front you can
still access the droppers like that it's

422
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,120
still access the droppers like that it's
 

423
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,580
still access the droppers like that it's
a little bit more tricky but it does

424
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,590
a little bit more tricky but it does
 

425
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,400
a little bit more tricky but it does
block the water and stuff makes it maybe

426
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,410
block the water and stuff makes it maybe
 

427
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,430
block the water and stuff makes it maybe
a little bit nicer because otherwise you

428
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
a little bit nicer because otherwise you
 

429
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,800
a little bit nicer because otherwise you
can see through the hoppers here so I

430
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:17,810
can see through the hoppers here so I
 

431
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,540
can see through the hoppers here so I
think up up but Jace's in front and then

432
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,550
think up up but Jace's in front and then
 

433
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,250
think up up but Jace's in front and then
I'll probably put signs on those like

434
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,260
I'll probably put signs on those like
 

435
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,760
I'll probably put signs on those like
that perhaps that labels what's in the

436
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:27,770
that perhaps that labels what's in the
 

437
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,910
that perhaps that labels what's in the
chest and then over here I got a workout

438
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:30,920
chest and then over here I got a workout
 

439
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,890
chest and then over here I got a workout
workout this button area too I'll

440
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:32,900
workout this button area too I'll
 

441
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,879
workout this button area too I'll
probably put it like this

442
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:35,889
probably put it like this
 

443
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,660
probably put it like this
maybe put bookcases down oops

444
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:40,670
maybe put bookcases down oops
 

445
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,289
maybe put bookcases down oops
I don't have still touch I really need

446

00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,100
maybe bookcases there then like wood
more bookcases on the top put the

452
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,110
more bookcases on the top put the
 

453
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,660
more bookcases on the top put the
buttons on the bookcases and then the

454
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:55,670
buttons on the bookcases and then the
 

455
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,389
buttons on the bookcases and then the
signs in between labeling what the

456
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
signs in between labeling what the
 

457
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,359
signs in between labeling what the
buttons call I think that would be cool

458
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:01,369
buttons call I think that would be cool
 

459
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,210
buttons call I think that would be cool
and I'm going to put a a tune that plays

460

and I'm going to put a a tune that plays
 

461
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,319
and I'm going to put a a tune that plays
to whenever we request a book so let me

462
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:08,329
to whenever we request a book so let me
 

463
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,239
to whenever we request a book so let me
get to that and we will check out the

464

get to that and we will check out the
 

465
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,639
get to that and we will check out the
finish system here

466
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:11,649
finish system here
 

467
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,600
finish system here
aha yes yes it is done guys I got a

468
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,610
aha yes yes it is done guys I got a
 

469

aha yes yes it is done guys I got a
complete here haven't tested it though

470
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:18,639
complete here haven't tested it though
 

471
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,789
complete here haven't tested it though
but if this works the way I wanted to

maybe some extra straw for feeding them
 

817
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:38,240
maybe some extra straw for feeding them

actually I kind of wanted to go this way
 

823
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,120
actually I kind of wanted to go this way
how's that that way one goes down one

824
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,130
how's that that way one goes down one
 

825
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,190
how's that that way one goes down one
goes right one goes this way so they're

826
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,200
goes right one goes this way so they're
 

827
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,120
goes right one goes this way so they're
all different yeah yeah I like that

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:53,550
okay and I saw something on the reddit a
 

831
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,760
okay and I saw something on the reddit a
little while ago somebody made a barrel

832
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:55,770
little while ago somebody made a barrel
 

833
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,270
little while ago somebody made a barrel
I think they use spruce stores for it so

834
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
I think they use spruce stores for it so
 

835
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,560
I think they use spruce stores for it so
I want to try maybe put one of those

836
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,570
I want to try maybe put one of those
 

837
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,210
I want to try maybe put one of those
here

838
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,220
here
 

839
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,360
here
it's like spruce doors around two blocks

840
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,370
it's like spruce doors around two blocks
 

841
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,460
it's like spruce doors around two blocks
like that and then put a slab on the top

842
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,470
like that and then put a slab on the top
 

843
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,800
like that and then put a slab on the top
it's pretty tall barrel though that look

844
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:12,810
it's pretty tall barrel though that look
 

845
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,440
it's pretty tall barrel though that look
weird I don't know we'll try it out for

846
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,450
weird I don't know we'll try it out for
 

847
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,040
weird I don't know we'll try it out for
a while anyway

848
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,050
a while anyway
 

849
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,590
a while anyway
and maybe one last thing we'll do today

850
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:18,600
and maybe one last thing we'll do today
 

851
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,680
and maybe one last thing we'll do today
or try to do is set up the well so I

852
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:21,690
or try to do is set up the well so I
 

853
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,890
or try to do is set up the well so I
brought a cauldron with me and I was

854
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:24,900
brought a cauldron with me and I was
 

855
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,269
brought a cauldron with me and I was
thinking over here would be a cool

856
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:26,279
thinking over here would be a cool
 

857
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,639
thinking over here would be a cool
maybe let's dig a three-by-three a lot

858
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:31,649
maybe let's dig a three-by-three a lot
 

859
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,129
maybe let's dig a three-by-three a lot
of times when people make wells in this

860
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:34,139
of times when people make wells in this
 

861
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:35,899
of times when people make wells in this
game they always put the water right at

862
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:35,909
game they always put the water right at
 

863
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,039
game they always put the water right at
the top of the well which I never

864
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,049
the top of the well which I never
 

865
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,489
the top of the well which I never
understood like the point of a well is

866
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:40,499
understood like the point of a well is
 

867
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,070
understood like the point of a well is
to get water from underground right so

868
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,080
to get water from underground right so
 

869
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,479
to get water from underground right so
the water should be deep down in the

870
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:44,489
the water should be deep down in the
 

871
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:45,349
the water should be deep down in the
well should innit

872
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:45,359
well should innit
 

873
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,489
well should innit
like sometimes sure it fills up but I

874
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:48,499
like sometimes sure it fills up but I
 

875
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:50,419
like sometimes sure it fills up but I
don't know I think I'm going to dig the

876
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:50,429
don't know I think I'm going to dig the
 

877
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:51,859
don't know I think I'm going to dig the
well pretty deep and then put water at

878
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:51,869
well pretty deep and then put water at
 

879
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,690
well pretty deep and then put water at
the bottom and then might have a

880
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:53,700
the bottom and then might have a
 

881
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,619
the bottom and then might have a
cauldron with water and at the top and

882
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:56,629
cauldron with water and at the top and
 

883
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,719
cauldron with water and at the top and
we'll connect some defenses to it does

884
00:21:59,719 --> 00:21:59,729
we'll connect some defenses to it does
 

885
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:04,099
we'll connect some defenses to it does
that work maybe one more and then like

886
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:04,109
that work maybe one more and then like
 

887
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,440
that work maybe one more and then like
connect it to a support beam of some

888
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,450
connect it to a support beam of some
 

889
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,700
connect it to a support beam of some
sort does it connect to the side no it

890
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:10,710
sort does it connect to the side no it
 

891
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,700
sort does it connect to the side no it
doesn't okay it would look better if I

892
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:13,710
doesn't okay it would look better if I
 

893
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,219
doesn't okay it would look better if I
think if we had like connected to the

894
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:16,229
think if we had like connected to the
 

895
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:18,769
think if we had like connected to the
side there and there but since it

896
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:18,779
side there and there but since it
 

897
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,389
side there and there but since it
doesn't alright we'll do it that way and

898
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:22,399
doesn't alright we'll do it that way and
 

899
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:26,769
doesn't alright we'll do it that way and
then throw up a beam maybe over here

900
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:26,779
then throw up a beam maybe over here
 

901
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:32,599
then throw up a beam maybe over here
actually let's take this out and I'll

902
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:32,609
actually let's take this out and I'll
 

903
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,609
actually let's take this out and I'll
probably throw some sandstone around

904
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:34,619
probably throw some sandstone around
 

905
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,019
probably throw some sandstone around
here or some stone as well okay so this

906
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:39,029
here or some stone as well okay so this
 

907
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,789
here or some stone as well okay so this
is the well I came up with I don't know

908
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
is the well I came up with I don't know
 

909
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,950
is the well I came up with I don't know
if it's good or not but we'll grow with

910
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
if it's good or not but we'll grow with
 

911
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,379
if it's good or not but we'll grow with
it I guess and I made it go from

912
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:45,389
it I guess and I made it go from
 

913
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:48,229
it I guess and I made it go from
sandstone to sand and then to gravel at

914
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:48,239
sandstone to sand and then to gravel at
 

915
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,759
sandstone to sand and then to gravel at
the very bottom where the water is so it

916
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:49,769
the very bottom where the water is so it
 

917
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,919
the very bottom where the water is so it
becomes the ground becomes more porous

918
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:51,929
becomes the ground becomes more porous
 

919
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,639
becomes the ground becomes more porous
as it gets to the water if that makes

920
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:55,649
as it gets to the water if that makes
 

921
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,419
as it gets to the water if that makes
sense put water in the culture in and

922
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:58,429
sense put water in the culture in and
 

923
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,339
sense put water in the culture in and
yeah are you ready for this detail this

924
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:01,349
yeah are you ready for this detail this
 

925
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,700
yeah are you ready for this detail this
is gonna blow your mind you ready for it

926
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,710
is gonna blow your mind you ready for it
 

927
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,440
is gonna blow your mind you ready for it
there's actually water in the barrel now

928
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,450
there's actually water in the barrel now
 

929
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,959
there's actually water in the barrel now

we go this is the comments I picked out

934
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:14,009
we go this is the comments I picked out
 

935
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,119
we go this is the comments I picked out
for today's episode it says hey etho you

00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:18,599
should totally do something about the
 

939
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,719
should totally do something about the
lava creeper entrance like something

940
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:20,729
lava creeper entrance like something
 

941
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,479
lava creeper entrance like something
with position like something that

942
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:23,489
with position like something that
 

943
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,349
with position like something that
positions that like something I know

944
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:27,359
positions that like something I know

what it says I don't know if it makes
 

947
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,680
what it says I don't know if it makes
sense like something with positions that

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,690
sense like something with positions that
 

949
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,269

block the lab trying to I'm trying to

950
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:35,279
block the lab trying to I'm trying to
 

951
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,769
block the lab trying to I'm trying to
translate what it actually is supposed

952
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:36,779
translate what it actually is supposed
 

953

to say like something
 

955
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
to say like something
would position the block the lavis
