and this is a 10 by 10 by 10 cube of ice
 

627
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,310
and this is a 10 by 10 by 10 cube of ice
thousand blocks oh man how should we do

628
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
thousand blocks oh man how should we do
 

629
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,430
thousand blocks oh man how should we do
this

630
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
this
 

631
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,470
this
this is going to be so satisfying shall

632
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480

we
 

635
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,030
we
i guess the logical way is go from like

636
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
i guess the logical way is go from like
 

637
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,310
i guess the logical way is go from like
the top down

638
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
the top down
 

639
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,910

actually 11 layers because

666
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
actually 11 layers because
 

667
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,710
actually 11 layers because
there was one layer it wasn't able to

668
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
there was one layer it wasn't able to
 

669
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,629
there was one layer it wasn't able to
push up and now it's it's able to do it

670
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639

 

671

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
okay i got it all this is what it looks
 

679
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,189
okay i got it all this is what it looks
like in in the chest

680
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
like in in the chest
 

681
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,829
like in in the chest
compared to like what we just saw just

682
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
compared to like what we just saw just
 

683
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,110
compared to like what we just saw just
two rows

684
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
two rows
 

685
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,509
two rows
but that is over 1200 blocks of ice

686
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
but that is over 1200 blocks of ice
 

687
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,230
but that is over 1200 blocks of ice
right there which is pretty cool

688
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
right there which is pretty cool
 

689
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:28,829
right there which is pretty cool
literally

690
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

691
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,350

hmm

692
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
hmm
 

693
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,829
hmm
okay guys so now that we have all this

694
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
okay guys so now that we have all this
 

695
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,590
okay guys so now that we have all this
ice from that ice farm i was trying to

696
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
ice from that ice farm i was trying to
 

697
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,629
ice from that ice farm i was trying to
think like

698
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
think like
 

699
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,389
think like
is there anything i actually want to use

700
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
is there anything i actually want to use
 

701
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,910
is there anything i actually want to use
that for

702
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
that for
 

703
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,949
that for
or is it just like an overkill farm have

704
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
or is it just like an overkill farm have
 

705
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,069
or is it just like an overkill farm have
all the like thousands

706
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
all the like thousands
 

707
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,750
all the like thousands
of blocks of ice and i'm never gonna use

708
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
of blocks of ice and i'm never gonna use
 

709
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,069
of blocks of ice and i'm never gonna use
it uh but there's actually a project

710
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
it uh but there's actually a project
 

711
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,750
it uh but there's actually a project
i think we should do today

712
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760

 

713
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,790

chomp chomp jump uh we're gonna head

714
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
chomp chomp jump uh we're gonna head
 

715
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,389
chomp chomp jump uh we're gonna head
over to the end here it's been a while

716
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
over to the end here it's been a while
 

717
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,230
over to the end here it's been a while
since we did a project in the end like

718
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
since we did a project in the end like
 

719
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,550
since we did a project in the end like
i think the enderman farm was the last

720
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
i think the enderman farm was the last
 

721
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,270
i think the enderman farm was the last
one actually

722
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,280

 

723
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,670

[Music]

724
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
[Music]
 

725
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,030
[Music]
because the end is scary

726
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
because the end is scary
 

727
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,949
because the end is scary
not the enderman i don't care about the

728
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
not the enderman i don't care about the
 

729
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,389
not the enderman i don't care about the
enderman it's that void

730
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
enderman it's that void
 

731
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,910
enderman it's that void
the stinking void just terrifies me

732
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
the stinking void just terrifies me
 

733
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,110
the stinking void just terrifies me
because i've lost so much stuff in it

734
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
because i've lost so much stuff in it
 

735
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,069
because i've lost so much stuff in it
uh but yeah we here maybe let's take a

736
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
uh but yeah we here maybe let's take a
 

737
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,430
uh but yeah we here maybe let's take a
look at this first

738
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
look at this first
 

739
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,710
look at this first
to introduce the idea so for our first

740
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
to introduce the idea so for our first
 

741
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,870
to introduce the idea so for our first
enderman farm over there we built this

742
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
enderman farm over there we built this
 

743
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,310
enderman farm over there we built this
rail line underneath the path and

744
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
rail line underneath the path and
 

745
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,590
rail line underneath the path and
the idea was like when i'm over there

746
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
the idea was like when i'm over there
 

747
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,430
the idea was like when i'm over there
dropped some ender pearls in a storage

748
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
dropped some ender pearls in a storage
 

749
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,949
dropped some ender pearls in a storage
minecart and then it will

750
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
minecart and then it will
 

751
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,509
minecart and then it will
take off and go over to here then we got

752
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
take off and go over to here then we got
 

753
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,710
take off and go over to here then we got
a bunch of

754
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
a bunch of
 

755
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,430
a bunch of
get out of here man got a bunch of

756
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
get out of here man got a bunch of
 

757
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,269
get out of here man got a bunch of
chests here and an unloading station all

758
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
chests here and an unloading station all
 

759
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,430
chests here and an unloading station all
the ender pearls would get unloaded

760
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
the ender pearls would get unloaded
 

761
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,230
the ender pearls would get unloaded
oh there's still something the mine cart

762
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
oh there's still something the mine cart
 

763
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,350
oh there's still something the mine cart
would return and i could

764
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
would return and i could
 

765
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,550
would return and i could
fill it up with some more and and yeah

766
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
fill it up with some more and and yeah
 

767
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,829
fill it up with some more and and yeah
it sounds good in theory in practice it

768
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
it sounds good in theory in practice it
 

769
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,749
it sounds good in theory in practice it
it worked okay it wasn't great though

770
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
it worked okay it wasn't great though
 

771
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,069
it worked okay it wasn't great though
the main issue

772
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
the main issue
 

773
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,829
the main issue
like i would be over there i'd drop off

774
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
like i would be over there i'd drop off
 

775
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,550
like i would be over there i'd drop off
a a whole inventory of ender pearls into

776
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
a a whole inventory of ender pearls into
 

777
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,590
a a whole inventory of ender pearls into
the storage minecart

778
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
the storage minecart
 

779
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,310
the storage minecart
send it back and then it would unload

780
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
send it back and then it would unload
 

781
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,829
send it back and then it would unload
over here right and it would never come

782
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
over here right and it would never come
 

783
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,509
over here right and it would never come
back so

784
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
back so
 

785
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,829
back so
couldn't really send a lot of ender

786
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
couldn't really send a lot of ender
 

787
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,710
couldn't really send a lot of ender
pearls

788
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
pearls
 

789
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,430
pearls
um when i was over there because the

790
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
um when i was over there because the
 

791
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,069
um when i was over there because the
storage minecart never came back right

792
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
storage minecart never came back right
 

793
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,189
storage minecart never came back right
so what we're gonna do

794
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
so what we're gonna do
 

795
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,670
so what we're gonna do
for the new farm we're gonna use water

796
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
for the new farm we're gonna use water
 

797
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,269
for the new farm we're gonna use water
streams instead

798
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
streams instead
 

799
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,949
streams instead
no mine carts is there a center to this

800
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959

 

801
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,990

i think that's it right yeah

802
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
i think that's it right yeah
 

803
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,910
i think that's it right yeah
we're gonna build an item elevator first

804
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
we're gonna build an item elevator first
 

805
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,990
we're gonna build an item elevator first
of all underneath our

806
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
of all underneath our
 

807
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,389
of all underneath our
our portal let's see

808
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
our portal let's see
 

809
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,629
our portal let's see
yeah i think that'll be okay so we gotta

810
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
yeah i think that'll be okay so we gotta
 

811
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,470
yeah i think that'll be okay so we gotta
dig straight down here

812
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480

 

813
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,829

actually no we don't even need to dig

814
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
actually no we don't even need to dig
 

815
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,150
actually no we don't even need to dig
through the ground do we

816
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
through the ground do we
 

817
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,829
through the ground do we
should i just send him through the end

818
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
should i just send him through the end
 

819
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,590
should i just send him through the end
stone i guess it's the same thing

820
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
stone i guess it's the same thing
 

821
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,949
stone i guess it's the same thing
yeah maybe we'll do that so basically

822
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
yeah maybe we'll do that so basically
 

823
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,669
yeah maybe we'll do that so basically
save some work for myself all you gotta

824
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
save some work for myself all you gotta
 

825
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,069
save some work for myself all you gotta
do

826
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079

 

827
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,309

do a plus sign thing all the way up to

828
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
do a plus sign thing all the way up to
 

829
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,630
do a plus sign thing all the way up to
the the end portal make sure there's no

830
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
the the end portal make sure there's no
 

831
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,189
the the end portal make sure there's no
air spaces

832
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
air spaces
 

833
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,029
air spaces
actually let me check the location of

834
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
actually let me check the location of
 

835
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,549
actually let me check the location of
this

836
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
this
 

837
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,990
this
just so i get it right hopefully there's

838
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
just so i get it right hopefully there's
 

839
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,350
just so i get it right hopefully there's
no like secret air pockets in between

840
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
no like secret air pockets in between
 

841
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,190
no like secret air pockets in between
uh this and the bottom of the island so

842
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
uh this and the bottom of the island so
 

843
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,070
uh this and the bottom of the island so
we're at 73

844
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
we're at 73
 

845
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,270
we're at 73
and negative nine

846
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
and negative nine
 

847
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,990
and negative nine
good okay i'm gonna fill that back up

848
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
good okay i'm gonna fill that back up
 

849
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,789
good okay i'm gonna fill that back up
we're gonna head down

850
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799

 

851
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,470

got a ladder here oh this is going to

852
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
got a ladder here oh this is going to
 

853
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,390
got a ladder here oh this is going to
take a while

854
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400

 

855
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,950

as you can see my end situation isn't

856
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
as you can see my end situation isn't
 

857
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,950
as you can see my end situation isn't
the nicest i have to like traverse these

858
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
the nicest i have to like traverse these
 

859
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,230
the nicest i have to like traverse these
one wide

860
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
one wide
 

861
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,870
one wide
dirt paths to get up this ladder and

862
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
dirt paths to get up this ladder and
 

863
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,430
dirt paths to get up this ladder and
yeah

864
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
yeah
 

865
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,350
yeah
so i want to do some adjustments on this

866
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
so i want to do some adjustments on this
 

867
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,789
so i want to do some adjustments on this
let's break this break this did i bring

868
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
let's break this break this did i bring
 

869
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,549
let's break this break this did i bring
any other blocks i wonder okay what was

870
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
any other blocks i wonder okay what was
 

871
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,590
any other blocks i wonder okay what was
the location again

872
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
the location again
 

873
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,190
the location again
73 negative nine so you gotta go a few

874
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
73 negative nine so you gotta go a few
 

875
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,990
73 negative nine so you gotta go a few
more blocks

876
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
more blocks
 

877
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,909
more blocks
this way i'm so scared to press any key

878
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
this way i'm so scared to press any key
 

879
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,549
this way i'm so scared to press any key
right now

880
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559

 

881
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,390

okay let's get f3 back up

882
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
okay let's get f3 back up
 

883
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,950
okay let's get f3 back up
is that it no one more block so this is

884
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
is that it no one more block so this is
 

885
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,029
is that it no one more block so this is
the center right here

886
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
the center right here
 

887
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,950
the center right here
uh so i'm going to do that plus sign a

888
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
uh so i'm going to do that plus sign a
 

889
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,190
uh so i'm going to do that plus sign a
glass all the way up

890
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
glass all the way up
 

891
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,270
glass all the way up
and then we need to build like a loading

892
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
and then we need to build like a loading
 

893
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,070
and then we need to build like a loading
thing for this

894
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
thing for this
 

895
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,830
thing for this
so we're going to build an item elevator

896
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
so we're going to build an item elevator
 

897
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,390
so we're going to build an item elevator
here that doesn't use any pistons

898
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
here that doesn't use any pistons
 

899
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,590
here that doesn't use any pistons
basically this is the center this fence

900
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
basically this is the center this fence
 

901
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,430
basically this is the center this fence
the back one and

902
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
the back one and
 

903
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,350
the back one and
need solid blocks next to that so it

904
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
need solid blocks next to that so it
 

905
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,710
need solid blocks next to that so it
does this plus sign

906
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
does this plus sign
 

907
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,430
does this plus sign
shape right then this front fence we

908
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
shape right then this front fence we
 

909
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,909
shape right then this front fence we
want

910
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
want
 

911
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,590
want
something it doesn't attach to on the

912
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
something it doesn't attach to on the
 

913
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,350
something it doesn't attach to on the
sides

914
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
sides
 

915
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,630
sides
like that and then above

916
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
like that and then above
 

917
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,070
like that and then above
the middle one you gotta do the plus

918
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
the middle one you gotta do the plus
 

919
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,190
the middle one you gotta do the plus
sign like that

920
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
sign like that
 

921
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,310
sign like that
right um then we got a

922
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
right um then we got a
 

923
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,950
right um then we got a
here let's add some ice

924
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960

 

925
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,350

and some more glass

926
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
and some more glass
 

927
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,549
and some more glass
all right i guess we'll probably have

928
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
all right i guess we'll probably have
 

929
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,350
all right i guess we'll probably have
glass all the way down here

930
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
glass all the way down here
 

931
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,789
glass all the way down here
i just want to test this make sure it

932
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
i just want to test this make sure it
 

933
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,710
i just want to test this make sure it
works first

934
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
works first
 

935
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,270
works first
so let's just throw down some some water

936
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
so let's just throw down some some water
 

937
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,310
so let's just throw down some some water
here

938
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
here
 

939
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,230
here
see if we can get it working so

940
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
see if we can get it working so
 

941
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,310
see if we can get it working so
we gotta align the items right next to

942
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
we gotta align the items right next to
 

943
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,470
we gotta align the items right next to
the wall as well i think

944
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
the wall as well i think
 

945
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,070
the wall as well i think
yeah there we go it worked right

946
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
yeah there we go it worked right
 

947
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,510
yeah there we go it worked right
yeah i think that was good here maybe

948
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
yeah i think that was good here maybe
 

949
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,190
yeah i think that was good here maybe
we'll build a little bit higher just to

950
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
we'll build a little bit higher just to
 

951
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,270
we'll build a little bit higher just to
be sure

952
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
be sure
 

953
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,789
be sure
i'm gonna have to go all the way up to

954
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
i'm gonna have to go all the way up to
 

955
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,950
i'm gonna have to go all the way up to
the bottom of the island with this glass

956
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960

 

957
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,710

and then it should send items through

958
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
and then it should send items through
 

959
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,990
and then it should send items through
the portal automatically

960
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
the portal automatically
 

961
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,630
the portal automatically
okay let's try it again

962
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640

 

963
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,710

seems like it's jumping out i might need

964
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
seems like it's jumping out i might need
 

965
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,110
seems like it's jumping out i might need
some more blocks here

966
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120

 

967
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,710

oh i do have a block there i thought i

968
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
oh i do have a block there i thought i
 

969
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,830
oh i do have a block there i thought i
didn't

970
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
didn't
 

971
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:27,909
didn't
hmm why you no work

972
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919

 

973
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,190

okay tell you what we're gonna do it

974
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
okay tell you what we're gonna do it
 

975
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,870
okay tell you what we're gonna do it
proper make sure we do it right

976
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
proper make sure we do it right
 

977
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,950
proper make sure we do it right
here let's grab this it kind of has to

978
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
here let's grab this it kind of has to
 

979
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,710
here let's grab this it kind of has to
go around a bend that way it aligns it

980
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
go around a bend that way it aligns it
 

981
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,390
go around a bend that way it aligns it
against the wall fisher

982
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400

 

983
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,789

yeah now it works okay so just throwing

984
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
yeah now it works okay so just throwing
 

985
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,830
yeah now it works okay so just throwing
it against the wall

986
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
it against the wall
 

987
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,350
it against the wall
was a little iffy i guess okay that's

988
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
was a little iffy i guess okay that's
 

989
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,710
was a little iffy i guess okay that's
cool

990
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
cool
 

991
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,909
cool
so basically we got to build an ice an

992
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
so basically we got to build an ice an
 

993
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,029
so basically we got to build an ice an
ice water stream

994
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
ice water stream
 

995
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,669
ice water stream
all the way from the enderman farm out

996
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
all the way from the enderman farm out
 

997
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,549
all the way from the enderman farm out
there

998
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
there
 

999
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,950
there
carry items all the way here when they

1000
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
carry items all the way here when they
 

1001
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,630
carry items all the way here when they
hit this fence though

1002
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
hit this fence though
 

1003
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,350
hit this fence though
or not that fence the that fence over

1004
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
or not that fence the that fence over
 

1005
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,149
or not that fence the that fence over
here

1006
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
here
 

1007
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,950
here
they will flow up and go through the

1008
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
they will flow up and go through the
 

1009
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,350
they will flow up and go through the
portal

1010
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360

 

1011
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,590

all right well this is a little bulkier

1012
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
all right well this is a little bulkier
 

1013
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,870
all right well this is a little bulkier

try to figure this out

1110
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280

 

1111
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,190

well you all know not to dig straight

well you all know not to dig straight
 

1113
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,270
well you all know not to dig straight
down but that is especially true in the

1114
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
down but that is especially true in the
 

1115
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,029
down but that is especially true in the
end

1116
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
end
 

1117
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,149
end
uh okay there is no hollow spots in

1118
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
uh okay there is no hollow spots in
 

1119
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,830
uh okay there is no hollow spots in
between

1120
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
between
 

1121
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,909
between
the bottom of the island and the top of

1122
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
the bottom of the island and the top of
 

1123
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,630
the bottom of the island and the top of
the island so that's not what happened

1124
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
the island so that's not what happened
 

1125
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,590
the island so that's not what happened
just wanted to double check i think what

1126
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
just wanted to double check i think what
 

1127
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,070
just wanted to double check i think what
we'll do

1128
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
we'll do
 

1129
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,190
we'll do
to test this again let's go back

1130
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
to test this again let's go back
 

1131
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,830
to test this again let's go back
up and rather than trying to send the

1132
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
up and rather than trying to send the
 

1133
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,510
up and rather than trying to send the
items through the portal let's just try

1134
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
items through the portal let's just try
 

1135
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,830
items through the portal let's just try
to send them to the top of this

1136
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
to send them to the top of this
 

1137
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,350
to send them to the top of this
and see if they can do that because i

1138
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
and see if they can do that because i
 

1139
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,070
and see if they can do that because i
don't know

1140
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080

 

1141
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,909

what is happening to them it looks like

1142
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
what is happening to them it looks like
 

1143
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,070
what is happening to them it looks like
they go up the elevator maybe they just

1144
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,080
they go up the elevator maybe they just
 

1145
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,830
they go up the elevator maybe they just
are not going through the portal

1146
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
are not going through the portal
 

1147
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,430
are not going through the portal
properly

1148
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
properly
 

1149
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,510
properly
maybe because i'm putting them in

1150
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
maybe because i'm putting them in
 

1151
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,350
maybe because i'm putting them in
putting them in from the bottom

1152
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
putting them in from the bottom
 

1153
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,230
putting them in from the bottom
instead of dropping them in i don't know

1154
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
instead of dropping them in i don't know
 

1155
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,470
instead of dropping them in i don't know
all right so hopefully the items end up

1156
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
all right so hopefully the items end up
 

1157
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,510
all right so hopefully the items end up
right there

1301
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,230

okay so here's how i did it now

1302
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
okay so here's how i did it now
 

1303
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,789
okay so here's how i did it now
i did it to the side of the portal so

1304
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
i did it to the side of the portal so
 

1305
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,710
i did it to the side of the portal so
that the items can drop in from the top

1306
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
that the items can drop in from the top
 

1307
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,149
that the items can drop in from the top
because i think what's happening

1308
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
because i think what's happening
 

1309
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,230
because i think what's happening
they're going in for in from the bottom

1310
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
they're going in for in from the bottom
 

1311
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,190
they're going in for in from the bottom
but they're

1312
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
but they're
 

1313
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,549
but they're
the portal block is is like a little bit

1314
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
the portal block is is like a little bit
 

1315
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,149
the portal block is is like a little bit
higher up or something i'm not sure

1316
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
higher up or something i'm not sure
 

1317
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,230
higher up or something i'm not sure
exactly

1318
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
exactly
 

1319
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,590
exactly
um so if they drop in from the top they

1320
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:47,600
um so if they drop in from the top they
 

1321
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,070
um so if they drop in from the top they
should work for sure

1322
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
should work for sure
 

1323
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,070
should work for sure

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,029
a water stream that carries them over
and drops them down

1328
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
