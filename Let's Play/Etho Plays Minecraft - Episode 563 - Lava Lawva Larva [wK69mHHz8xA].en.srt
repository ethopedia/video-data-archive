00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
air basically you just need a lava
 

169
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,070
air basically you just need a lava
source a block drip stone under that

170
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
source a block drip stone under that
 

171
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,949
source a block drip stone under that
block and you can see it's dripping

172
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
block and you can see it's dripping
 

173
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,630
block and you can see it's dripping
lava particles into the cauldron after

174
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
lava particles into the cauldron after
 

175
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,990
lava particles into the cauldron after
about 20 minutes it'll fill up and

176
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
about 20 minutes it'll fill up and
 

177
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,589
about 20 minutes it'll fill up and
you've got yourself a brand new source

178
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
you've got yourself a brand new source
 

179
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,309
you've got yourself a brand new source
of lava which is pretty cool now the way

180
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
of lava which is pretty cool now the way
 

181
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,309
of lava which is pretty cool now the way
this works you cannot

182
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
this works you cannot
 

183
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,750
this works you cannot
in any way totally automate this like if

184
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
in any way totally automate this like if
 

185
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,550
in any way totally automate this like if
you

186
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
you
 

187
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,110
you
have a dispenser with empty buckets in

188
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
have a dispenser with empty buckets in
 

189
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,270
have a dispenser with empty buckets in
is this gonna it's gonna cook it

190
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
is this gonna it's gonna cook it
 

191
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,910
is this gonna it's gonna cook it
so the only way to harvest the lava

192
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
so the only way to harvest the lava
 

193
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,070
so the only way to harvest the lava
after it fills up here is to right click

194
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
after it fills up here is to right click
 

195
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,509
after it fills up here is to right click
it yourself so you can right click it

196
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
it yourself so you can right click it
 

197
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,670
it yourself so you can right click it
with a stack of buckets and boom it goes

198
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
with a stack of buckets and boom it goes
 

199
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,390
with a stack of buckets and boom it goes
in your inventory but if your inventory

200
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
in your inventory but if your inventory
 

201
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
in your inventory but if your inventory
is full

202
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
is full
 

203
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,070
is full
like i saw

204
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
like i saw
 

205
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,070
like i saw
then it just shoots out into the world

206
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
then it just shoots out into the world
 

207
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,589
then it just shoots out into the world
so whenever i'm designing something in

208
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
so whenever i'm designing something in
 

209
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,910
so whenever i'm designing something in
this game i like to have a clear goal in

210
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
this game i like to have a clear goal in
 

211
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,229
this game i like to have a clear goal in
mind for what i'm trying to achieve and

212
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
mind for what i'm trying to achieve and
 

213
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,350
mind for what i'm trying to achieve and
for the lava farm here my goal was to

214
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
for the lava farm here my goal was to
 

215
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,350
for the lava farm here my goal was to
try come up with the simplest like

216
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
try come up with the simplest like
 

217
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,869
try come up with the simplest like
repeating pattern

218
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
repeating pattern
 

219
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,670
repeating pattern
i could think of for making a lava farm

220
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
i could think of for making a lava farm
 

221
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,270
i could think of for making a lava farm
so i thought about it for a bit and

222
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
so i thought about it for a bit and
 

223
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,190
so i thought about it for a bit and
basically there's two approaches to this

224
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
basically there's two approaches to this
 

225
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,190
basically there's two approaches to this
number one you either move the lava to

226
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
number one you either move the lava to
 

227
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,390
number one you either move the lava to
you

228
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
you
 

229
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,550
you
or you move yourself to the lava if you

230
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
or you move yourself to the lava if you
 

231
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,390
or you move yourself to the lava if you
want to move the lava to you the only

232
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
want to move the lava to you the only
 

233
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,069
want to move the lava to you the only
way of doing it i think is with the

234
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
way of doing it i think is with the
 

235
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,710
way of doing it i think is with the
cauldron tape like this so

236
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
cauldron tape like this so
 

237
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,909
cauldron tape like this so
or something similar so basically

238
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
or something similar so basically
 

239
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,790
or something similar so basically
you

240
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
you
 

241
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,430
you
would move the cauldrons around

242
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
would move the cauldrons around
 

243
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,150
would move the cauldrons around
which one do we go next this one here

244
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
which one do we go next this one here
 

245
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,310
which one do we go next this one here
in a loop sort of thing and as they fill

246
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
in a loop sort of thing and as they fill
 

247
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,310
in a loop sort of thing and as they fill
up they get delivered to you

248
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
up they get delivered to you
 

249
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,230
up they get delivered to you
so you would stand in one spot and they

250
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
so you would stand in one spot and they
 

251
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,150
so you would stand in one spot and they
would get moved to you and you just hold

252
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
would get moved to you and you just hold
 

253
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,270
would get moved to you and you just hold
right click and they'll fill up your

254
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
right click and they'll fill up your
 

255
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,350
right click and they'll fill up your
inventory the problem with the piston

256
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
inventory the problem with the piston
 

257
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,310
inventory the problem with the piston
tape method is redstone is complicated

258
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
tape method is redstone is complicated
 

259
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,189
tape method is redstone is complicated
to to in a certain extent and piston

260
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
to to in a certain extent and piston
 

261
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,590
to to in a certain extent and piston
tapes kind of need a fixed size so if

262
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
tapes kind of need a fixed size so if
 

263
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,030
tapes kind of need a fixed size so if
you want to make like an infinitely

264
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
you want to make like an infinitely
 

265
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,870
you want to make like an infinitely
repeatable pattern

266
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
repeatable pattern
 

267
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,950
repeatable pattern
this really isn't a good approach so

268
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
this really isn't a good approach so
 

269
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,150
this really isn't a good approach so
instead

270
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
instead
 

271
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,230
instead
i figured out we got to make it so we

272
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
i figured out we got to make it so we
 

273
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,150
i figured out we got to make it so we
moved to the lava now there are a lot of

274
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
moved to the lava now there are a lot of
 

275
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,590
moved to the lava now there are a lot of
different ways of moving around in this

276
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
different ways of moving around in this
 

277
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,350
different ways of moving around in this
game though so we have to pick one like

278
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
game though so we have to pick one like
 

279
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,950
game though so we have to pick one like
are we going to be walking it getting

280
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
are we going to be walking it getting
 

281
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,350
are we going to be walking it getting
pushed around with water streams riding

282
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
pushed around with water streams riding
 

283
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,590
pushed around with water streams riding
a horse what are we doing here well i

284
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
a horse what are we doing here well i
 

285
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,430
a horse what are we doing here well i
figured we got to pick an automatic

286
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
figured we got to pick an automatic
 

287
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,270
figured we got to pick an automatic
method of moving

288
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
method of moving
 

289
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,150
method of moving
would be ideal and

290
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
would be ideal and
 

291
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,510
would be ideal and
it needs to be consistent and also

292
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
it needs to be consistent and also
 

293
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,189
it needs to be consistent and also
we need to set up a collection system

294
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
we need to set up a collection system
 

295
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,469
we need to set up a collection system
with this farm so i figured let's

296
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
with this farm so i figured let's
 

297
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,990
with this farm so i figured let's
combine

298
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
combine
 

299
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,990
combine
our collection system

300
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
our collection system
 

301
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,070
our collection system
with our movement system to try to

302
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
with our movement system to try to
 

303
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,070
with our movement system to try to
create an even simpler pattern

304
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
create an even simpler pattern
 

305
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,150
create an even simpler pattern
and we're gonna basically just do this

306
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
and we're gonna basically just do this
 

307
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,830
and we're gonna basically just do this
we're gonna have water

308
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
we're gonna have water
 

309
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,070
we're gonna have water
water needs to flow at least two blocks

310
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
water needs to flow at least two blocks
 

311
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,350
water needs to flow at least two blocks
so that it

312
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
so that it
 

313
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,110
so that it
has a flow to it all right

314
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
has a flow to it all right
 

315
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,390
has a flow to it all right
and then we're going to take advantage

316
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
and then we're going to take advantage
 

317
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,469
and then we're going to take advantage
of the fact you can now put rails under

318
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
of the fact you can now put rails under
 

319
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,110
of the fact you can now put rails under
water like this

320
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
water like this
 

321
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,390
water like this
and then

322
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
and then
 

323
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,390
and then
we will ride along here in a mine cart

324
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
we will ride along here in a mine cart
 

325
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,189
we will ride along here in a mine cart
our heads above water it's all fine

326
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
our heads above water it's all fine
 

327
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,790
our heads above water it's all fine
oh i'm actually getting pushed

328
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800

 

329
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,110

wait a second

330
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
wait a second
 

331
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,629
wait a second
that was weird i thought i'd have

332
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
that was weird i thought i'd have
 

333
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,870
that was weird i thought i'd have
control here still

334
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
control here still
 

335
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,189
control here still
look the rails

336
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
look the rails
 

337
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,469
look the rails
i didn't know that

338
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
i didn't know that
 

339
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,150
i didn't know that
so if you put a minecart in flowing

340
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
so if you put a minecart in flowing
 

341
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,629
so if you put a minecart in flowing
water it has a preferred way of moving

342
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639

 

343
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,629

weird anyways i'm getting distracted

344
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
weird anyways i'm getting distracted
 

345
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,870
weird anyways i'm getting distracted
yeah so basically

346
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
yeah so basically
 

347
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,469
yeah so basically
as we harvest the lava it's going to

348
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
as we harvest the lava it's going to
 

349
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,309
as we harvest the lava it's going to
shoot off into here go underneath the

350
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
shoot off into here go underneath the
 

351
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,990
shoot off into here go underneath the
slab here and then we'll just have our

352
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
slab here and then we'll just have our
 

353
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,670
slab here and then we'll just have our
next row of cauldrons

354
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
next row of cauldrons
 

355
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,670
next row of cauldrons
right over here so it's a three block

356
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
right over here so it's a three block
 

357
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,070
right over here so it's a three block
wide pattern so then our lava buckets

358
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
wide pattern so then our lava buckets
 

359
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,430
wide pattern so then our lava buckets
are going to go underneath the slabs

360
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
are going to go underneath the slabs
 

361
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,510
are going to go underneath the slabs
here under the cauldrons and land into

362
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
here under the cauldrons and land into
 

363
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,830
here under the cauldrons and land into
another water stream below that's going

364
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
another water stream below that's going
 

365
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,430
another water stream below that's going
to bring all the lava buckets over to

366
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
to bring all the lava buckets over to
 

367
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,189
to bring all the lava buckets over to
one end of our farm they'll get

368
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
one end of our farm they'll get
 

369
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,870
one end of our farm they'll get
collected together go into the shulker

370
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
collected together go into the shulker
 

371
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,469
collected together go into the shulker
loading system and we'll have shocker

372
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
loading system and we'll have shocker
 

373
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,029
loading system and we'll have shocker
boxes full of lava buckets waiting for

374
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
boxes full of lava buckets waiting for
 

375
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,790
boxes full of lava buckets waiting for
us when we're done harvesting here which

376
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
us when we're done harvesting here which
 

377
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,469
us when we're done harvesting here which
will be pretty cool now it's trying to

378
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
will be pretty cool now it's trying to
 

379
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,590
will be pretty cool now it's trying to
figure out how should we actually do

380
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
figure out how should we actually do
 

381
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,749
figure out how should we actually do
this water stream below because i kind

382
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
this water stream below because i kind
 

383
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,909
this water stream below because i kind
of don't want to put break points in our

384
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
of don't want to put break points in our
 

385
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,670
of don't want to put break points in our
farm like between the cauldrons i would

386
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
farm like between the cauldrons i would
 

387
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,790
farm like between the cauldrons i would
rather have

388
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
rather have
 

389
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,430
rather have
break points in our water stream here

390
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
break points in our water stream here
 

391
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,670
break points in our water stream here
because you can't like merge

392
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
because you can't like merge
 

393
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,270
because you can't like merge
two eight block water streams together

394
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
two eight block water streams together
 

395
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,550
two eight block water streams together
right you need a break point at some

396
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
right you need a break point at some
 

397
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,790
right you need a break point at some
point and if the lava bucket was to fall

398
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
point and if the lava bucket was to fall
 

399
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,150
point and if the lava bucket was to fall
down here

400
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
down here
 

401
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,990
down here
well you just lost it

402
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
well you just lost it
 

403
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,749
well you just lost it
so the way i usually would deal with

404
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
so the way i usually would deal with
 

405
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,510
so the way i usually would deal with
like having a continuous water stream is

406
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
like having a continuous water stream is
 

407
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,950
like having a continuous water stream is
you double layer it you have like

408
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
you double layer it you have like
 

409
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,350
you double layer it you have like
another layer over here that goes over

410
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
another layer over here that goes over
 

411
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,309
another layer over here that goes over
the dead points on the lower one

412
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
the dead points on the lower one
 

413
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,629
the dead points on the lower one
and then

414
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
and then
 

415
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,909
and then
if an item lands here

416
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
if an item lands here
 

417
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,830
if an item lands here
it will fall between the crack there no

418
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
it will fall between the crack there no
 

419
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,070
it will fall between the crack there no
problem guaranteed not to land on a dead

420
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
problem guaranteed not to land on a dead
 

421
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,430
problem guaranteed not to land on a dead
point

422
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
point
 

423
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,510
point
or if it was to land like

424
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
or if it was to land like
 

425
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,029
or if it was to land like
at this fence gate here it would go to

426
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
at this fence gate here it would go to
 

427
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,790
at this fence gate here it would go to
the one below as well so there's like no

428
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
the one below as well so there's like no
 

429
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,790
the one below as well so there's like no
point in the water stream where items

430
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
point in the water stream where items
 

431
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,990
point in the water stream where items
can get lost

432
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
can get lost
 

433
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,270
can get lost
i was just trying to think like is there

434
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
i was just trying to think like is there
 

435
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,350
i was just trying to think like is there
a better way of doing it and yes there

436
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
a better way of doing it and yes there
 

437
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,390
a better way of doing it and yes there
is

438
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
is
 

439
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,749
is
basically

440
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
basically
 

441
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,990
basically
i i tested this out it seems to work if

442
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
i i tested this out it seems to work if
 

443
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,670
i i tested this out it seems to work if
you have like uh

444
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
you have like uh
 

445
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,270
you have like uh
it's set up like this only a single

446
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
it's set up like this only a single
 

447
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,670
it's set up like this only a single
layer is needed actually oh

448
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
layer is needed actually oh
 

449
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,670
layer is needed actually oh
let's put that

450
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
let's put that
 

451
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,670
let's put that
we'll have the fence gate here

452
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
we'll have the fence gate here
 

453
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,230
we'll have the fence gate here
water goes over the pressure plates and

454
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
water goes over the pressure plates and
 

455
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,869
water goes over the pressure plates and
it seems like no matter where the item

456
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
it seems like no matter where the item
 

457
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,110
it seems like no matter where the item
lands as long as i think like if it fell

458
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
lands as long as i think like if it fell
 

459
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,710
lands as long as i think like if it fell
far enough down here i think it would

460
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
far enough down here i think it would
 

461
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,469
far enough down here i think it would
get stuck

462
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
get stuck
 

463
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,150
get stuck
but you see if it lands on the ice there

464
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
but you see if it lands on the ice there
 

465
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,070
but you see if it lands on the ice there
it still has some momentum it can

466
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
it still has some momentum it can
 

467
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,350
it still has some momentum it can
actually

468
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
actually
 

469
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,869
actually
carry its way through

470
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879

 

471
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,749

oh i'm a bad thrower

472
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
oh i'm a bad thrower
 

473
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,909
oh i'm a bad thrower
oh it just barely makes it you see that

474
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
oh it just barely makes it you see that
 

475
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,270
oh it just barely makes it you see that
but i think maybe if it fell through

476
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
but i think maybe if it fell through
 

477
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,790
but i think maybe if it fell through
that water fast enough it would get

478
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
that water fast enough it would get
 

479
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,990
that water fast enough it would get
stuck but

480
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
stuck but
 

481
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,350
stuck but
as long as we don't drop the item too

482
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
as long as we don't drop the item too
 

483
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,430
as long as we don't drop the item too
far it seems to work like this no matter

484
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
far it seems to work like this no matter
 

485
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,070
far it seems to work like this no matter
where it lands aha so yeah it's been

486
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
where it lands aha so yeah it's been
 

487
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,550
where it lands aha so yeah it's been
announced guys officially the next

488
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
announced guys officially the next
 

489
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,509
announced guys officially the next
updates 1.18 is coming out november 30th

490
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
updates 1.18 is coming out november 30th
 

491
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,110
updates 1.18 is coming out november 30th
which is pretty cool i was thinking

492
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
which is pretty cool i was thinking
 

493
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,430
which is pretty cool i was thinking
about it today about this patch and uh

494
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
about it today about this patch and uh
 

495
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,949
about it today about this patch and uh
it's pretty crazy what they've done

496
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
it's pretty crazy what they've done
 

497
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,710
it's pretty crazy what they've done
honestly like you think about a lot of

498
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
honestly like you think about a lot of
 

499
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,150
honestly like you think about a lot of
older games

500
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
older games
 

501
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,150
older games
what happens what do they do well the

502
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
what happens what do they do well the
 

503
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,990
what happens what do they do well the
patches get simpler and simpler as time

504
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
patches get simpler and simpler as time
 

505
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,070
patches get simpler and simpler as time
goes on you know they might add a couple

506
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
goes on you know they might add a couple
 

507
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,990
goes on you know they might add a couple
new content things here and there a few

00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
are getting better they can handle it
 

539
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,190

and uh it's pretty cool i like to see

540
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
and uh it's pretty cool i like to see
 

541

that
 

543
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,430
that
uh as far as like what the update is

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
uh as far as like what the update is
 

545

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
not entirely sure i think they changed
 

549

the mob

550
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
the mob
 

551
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,870
the mob
uh spawning right so a lot of our mob

552
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
uh spawning right so a lot of our mob
 

553
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,389
uh spawning right so a lot of our mob
farms are kind of going to be affected

554
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
farms are kind of going to be affected
 

555
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,750
farms are kind of going to be affected
by that i think

556
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
by that i think
 

557
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,110
by that i think
and from what i've seen there's going to

558
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
and from what i've seen there's going to
 

559
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,509
and from what i've seen there's going to
be caves underneath my bedrock so like

560
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
be caves underneath my bedrock so like
 

561
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,750
be caves underneath my bedrock so like
64 blocks below our bedrock is gonna

562
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
64 blocks below our bedrock is gonna
 

563
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,910
64 blocks below our bedrock is gonna
have new caves and we'll probably go

564
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
have new caves and we'll probably go
 

565
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,470
have new caves and we'll probably go
down there and explore and you know

566
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
down there and explore and you know
 

567
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,030
down there and explore and you know
open up the underworld is is kind of the

568
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
open up the underworld is is kind of the
 

569
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,350
open up the underworld is is kind of the
plan at the moment

570
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360

 

571
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,070

i love that sound it's so good

572
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
i love that sound it's so good
 

573
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,269
i love that sound it's so good
uh this stuff grows very slowly like

574
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
uh this stuff grows very slowly like
 

575
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,949
uh this stuff grows very slowly like
very very slowly we only need 288 of it

576
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
very very slowly we only need 288 of it
 

577
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,630
very very slowly we only need 288 of it
that's how many cauldrons we got set up

578
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
that's how many cauldrons we got set up
 

579
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,710
that's how many cauldrons we got set up
that's like over 10 shulkers full of

580
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
that's like over 10 shulkers full of
 

581
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,790
that's like over 10 shulkers full of
lava after a full harvest

582
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
lava after a full harvest
 

583
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,069
lava after a full harvest
but

584
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
but
 

585
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,870
but
uh it's been hours hours hours hours and

586
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
uh it's been hours hours hours hours and
 

587
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,829
uh it's been hours hours hours hours and
this stuff is taken

588
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
this stuff is taken
 

589
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,509
this stuff is taken
forever i just did a little test here

590
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
forever i just did a little test here
 

591
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,870
forever i just did a little test here
because i wanted to make sure we only

592
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
because i wanted to make sure we only
 

593
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,870
because i wanted to make sure we only
have one lava source at this block here

594
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
have one lava source at this block here
 

595
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,269
have one lava source at this block here
right above and then it spreads out the

596
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
right above and then it spreads out the
 

597
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,509
right above and then it spreads out the
ones it spreads to does not create lava

598
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
ones it spreads to does not create lava
 

599
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,829
ones it spreads to does not create lava
just where the lava source is this one

600
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
just where the lava source is this one
 

601
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,750
just where the lava source is this one
has filled up three times in a row none

602
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
has filled up three times in a row none
 

603
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,829
has filled up three times in a row none
of these have filled up so

604
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
of these have filled up so
 

605
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,590
of these have filled up so
we're gonna need to fill this all up

606
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
we're gonna need to fill this all up
 

607
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,430
we're gonna need to fill this all up
with lava the whole thing there's no

608
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
with lava the whole thing there's no
 

609
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,190
with lava the whole thing there's no
cheating oh yeah and with the mine cart

610
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
cheating oh yeah and with the mine cart
 

611
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
cheating oh yeah and with the mine cart
it seems like it'll prefer to go east

612
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
it seems like it'll prefer to go east
 

613
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,150
it seems like it'll prefer to go east
but if we nudge it the other way it will

614
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
but if we nudge it the other way it will
 

615
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,670
but if we nudge it the other way it will
just keep going that way as well so it

616
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
just keep going that way as well so it
 

617
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,829
just keep going that way as well so it
just uh keeps going the way it was going

618
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
just uh keeps going the way it was going
 

619
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,750
just uh keeps going the way it was going
right but i think this is gonna be too

620
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
right but i think this is gonna be too
 

621
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,590
right but i think this is gonna be too
slow so i should probably just use power

622
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
slow so i should probably just use power
 

623
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,750
slow so i should probably just use power
rails

624
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
rails
 

625
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,190
rails
all right so i got a little bit lucky on

626
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
all right so i got a little bit lucky on
 

627
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,790
all right so i got a little bit lucky on
this actually i think power rails would

628
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
this actually i think power rails would
 

629
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,030
this actually i think power rails would
have been too fast like every so often

630
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
have been too fast like every so often
 

631
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,470
have been too fast like every so often
we would miss picking up the lava

632
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
we would miss picking up the lava
 

633
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,870
we would miss picking up the lava
buckets as we passed by

634
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
buckets as we passed by
 

635
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,710
buckets as we passed by
but it seems if you combine power rails

636
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
but it seems if you combine power rails
 

637
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,030
but it seems if you combine power rails
with water it actually provides a bit of

638
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
with water it actually provides a bit of
 

639
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,949
with water it actually provides a bit of
resistance and this is like the perfect

640
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
resistance and this is like the perfect
 

641
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,470
resistance and this is like the perfect
speed

642
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
speed
 

643
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,630
speed
all right everybody so i've been hard at

644
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
all right everybody so i've been hard at
 

645
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,150
all right everybody so i've been hard at
work here working on this lava farm and

646
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
work here working on this lava farm and
 

647
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,590
work here working on this lava farm and
i'm very happy to say i think it's

648
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
i'm very happy to say i think it's
 

649
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,910
i'm very happy to say i think it's
totally finished now i just gotta go

650
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920

655
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,710
few things and we'll go for a test run
of it as well

656

so to begin with we have this opening
 

659
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,630
so to begin with we have this opening
here right and i thought this kind of

660
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
here right and i thought this kind of
 

661
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,150
here right and i thought this kind of
works we need some way of getting down

662
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
works we need some way of getting down
 

663
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,069
works we need some way of getting down
there and i'm in a mine cart so we just

664
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
there and i'm in a mine cart so we just
 

665
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,230
there and i'm in a mine cart so we just
have a minecart track at the top here we

666
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
have a minecart track at the top here we
 

667
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,990
have a minecart track at the top here we
hit the button and bam we'll get taken

668
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
hit the button and bam we'll get taken
 

669
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,470
hit the button and bam we'll get taken
down into the farm and then we end up on

670
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
down into the farm and then we end up on
 

671
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,389
down into the farm and then we end up on
the other side and then if we go down on

672
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
the other side and then if we go down on
 

673
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,910
the other side and then if we go down on
the other side we end up on the side

674
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
the other side we end up on the side
 

675
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,310

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
but uh yeah we got the minecart track in
 

723
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,670
but uh yeah we got the minecart track in
we went for power rails

724
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
we went for power rails
 

725
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,550

uh we got our collection system joining
 

727
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,310
uh we got our collection system joining
all the rows together here and they end

up in the middle they go underneath to a
 

731
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,030
up in the middle they go underneath to a
shulker loading system but uh yeah i

732
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
shulker loading system but uh yeah i
 

733
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,389
shulker loading system but uh yeah i
think we're ready to go here for a

think we're ready to go here for a
 

735
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,550
think we're ready to go here for a
little test run so let's do it this is

736
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
little test run so let's do it this is
 

737
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,069
little test run so let's do it this is
my absolute favorite part of building

738
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
my absolute favorite part of building
 

739
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,829
my absolute favorite part of building
something when you you spend all the

740
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
something when you you spend all the
 

741
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,269
something when you you spend all the
time building it up and it's like is it

time building it up and it's like is it
 

743
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,550
time building it up and it's like is it
gonna work is it gonna work and then you

744
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
gonna work is it gonna work and then you
 

745
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,829
gonna work is it gonna work and then you
go for the test run and oh

746
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
go for the test run and oh
 

747
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,230
go for the test run and oh
baby or else it's a oh i messed up

748
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
baby or else it's a oh i messed up
 

749
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,069
baby or else it's a oh i messed up
greatly on this thing

750
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
greatly on this thing
 

751
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,310
greatly on this thing
time to fix it uh no we'll see what

752
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
time to fix it uh no we'll see what
 

753
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,509
time to fix it uh no we'll see what
happens here i don't i don't see how

754
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
happens here i don't i don't see how
 

755
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,269
happens here i don't i don't see how
this could go wrong though so the idea

756
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
this could go wrong though so the idea
 

757
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,030
this could go wrong though so the idea
is we'll pick up some buckets fill up

758
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
is we'll pick up some buckets fill up
 

759
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,509
is we'll pick up some buckets fill up
our inventory and then

760
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
our inventory and then
 

761
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,590
our inventory and then
head down we face this way and just kind

762
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
head down we face this way and just kind
 

763
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,790
head down we face this way and just kind
of hold right click the whole way

764
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
of hold right click the whole way
 

765
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,470
of hold right click the whole way
through

766
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
through
 

767
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,150
through
and they'll shoot out of our inventory

768
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
and they'll shoot out of our inventory
 

769
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,790
and they'll shoot out of our inventory
the land and the water stream below

770
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
the land and the water stream below
 

771
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,269
the land and the water stream below
oh yeah and when it fills up uh or when

772
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
oh yeah and when it fills up uh or when
 

773
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,069
oh yeah and when it fills up uh or when
our

774
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
our
 

775
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,509
our
when we run out of empty buckets then we

776
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
when we run out of empty buckets then we
 

777
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,190
when we run out of empty buckets then we
got a switch too

778
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
got a switch too
 

779
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,990
got a switch too
so this now this farm could be totally

780
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
so this now this farm could be totally
 

781
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,389
so this now this farm could be totally
automated right i decided not to totally

782
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
automated right i decided not to totally
 

783
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,670
automated right i decided not to totally
automate it though

784
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
automate it though
 

785
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,990
automate it though
because i kind of like uh manual farms

786
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
because i kind of like uh manual farms
 

787
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
because i kind of like uh manual farms
to a certain extent

788
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
to a certain extent
 

789
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,430
to a certain extent
or i like the idea of having like tons

790
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
or i like the idea of having like tons
 

791
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,790
or i like the idea of having like tons
of lava here and we just go for a

792
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
of lava here and we just go for a
 

793
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,150
of lava here and we just go for a
harvest right

794
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
harvest right
 

795
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,710
harvest right
so it's quick to get it it's easy but

796
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
so it's quick to get it it's easy but
 

797
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,069
so it's quick to get it it's easy but
i'm still involved in the actual

798
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
i'm still involved in the actual
 

799
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,509
i'm still involved in the actual
collection process

800
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
collection process
 

801
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,990
collection process
i think that's kind of the dream

802
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
i think that's kind of the dream
 

803
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,230
i think that's kind of the dream
i don't really like the afk farm now we

804
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
i don't really like the afk farm now we
 

805
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,910
i don't really like the afk farm now we
got to double check that stuff isn't

806
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
got to double check that stuff isn't
 

807
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,550
got to double check that stuff isn't
landing where it shouldn't here

808
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
landing where it shouldn't here
 

809

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
okay so we need a lot of buckets
 

821
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,350
okay so we need a lot of buckets
i thought i thought that would be more

822
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
i thought i thought that would be more
 

823
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,430
i thought i thought that would be more
than enough i didn't count it uh but

824
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
than enough i didn't count it uh but
 

825
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,790
than enough i didn't count it uh but

yeah they're filling up our shocker
 

827
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,230
yeah they're filling up our shocker
loader here

828
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
loader here
 

829
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,350
loader here
um and they when it totally fills up oh

830
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
um and they when it totally fills up oh
 

831
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,550
um and they when it totally fills up oh
i guess that was all that had

832
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
i guess that was all that had
 

833
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,710
i guess that was all that had
there it goes it breaks it those go down

834
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
there it goes it breaks it those go down
 

835
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,189
there it goes it breaks it those go down
into here we got five

836
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
into here we got five
 

837
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,030
into here we got five
uh there yeah i said there would be

838
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
uh there yeah i said there would be
 

839
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,030
uh there yeah i said there would be
about 10 right so i guess there was a

840
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
about 10 right so i guess there was a
 

841
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,550
about 10 right so i guess there was a
bit more to go

842
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
bit more to go
 

843
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,670
bit more to go
um

844
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
um
 

845
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,389
um
but then the minecart goes back up

846
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399

 

847
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,389

okay we might have a little bit of loss

848
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
okay we might have a little bit of loss
 

849
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,910
okay we might have a little bit of loss
with this and we'll see

850
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
with this and we'll see
 

851
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,350
with this and we'll see
but i don't think it'll be too bad oh

852
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
but i don't think it'll be too bad oh
 

853
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,389
but i don't think it'll be too bad oh
there is one here too one there okay so

854
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
there is one here too one there okay so
 

855
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,310
there is one here too one there okay so
there is a couple problems nothing major

856
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
there is a couple problems nothing major
 

857
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,230
there is a couple problems nothing major
though which which is fine i just want

858
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
though which which is fine i just want
 

859
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,910
though which which is fine i just want
to double check this as well make sure

860
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
to double check this as well make sure
 

861
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,509
to double check this as well make sure
there's nothing stuck on these pressure

862
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
there's nothing stuck on these pressure
 

863
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,509
there's nothing stuck on these pressure
plates

864
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
plates
 

865
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,350
plates
yeah i think this worked okay like we

866
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
yeah i think this worked okay like we
 

867
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,790
yeah i think this worked okay like we
were getting a bunch of lava buckets on

868
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
were getting a bunch of lava buckets on
 

869
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,710
were getting a bunch of lava buckets on
the very end here but i think if we put

870
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
the very end here but i think if we put
 

871
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,550
the very end here but i think if we put
glass over here we can still pass

872
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
glass over here we can still pass
 

873
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,870
glass over here we can still pass
underneath that but we won't throw uh

874
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
underneath that but we won't throw uh
 

875
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,230
underneath that but we won't throw uh
the buckets out

876
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
the buckets out
 

877
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,150
the buckets out
on the side here

878
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160

 

879
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,949

how did i do that

880
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
how did i do that
 

881
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,870
how did i do that
oh i guess if i right click with the

882
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
oh i guess if i right click with the
 

883
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,710
oh i guess if i right click with the
full bucket when i'm in the glass

884
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
full bucket when i'm in the glass
 

885
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,829
full bucket when i'm in the glass
is that what happened then

886
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839

 

887
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,829

happened again wait a second

888
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839

 

889
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,269

is it a big deal i don't know i don't

890
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
is it a big deal i don't know i don't
 

891
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,189
is it a big deal i don't know i don't
know what's happening

892
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
know what's happening
 

893
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,949
know what's happening
as long as i'm not actually placing the

894
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
as long as i'm not actually placing the
 

895
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,230
as long as i'm not actually placing the
lava i think we're fine

896
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240

 

897
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,829

again

898
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
again
 

899
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,749
again
all right let's double check

900
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
all right let's double check
 

901
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,310
all right let's double check
any lava buckets and you'll have buckets

902
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
any lava buckets and you'll have buckets
 

903
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,509
any lava buckets and you'll have buckets
i don't see any lava buckets very good

904
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
i don't see any lava buckets very good
 

905
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,910
i don't see any lava buckets very good
very good i think they all went down

906
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
very good i think they all went down
 

907
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,310
very good i think they all went down
oh boy okay decision time guys do we

908
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
oh boy okay decision time guys do we
 

909
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,069
oh boy okay decision time guys do we
keep the guard on the front of the farm

910
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
keep the guard on the front of the farm
 

911
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,829
keep the guard on the front of the farm
here or do we remove it it'll look

912
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
here or do we remove it it'll look
 

913
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,509
here or do we remove it it'll look
better without the guard i think but

914
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
better without the guard i think but
 

915
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,949
better without the guard i think but
it'll function better with it

916
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
it'll function better with it
 

917
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,269
it'll function better with it
i don't know i'll let you guys decide i

918
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279

you see how we got a brown mushroom down

940
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
you see how we got a brown mushroom down
 

941
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,710
you see how we got a brown mushroom down
there those grow randomly i think he

942
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
there those grow randomly i think he
 

943
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,629
there those grow randomly i think he
stole a brown mushroom you see it's in

944
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
stole a brown mushroom you see it's in
 

945
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,949
stole a brown mushroom you see it's in
his hand and then one grew where he was

946
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
his hand and then one grew where he was
 

947
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,389
his hand and then one grew where he was
standing

948
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
standing
 

949
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,790
standing
and he cannot place that down now he's

950
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
and he cannot place that down now he's
 

951
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,150
and he cannot place that down now he's
stuck

952
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
stuck
 

953
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,470
stuck
because there's one in the spot

954
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
because there's one in the spot
 

955
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,110
because there's one in the spot
again so he can't place that down which

956
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
again so he can't place that down which
 

957
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,110
again so he can't place that down which
means he can't despawn

958
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
means he can't despawn
 

959
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,590
means he can't despawn
and he for some reason he can't teleport

960
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
and he for some reason he can't teleport
 

961
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,430
and he for some reason he can't teleport
out of there either he hasn't tried to

962
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
out of there either he hasn't tried to
 

963
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,110
out of there either he hasn't tried to
so he's just like permanently stuck in

964
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
so he's just like permanently stuck in
 

965
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,030
so he's just like permanently stuck in
this hole all right good stuff so i

move on and i think we're gonna head to

970
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
move on and i think we're gonna head to
 

971
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,990
move on and i think we're gonna head to
the end next yeah so i thought we would

972
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
the end next yeah so i thought we would
 

973
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,749
the end next yeah so i thought we would
go check out the shulker reactor again

974
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
go check out the shulker reactor again
 

975
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,030
go check out the shulker reactor again
today i know a lot of you guys really

976
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
today i know a lot of you guys really
 

977
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,030
today i know a lot of you guys really
like this farm and you wanted to see it

978
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
like this farm and you wanted to see it
 

979
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,509
like this farm and you wanted to see it
in full action so we got a few guys

980
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
in full action so we got a few guys
 

981
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,110
in full action so we got a few guys
stored on the sides here we're gonna

982
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
stored on the sides here we're gonna
 

983
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,269
stored on the sides here we're gonna
send them into the middle

984
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
send them into the middle
 

985
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,710
send them into the middle
and then we'll we'll see what it's like

986
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
and then we'll we'll see what it's like
 

987
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,350
and then we'll we'll see what it's like
when it's when it's crazy

988
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
when it's when it's crazy
 

989
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,870
when it's when it's crazy
i have been using this a fair bit

990
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
i have been using this a fair bit
 

991
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,949
i have been using this a fair bit
testing it out some more it does have a

992
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
testing it out some more it does have a
 

993
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,390
testing it out some more it does have a
couple problems

994
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
couple problems
 

995
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,870
couple problems
but i did i i was able to farm a few

996
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
but i did i i was able to farm a few
 

997
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,789
but i did i i was able to farm a few
stacks of shells from it so it like it's

998
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
stacks of shells from it so it like it's
 

999
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,949
stacks of shells from it so it like it's
working but it needs some tweaking is

1000
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
working but it needs some tweaking is
 

1001
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,189
working but it needs some tweaking is
kind of where we're at with it

1002
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
kind of where we're at with it
 

1003
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,549
kind of where we're at with it
and i'm having trouble flying today

1004
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
and i'm having trouble flying today
 

1005
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,549
and i'm having trouble flying today
apparently okay let's land so what i'm

1006
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
apparently okay let's land so what i'm
 

1007
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,309
apparently okay let's land so what i'm
gonna do i'm gonna send these guys into

1008
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
gonna do i'm gonna send these guys into
 

1009
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,669
gonna do i'm gonna send these guys into
the middle

1010
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
the middle
 

1011
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,909
the middle
just by washing them away

1012
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
just by washing them away
 

1013
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,430
just by washing them away
but i think what we really need to do

1014
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
but i think what we really need to do
 

1015
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,830
but i think what we really need to do
for this farm like to make it work well

1016
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
for this farm like to make it work well
 

1017
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,750
for this farm like to make it work well
is we need to rinse the sides every so

1018
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
is we need to rinse the sides every so
 

1019
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,190
is we need to rinse the sides every so
often and

1020
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
often and
 

1021
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,870
often and
and not just when we choose like set it

1022
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
and not just when we choose like set it
 

1023
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,430
and not just when we choose like set it
up on an actual timer

1024
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
up on an actual timer
 

1025
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,950
up on an actual timer
okay

1026
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
okay
 

1027
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,590
okay
so once the sides are covered in water

1028
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
so once the sides are covered in water
 

1029
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,190
so once the sides are covered in water
they can't teleport to the trap doors

1030
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
they can't teleport to the trap doors
 

1031
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,150
they can't teleport to the trap doors
anymore

1032
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
anymore
 

1033
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,270
anymore
so they teleport to the outside

1034
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
so they teleport to the outside
 

1035
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,110
so they teleport to the outside
and then the ring of water washes them

1036
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
and then the ring of water washes them
 

1037
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,430
and then the ring of water washes them
again and then they'll teleport inside

1038
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
again and then they'll teleport inside
 

1039
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,110
again and then they'll teleport inside
and then we remove the water on the

1040
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
and then we remove the water on the
 

1041
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,270
and then we remove the water on the
outside again and they can teleport back

1042
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
outside again and they can teleport back
 

1043
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,950
outside again and they can teleport back
over to the trap doors and we end up

1044
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
over to the trap doors and we end up
 

1045
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,789
over to the trap doors and we end up
with the situation where there's like a

1046
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
with the situation where there's like a
 

1047
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,630
with the situation where there's like a
hundred of them in the middle reactor

1048
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
hundred of them in the middle reactor
 

1049
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,150
hundred of them in the middle reactor
now

1050
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
now
 

1051
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,549
now
and things get pretty fun so i guess

1052
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
and things get pretty fun so i guess
 

1053
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,990
and things get pretty fun so i guess
let's go check her out

1054
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
let's go check her out
 

1055
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,590
let's go check her out
here we go

1056
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600

 

1057
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,669

i love this farm

1058
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679

 

1059
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,190

so yeah there's there's a few guys in

1060
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
so yeah there's there's a few guys in
 

1061
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,070
so yeah there's there's a few guys in
here at the moment

1062
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
here at the moment
 

1063
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,950
here at the moment
now unfortunately it's not gonna like

1064
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
now unfortunately it's not gonna like
 

1065
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,190
now unfortunately it's not gonna like
sustain this in in any way they're gonna

1066
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
sustain this in in any way they're gonna
 

1067
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,549
sustain this in in any way they're gonna
teleport out of here they're gonna kill

1068
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
teleport out of here they're gonna kill
 

1069
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,789
teleport out of here they're gonna kill
themselves they can't duplicate when

1070
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
themselves they can't duplicate when
 

1071
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,029
themselves they can't duplicate when
there's this many in the middle

1072
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
there's this many in the middle
 

1073
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,950
there's this many in the middle
um so they they gotta teleport out of

1074
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
um so they they gotta teleport out of
 

1075
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,190
um so they they gotta teleport out of
here first

1076
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
here first
 

1077
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,070
here first
but yeah it's pretty fun still

1078
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
but yeah it's pretty fun still
 

1079
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,909
but yeah it's pretty fun still
oh there's not that many over here i

1080
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
oh there's not that many over here i
 

1081
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,070
oh there's not that many over here i
guess this was kind of a dead spot

1082
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
guess this was kind of a dead spot
 

1083
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,909
guess this was kind of a dead spot
so what i found is if i run this farm

1084
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
so what i found is if i run this farm
 

1085
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,789
so what i found is if i run this farm
for a long long long time like hours

1086
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
for a long long long time like hours
 

1087
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,350
for a long long long time like hours
eventually everybody thins out in here

1088
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
eventually everybody thins out in here
 

1089
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,950
eventually everybody thins out in here
and they all end up on the outside walls

1090
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
and they all end up on the outside walls
 

1091
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,270
and they all end up on the outside walls
so i gotta do some tweaking with like uh

1092
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
so i gotta do some tweaking with like uh
 

1093
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,470
so i gotta do some tweaking with like uh
how much space they can teleport to

1094
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
how much space they can teleport to
 

1095
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,669
how much space they can teleport to
i think i'm gonna remove some of the

1096
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
i think i'm gonna remove some of the
 

1097
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,909
i think i'm gonna remove some of the
trapdoors on the outside there

1098
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
trapdoors on the outside there
 

1099
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,990
trapdoors on the outside there
and uh just go from there

1100
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
and uh just go from there
 

1101
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,590
and uh just go from there
and then if we set up that rinsing

1102
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
and then if we set up that rinsing
 

1103
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,110
and then if we set up that rinsing
system on the outside i think this farm

1104
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
system on the outside i think this farm
 

1105
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,789
system on the outside i think this farm
will work pretty well

1106
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
will work pretty well
 

1107
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,549
will work pretty well
uh-huh yeah so it's a little bit hard to

1108
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
uh-huh yeah so it's a little bit hard to
 

1109
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,549
uh-huh yeah so it's a little bit hard to
explain this is a complicated farm but

1110
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
explain this is a complicated farm but
 

1111
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,190
explain this is a complicated farm but
essentially our problem at the moment

1112
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
essentially our problem at the moment
 

1113
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,669
essentially our problem at the moment
is when they duplicate in the reactor

1114
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
is when they duplicate in the reactor
 

1115
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,110
is when they duplicate in the reactor
some of them will teleport to the

1116
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
some of them will teleport to the
 

1117
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,789
some of them will teleport to the
trapdoors and some of them will

1118
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
trapdoors and some of them will
 

1119
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,470
trapdoors and some of them will
duplicate within the reactor and keep

1120
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
duplicate within the reactor and keep
 

1121
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,549
duplicate within the reactor and keep
the reaction going the ones on the

1122
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
the reaction going the ones on the
 

1123
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,470
the reaction going the ones on the
outside are like extra storage they get

1124
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
outside are like extra storage they get
 

1125
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,310
outside are like extra storage they get
out of the way so that uh there's not

1126
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
out of the way so that uh there's not
 

1127
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,909
out of the way so that uh there's not
too many in the middle that it stops the

1128
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
too many in the middle that it stops the
 

1129
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,909
too many in the middle that it stops the
reaction from happening

1130
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
reaction from happening
 

1131
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,230
reaction from happening
but the issue at the moment is too many

1132
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
but the issue at the moment is too many
 

1133
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,750
but the issue at the moment is too many
of them are teleporting to the trap

1134
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
of them are teleporting to the trap
 

1135
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,350
of them are teleporting to the trap
doors and eventually there's not enough

1136
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
doors and eventually there's not enough
 

1137
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,990
doors and eventually there's not enough
in the middle they all kind of die out

1138
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
in the middle they all kind of die out
 

1139
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,870
in the middle they all kind of die out
and then the reaction stops

1140
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
and then the reaction stops
 

1141
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,750
and then the reaction stops
and

1142
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
and
 

1143
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,990
and
yeah then we have to send them all from

1144
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
yeah then we have to send them all from
 

1145
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,029
yeah then we have to send them all from
the outside back inside but if we just

1146
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
the outside back inside but if we just
 

1147
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,549
the outside back inside but if we just
get rid of the middle row here it will

1148
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
get rid of the middle row here it will
 

1149
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,310
get rid of the middle row here it will
probably help things out a lot and

1150
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
probably help things out a lot and
 

1151
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,390
probably help things out a lot and
though more will stay inside and fewer

1152
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
though more will stay inside and fewer
 

1153
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,870
though more will stay inside and fewer
will go to the trapdoors

1154
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880

 

1155
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,789

all right found something out new here

1156
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
all right found something out new here
 

1157
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,590
all right found something out new here
that i didn't know uh i was removing the

1158
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
that i didn't know uh i was removing the
 

1159
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,590
that i didn't know uh i was removing the
middles on the trapdoors right and there

1160
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
middles on the trapdoors right and there
 

1161
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,110
middles on the trapdoors right and there
were a couple shulkers on the outside

1162
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
were a couple shulkers on the outside
 

1163
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,070
were a couple shulkers on the outside
still so i had to remove them with my

1164
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
still so i had to remove them with my
 

1165
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,270
still so i had to remove them with my
trident

1166
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
trident
 

1167
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,549
trident
and uh

1168
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
and uh
 

1169
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,950
and uh
i might have missed and my trident went

1170
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
i might have missed and my trident went
 

1171
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,430
i might have missed and my trident went
into the void and apparently even if it

1172
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
into the void and apparently even if it
 

1173
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,190
into the void and apparently even if it
has loyalty on it and it goes in the

1174
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
has loyalty on it and it goes in the
 

1175
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,149
has loyalty on it and it goes in the
void

1176
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
void
 

1177
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,789
void
uh it doesn't come back to you so i just

1178
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
uh it doesn't come back to you so i just
 

1179
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,990
uh it doesn't come back to you so i just
threw my trident

1180
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
threw my trident
 

1181
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,149
threw my trident
in the void okay i know this looks kind

1182
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
in the void okay i know this looks kind
 

1183
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,470
in the void okay i know this looks kind
of bad but just hear me out for a second

1184
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
of bad but just hear me out for a second

for a long time now i've needed to build
 

1193
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,190
for a long time now i've needed to build
a villager system like a villager

1194
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
a villager system like a villager
 

1195
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,110
a villager system like a villager
trading system a good one too i don't

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
something unique as well
 

1203
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,870
something unique as well
and i just haven't really been able to

1204
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
and i just haven't really been able to
 

1205
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,669
and i just haven't really been able to
figure out what to do until today

1206
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
figure out what to do until today
 

1207
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,909

the idea hit me had a eureka moment okay

1208
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
the idea hit me had a eureka moment okay
 

1209
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,310
the idea hit me had a eureka moment okay
uh but it hinges on whether or not this

1210
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
uh but it hinges on whether or not this
 

1211
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,630
uh but it hinges on whether or not this
guy can restock his supply

guy can restock his supply
 

1213
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,549
guy can restock his supply
the idea is

1214
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
the idea is
 

1215
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,710
the idea is
i'm gonna drown the guy pretty much he's

gonna be in water
 

1219
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,510
gonna be in water
right this is how i'm gonna keep my

1220
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
right this is how i'm gonna keep my
 

1221
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,630
right this is how i'm gonna keep my
villagers

1222

the bubble columns will keep him alive
 

1225
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,110
the bubble columns will keep him alive
though he's not going to drown and like

whenever i do a trade with them
and the the inventory you know that's

1230
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
and the the inventory you know that's
 

1231
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,669
and the the inventory you know that's
the big problem with villager trading

1232
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
the big problem with villager trading
 

1233
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,029
the big problem with villager trading
the inventory

1234
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
the inventory
 

1235
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,909
the inventory
you

1236
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
you
 

1237
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,510
you
have stuff flying everywhere right you

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
have stuff flying everywhere right you
 

1239
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,870
have stuff flying everywhere right you
got to pick stuff up you got to drop

1240
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
got to pick stuff up you got to drop
 

1241
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,830
got to pick stuff up you got to drop
stuff off i want the inventory to just

1242
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
stuff off i want the inventory to just
 

1243
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,430
stuff off i want the inventory to just
shoot into the water stream and go into

1244
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
shoot into the water stream and go into
 

1245
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,590
shoot into the water stream and go into
a collection system and and sort it for

1246
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
a collection system and and sort it for
 

1247
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,909
a collection system and and sort it for
me and this is a perfect way of doing it

1248
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
me and this is a perfect way of doing it
 

1249
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,470
me and this is a perfect way of doing it
if if they just stay in the water stream

1250
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
if if they just stay in the water stream
 

1251
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,149
if if they just stay in the water stream
right

1252
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
right
 

1253
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,070
right
because i can just funnel the water

1254
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
because i can just funnel the water
 

1255
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,510
because i can just funnel the water
stream wherever i want with the items

1256
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
stream wherever i want with the items
 

1257
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,029
stream wherever i want with the items
inside and it's going to be amazing now

1258
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
inside and it's going to be amazing now
 

1259
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,029
inside and it's going to be amazing now
can he actually restock we got this

thing next to him
 

1263
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,669
thing next to him
uh i think he should be able to right

1264
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
uh i think he should be able to right
 

1265
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,830
uh i think he should be able to right
i'm just going to make sure let's do a

1266
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
i'm just going to make sure let's do a
 

1267
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,830
i'm just going to make sure let's do a
little bit of trading here with this guy

1268
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
little bit of trading here with this guy
 

1269
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,430
little bit of trading here with this guy
and we will find out

1270
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
and we will find out
 

1271
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,549
and we will find out
i want all the bricks he got buddy

1272

okay

1274
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
okay
 

1275
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,510
okay
he can't he can't trade anymore let's

1276
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
he can't he can't trade anymore let's
 

1277

give him a bit of time
 

1279
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,950
give him a bit of time
oh snappers all right i think it's gonna

1280
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
oh snappers all right i think it's gonna
 

1281
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,870
oh snappers all right i think it's gonna
work he was able to restock which is

1282
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
work he was able to restock which is
 

1283
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,950
work he was able to restock which is
great so yeah the idea is if he's in

great so yeah the idea is if he's in
 

1285
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,789
great so yeah the idea is if he's in
water we can deliver all the items

1286
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
water we can deliver all the items
 

1287
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,710
water we can deliver all the items
wherever we want that way nice and easy

1288
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
wherever we want that way nice and easy
 

1289
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,750
wherever we want that way nice and easy
plus any xp he creates

1290
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
plus any xp he creates
 

1291
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,669
plus any xp he creates
will get shot through the system as well

1292
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
will get shot through the system as well
 

1293
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,029
will get shot through the system as well
cool all right well i think that's what

1294
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
cool all right well i think that's what
 

1295
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,710
cool all right well i think that's what
we're gonna go with then i'll have to do

1296
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
we're gonna go with then i'll have to do
 

1297
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,630
we're gonna go with then i'll have to do
a bit of fine tuning and you know it'll

1298
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
a bit of fine tuning and you know it'll
 

1299
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,549
a bit of fine tuning and you know it'll
take a bit to make it look good as well

1300
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
take a bit to make it look good as well
 

1301
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,789
take a bit to make it look good as well
but uh i think it's gonna work out i'll

1302
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
but uh i think it's gonna work out i'll
 

1303
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,390
but uh i think it's gonna work out i'll
try to get that figured out for the next

1304
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
try to get that figured out for the next
 

1305
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,310
try to get that figured out for the next
episode everybody but unfortunately for

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
today it is that time for the comment of
 

1309
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,549
today it is that time for the comment of
the day it says etho

1310
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
the day it says etho
 

1311

do you know that there are different

1312
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
do you know that there are different
 

1313
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,350
do you know that there are different
variations of flight rockets you don't

1314
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
variations of flight rockets you don't
 

1315
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,909
variations of flight rockets you don't
have to use the level one ones craft a

1316
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
have to use the level one ones craft a
 

1317
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,630
have to use the level one ones craft a
rocket with three gun powder instead of

1318
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
rocket with three gun powder instead of
 

1319
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,149
rocket with three gun powder instead of
one

1320
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
one
 

1321
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,070

people have played around with so
 

1327
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,510
people have played around with so
i used to always use rocket threes like

1328
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
i used to always use rocket threes like
 

1329
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,470

ones and then i started using them
 

1335
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,070
ones and then i started using them
because that's what people gave me or

found out i actually really prefer the
 

1341
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,909
found out i actually really prefer the
rocket ones

1342
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
rocket ones
 

1343
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,830
rocket ones
they don't last as long it's true that

1344
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
they don't last as long it's true that
 

1345
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,669
they don't last as long it's true that
it's like less value for the inventory

1346
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
it's like less value for the inventory
 

1347
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,590

00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
and i find rocket threes
 

1361
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,230

you just spend most of time waiting for

1362
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
you just spend most of time waiting for
 

1363
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,669
you just spend most of time waiting for
the rocket to run out before you can

into the wall and die
 

1369
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,390
into the wall and die
uh so yeah i much prefer rocket ones

1370
