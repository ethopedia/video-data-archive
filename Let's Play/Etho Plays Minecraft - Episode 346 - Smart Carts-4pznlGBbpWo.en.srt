where we're gonna build a mobile storage
 

17
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,700
where we're gonna build a mobile storage
room at our amplified terrain area we're

18
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:28,710
room at our amplified terrain area we're
 

19
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,849
room at our amplified terrain area we're
gonna try to get that going today but in

20
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:31,859
gonna try to get that going today but in

my creative world here I've been working
 

23
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,780
my creative world here I've been working
out the little details on how it's gonna

24
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:35,790
out the little details on how it's gonna
 

25
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,830
out the little details on how it's gonna
work and I am pretty happy with what we

26
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
work and I am pretty happy with what we
 

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,510

got here it looks like it's gonna go
 

29
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,430

okay so just to rehash the idea with you

30
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,440
okay so just to rehash the idea with you
 

31
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,650
okay so just to rehash the idea with you
basically we're gonna build these

32
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:48,660
basically we're gonna build these
 

33
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,840
basically we're gonna build these
storage room shells we're gonna have a

34
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
storage room shells we're gonna have a
 

35
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,040
storage room shells we're gonna have a
few of them around

36
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,050
few of them around
 

37
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,330
few of them around
amplified terrain and the storage

38
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,340
amplified terrain and the storage
 

39
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,130
amplified terrain and the storage
minecarts are gonna move between the

40
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,140
minecarts are gonna move between the
 

41
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,670
minecarts are gonna move between the
different storage room areas and

42
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
different storage room areas and
 

43
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,590
different storage room areas and
depending on where I am in the amplified

44
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
depending on where I am in the amplified
 

45
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,050
depending on where I am in the amplified
terrain world and just hit a button at

46
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,060
terrain world and just hit a button at
 

47
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,820
terrain world and just hit a button at
one of the storage rooms nearby and all

48
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
one of the storage rooms nearby and all
 

49
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,649
one of the storage rooms nearby and all
the contents will move to where I'm at

50
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:09,659
the contents will move to where I'm at
 

51
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,270
the contents will move to where I'm at
and that way I don't have to keep

52
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
and that way I don't have to keep
 

53
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,100
and that way I don't have to keep
running back and forth or setting up

54
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,110
running back and forth or setting up
 

55
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,380
running back and forth or setting up
temporary chests all over the place

56
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
temporary chests all over the place
 

57
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,240
temporary chests all over the place
because I do that in the man cave and I

58
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,250
because I do that in the man cave and I
 

59
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,090
because I do that in the man cave and I
got to tell you it is annoying I waste

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,100
got to tell you it is annoying I waste
 

61
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,370
got to tell you it is annoying I waste
like two three minutes every time I

62
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
like two three minutes every time I
 

63
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,690
like two three minutes every time I
forget an item when I'm building

64
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
forget an item when I'm building
 

65
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,690
forget an item when I'm building
something in there and sometimes I'll

66
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
something in there and sometimes I'll
 

67
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,350
something in there and sometimes I'll
like set up temporary chests and fill

68
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360
like set up temporary chests and fill
 

69
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,319
like set up temporary chests and fill
them up with junk and then I finish up

70
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
them up with junk and then I finish up
 

71
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,999
them up with junk and then I finish up
my project and I totally forget about

my project and I totally forget about
 

73
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,710
my project and I totally forget about
the stuff in the chests and it's like

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
loaded with pistons and redstone and so
 

83
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,870
loaded with pistons and redstone and so
I've done that quite a few times

84
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
I've done that quite a few times
 

85
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,120
I've done that quite a few times
hopefully with this mobile storage room

86
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,130
hopefully with this mobile storage room
 

87
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,450
hopefully with this mobile storage room
idea that's not gonna happen as much so

88
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,460
idea that's not gonna happen as much so
 

89
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,249

just got a test setup here I don't have
 

93
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,749
just got a test setup here I don't have
several stations set up I just have one

several stations set up I just have one
 

95
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,359
several stations set up I just have one
setup and it's feeding into itself using

this mine Kirt loop looping track so

98
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:06,500
this mine Kirt loop looping track so
 

99
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,219
this mine Kirt loop looping track so
here we go this is what it does press

100
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:10,229
here we go this is what it does press
 

101
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,970
here we go this is what it does press
the button get it going and it sends out

train type of deal and then they all

106
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
train type of deal and then they all
 

107
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,539
train type of deal and then they all
funnel in at the next station they'll

108
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:23,549
funnel in at the next station they'll
 

109
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,729
funnel in at the next station they'll
fall in from the top like that and they

110
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:25,739
fall in from the top like that and they
 

111
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,039
fall in from the top like that and they
all line up very nicely in the proper

112
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,049
all line up very nicely in the proper
 

113
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,949
all line up very nicely in the proper
order which is really important because

114
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
order which is really important because

be really annoying so yeah it seems to

124
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:44,670
be really annoying so yeah it seems to
 

125
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,300
be really annoying so yeah it seems to
work pretty good this design is a

126
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,310
work pretty good this design is a
 

127
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,910
work pretty good this design is a
totally modular - I can add as many of

128
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
totally modular - I can add as many of
 

129
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,020
totally modular - I can add as many of
these columns as I want or no no no

these columns as I want or no no no
 

131
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,130
these columns as I want or no no no
these are these are rows right wait I'm

132
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,140
these are these are rows right wait I'm
 

133
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,940
these are these are rows right wait I'm
gonna mess this up this is a row this is

134
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:01,950
gonna mess this up this is a row this is
 

135
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,839
gonna mess this up this is a row this is
a column so I can have as many either

136
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:05,849
a column so I can have as many either
 

137
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,610
a column so I can have as many either
way I can have as make columns or rows

138
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:07,620
way I can have as make columns or rows
 

139
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,819
way I can have as make columns or rows
as I want with this I'm not gonna

140
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:09,829
as I want with this I'm not gonna
 

141
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,240
as I want with this I'm not gonna
overanalyze that the way the redstone

142
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,250
overanalyze that the way the redstone
 

143
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,130
overanalyze that the way the redstone
and all the the tracks are set up it's

144
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,140
and all the the tracks are set up it's
 

145
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,710
and all the the tracks are set up it's
it's expandable you have as many or as

146
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
it's expandable you have as many or as
 

147
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,930
it's expandable you have as many or as
little carts as you want with it and I

148
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:20,940
little carts as you want with it and I
 

149
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,379
little carts as you want with it and I
got it nicely compact here I'm really

150
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:24,389
got it nicely compact here I'm really
 

151
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,150
got it nicely compact here I'm really
really happy with how I did the redstone

152
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,160
really happy with how I did the redstone
 

153
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,909
really happy with how I did the redstone
so let's let's do it again you can see

154
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:31,919
so let's let's do it again you can see
 

155
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,819
so let's let's do it again you can see
it goes over a detector rail over here

156
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:33,829
it goes over a detector rail over here
 

157
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,289
it goes over a detector rail over here
when it goes over the detector rail it

158
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:36,299
when it goes over the detector rail it
 

159
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,470
when it goes over the detector rail it
tells this thing to trigger again and

160
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,480
tells this thing to trigger again and
 

161
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,210
tells this thing to trigger again and
you see it trigger there but there's no

162
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,220
you see it trigger there but there's no
 

163
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,460
you see it trigger there but there's no
carts in it so that's what stops it from

164
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,470
carts in it so that's what stops it from
 

165
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,930
carts in it so that's what stops it from
looping over and over so that would be

166
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:47,940
looping over and over so that would be
 

167
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,449
looping over and over so that would be
column you can have any any amount in

168
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:50,459
column you can have any any amount in
 

169
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,979
column you can have any any amount in
the column you want because of that

170
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:51,989
the column you want because of that
 

171
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,530
the column you want because of that
because it'll keep running until there's

172
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,540
because it'll keep running until there's
 

173
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,920
because it'll keep running until there's
no more minecarts left basically and

174
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:57,930
no more minecarts left basically and
 

175
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,449
no more minecarts left basically and
then let's get it going again we will

176
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,459
then let's get it going again we will
 

177
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,680
then let's get it going again we will
focus on the row sorting so it comes

178
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,690
focus on the row sorting so it comes

Junction it's slurring my words like

186
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,389
Junction it's slurring my words like
 

187
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,469

that they all split and go into their

190
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,010
that they all split and go into their
 

191
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,750
that they all split and go into their
proper column so that's cool and the way

192
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:26,760
proper column so that's cool and the way
 

193
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,800
proper column so that's cool and the way
that is

194
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,810
that is
 

195
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,600
that is
I figured it easier just to show you

196
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:29,610
I figured it easier just to show you
 

197
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,780
I figured it easier just to show you
here than doing in the LP world and in

198
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:32,790
here than doing in the LP world and in
 

199
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,909
here than doing in the LP world and in
the LP world we're gonna be focusing on

200
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:34,919
the LP world we're gonna be focusing on
 

201
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,770
the LP world we're gonna be focusing on
making the stations work together which

202
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:36,780
making the stations work together which
 

203
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
making the stations work together which
I don't have set up here we have to

204
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:38,790
I don't have set up here we have to
 

205
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,350
I don't have set up here we have to
figure that out yet alright so when it

206
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
figure that out yet alright so when it
 

207
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,700
figure that out yet alright so when it
goes over this sends up depending on the

208
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:49,710
goes over this sends up depending on the
 

209
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,490
goes over this sends up depending on the
length of this current you can adjust

210
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:52,500
length of this current you can adjust
 

211
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,970
length of this current you can adjust
this to add more columns and if you want

212
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:54,980
this to add more columns and if you want
 

213
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,150
this to add more columns and if you want
but it goes starts here triggers this

214
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,160
but it goes starts here triggers this
 

215
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,100
but it goes starts here triggers this
Junction first two ticks later triggers

216
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,110
Junction first two ticks later triggers
 

217
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,560
Junction first two ticks later triggers
this one and this one and this one and

218
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,570
this one and this one and this one and
 

219
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,110
this one and this one and this one and
that's how it breaks them up like that

220
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,120
that's how it breaks them up like that
 

221
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,420
that's how it breaks them up like that
and these Pistons trigger two ticks of

222
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,430
and these Pistons trigger two ticks of
 

223
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,980
and these Pistons trigger two ticks of
part two so they're in sync with each

224
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:09,990
part two so they're in sync with each
 

225
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,300
part two so they're in sync with each
other down here so that is pretty cool

226
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,310

 

227
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,950

so there are a couple issues with this

228
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
so there are a couple issues with this
 

229
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,570
so there are a couple issues with this
I'm gonna point out just with the way

230
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:20,580
I'm gonna point out just with the way
 

231
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,110
I'm gonna point out just with the way

separating them I'm not gonna deal with

242
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,080
separating them I'm not gonna deal with
 

243
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,909
separating them I'm not gonna deal with
that with my setup so if you plan on

244
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:40,919
that with my setup so if you plan on
 

245
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,890
that with my setup so if you plan on
doing it you're gonna have to come up

246
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:42,900
doing it you're gonna have to come up
 

247
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,779
doing it you're gonna have to come up
with a way of separating them afterwards

248
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:44,789
with a way of separating them afterwards
 

249
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,270
with a way of separating them afterwards
which I may look into eventually but not

250
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
which I may look into eventually but not
 

251
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,420
which I may look into eventually but not
not with what I'm doing here second

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,430
not with what I'm doing here second

minecarts both have a visual glitch like

256
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:01,770
minecarts both have a visual glitch like
 

257
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,320
minecarts both have a visual glitch like
they're being is shown down here they're

258
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,330
they're being is shown down here they're
 

259
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,469
they're being is shown down here they're
not actually down there they're there in

260
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
not actually down there they're there in
 

261
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,150
not actually down there they're there in
the same spot as these minecarts

262
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
the same spot as these minecarts
 

263
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,390
the same spot as these minecarts
basically so there's a visual glitch and

264
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,400
basically so there's a visual glitch and
 

265
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,060
basically so there's a visual glitch and
they also will will fall down into the

266
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,070
they also will will fall down into the
 

267
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,010
they also will will fall down into the
other minecart below so they're merged

268
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,020
other minecart below so they're merged
 

269
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,190
other minecart below so they're merged
together actually thankfully though they

270
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,200
together actually thankfully though they
 

271
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,590
together actually thankfully though they
seem to separate themselves properly

272
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,600
seem to separate themselves properly
 

273
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,760
seem to separate themselves properly
see when they're riding they're

274
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:23,770
see when they're riding they're

Heather's two together now and when they

276
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:28,750
Heather's two together now and when they
 

277
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,990
Heather's two together now and when they
fall down they should all work out okay

278
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,000
fall down they should all work out okay
 

279
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,420
fall down they should all work out okay
a little bit of a visual glitch going on

280
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,430
a little bit of a visual glitch going on
 

281
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,180
a little bit of a visual glitch going on
still I think but yeah we had seeds in

282
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,190
still I think but yeah we had seeds in
 

283
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,770
still I think but yeah we had seeds in
the bottom that in the top before and

284
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:40,780
the bottom that in the top before and
 

285
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,700
the bottom that in the top before and
now it's it's worked out properly even

286
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:44,710
now it's it's worked out properly even
 

287
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,910
now it's it's worked out properly even
if it doesn't look like it it is it just

288
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:47,920
if it doesn't look like it it is it just
 

289
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,410
if it doesn't look like it it is it just
takes a little while for it to resync

290
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:49,420
takes a little while for it to resync
 

291
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,670
takes a little while for it to resync
when you log back in and that's yeah

292
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
when you log back in and that's yeah
 

293
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
when you log back in and that's yeah
that ones down here even though it's

294
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:55,690
that ones down here even though it's
 

295
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,660
that ones down here even though it's
there all right cool so we have our plan

296
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:00,670
there all right cool so we have our plan
 

297
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,780
there all right cool so we have our plan
figured out I know what we got to do I'm

298
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:03,790
figured out I know what we got to do I'm
 

299
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,340
figured out I know what we got to do I'm
gonna start a building now we're in our

300
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,350
gonna start a building now we're in our
 

301
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,760
gonna start a building now we're in our
LP world finally seven minutes in what

302
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,770
LP world finally seven minutes in what
 

303
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,370
LP world finally seven minutes in what
is going on here but there was a lot to

304
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,380
is going on here but there was a lot to
 

305
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,470
is going on here but there was a lot to
show and I actually forgot to show a few

306
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,480
show and I actually forgot to show a few
 

307
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,820
show and I actually forgot to show a few
things but I want to try set up three of

308
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:17,830
things but I want to try set up three of
 

309
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,270
things but I want to try set up three of
those today three of them is enough to

310
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,280
those today three of them is enough to
 

311
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,190
those today three of them is enough to
show it working and demonstrate the idea

312
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,200
show it working and demonstrate the idea
 

313
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,170
show it working and demonstrate the idea
later as I feel I need more around the

314
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,180
later as I feel I need more around the
 

315
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,120
later as I feel I need more around the
area I will build a more and then it

316
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,130
area I will build a more and then it
 

317
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,590
area I will build a more and then it
shouldn't be pretty easy to connect them

318
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:31,600
shouldn't be pretty easy to connect them
 

319
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,430
shouldn't be pretty easy to connect them
together I would say so I want I think I

320
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
together I would say so I want I think I
 

321
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
together I would say so I want I think I
want one up here in this area I like

322
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:37,690
want one up here in this area I like
 

323
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,390
want one up here in this area I like
this area quite a bit you got this cool

324
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,400
this area quite a bit you got this cool
 

325
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,320
this area quite a bit you got this cool
view over here there's like a pathway

326
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,330
view over here there's like a pathway
 

327
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,680
view over here there's like a pathway
that way and I especially like this side

328
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:46,690
that way and I especially like this side
 

329
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,350
that way and I especially like this side
because we have the lake below and I

330
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
because we have the lake below and I
 

331
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,140
because we have the lake below and I
want to do some stuff with this lake and

332
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,150
want to do some stuff with this lake and
 

333
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,300
want to do some stuff with this lake and
then you have this amazing overhang that

334
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,310
then you have this amazing overhang that
 

335
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,640
then you have this amazing overhang that
runs for a long long ways in the

336
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,650
runs for a long long ways in the
 

337
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,920
runs for a long long ways in the
darkness that I want to do something

338
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:58,930
darkness that I want to do something
 

339
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,140
darkness that I want to do something
with do eventually

340
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,150
with do eventually
 

341
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,040
with do eventually
so we'll put one maybe against this wall

342
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,050
so we'll put one maybe against this wall
 

343
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,250
so we'll put one maybe against this wall
all right it's getting late time I think

344
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,260
all right it's getting late time I think
 

345
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,410
all right it's getting late time I think
I'm gonna put another one at the top of

346
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm gonna put another one at the top of
 

347
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm gonna put another one at the top of
our jump pad area here let's see if we

348
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
our jump pad area here let's see if we
 

349
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,970
our jump pad area here let's see if we
can do this again today oh man

350
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:16,980
can do this again today oh man
 

351
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,130
can do this again today oh man
it's actually pretty challenging well I

352
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,140
it's actually pretty challenging well I
 

353
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,200
it's actually pretty challenging well I
pause there for a second I was thinking

354
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,210
pause there for a second I was thinking
 

355
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,080
pause there for a second I was thinking
maybe here but I'm not sure yet this is

356
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,090
maybe here but I'm not sure yet this is
 

357
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,280
maybe here but I'm not sure yet this is
probably too close to the other one

358
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,290
probably too close to the other one
 

359
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,610
probably too close to the other one
we're building all right so let's go up

360
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:29,620
we're building all right so let's go up
 

361
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,180
we're building all right so let's go up
further

362
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,190

 

363
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,790

and I think at the very top I was

364
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
and I think at the very top I was
 

365
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,110
and I think at the very top I was
planning not here a little bit further

366
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120

 

367
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,819

never gets old I love that in this area

368
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:46,829
never gets old I love that in this area
 

369
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:48,980
never gets old I love that in this area
maybe against that wall we'll have

370
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:48,990
maybe against that wall we'll have
 

371
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,350
maybe against that wall we'll have
another one the issue with this area

372
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
another one the issue with this area
 

373
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,679
another one the issue with this area
though is there's so much darkness up

374
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:54,689
though is there's so much darkness up
 

375
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:56,720
though is there's so much darkness up
there in the mobs dislike trail down the

376
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,730
there in the mobs dislike trail down the
 

377
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,699
there in the mobs dislike trail down the
mountain I'm worried it's gonna get

378
00:08:58,699 --> 00:08:58,709
mountain I'm worried it's gonna get
 

379
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,900
mountain I'm worried it's gonna get
blown up if I build something here this

380
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:02,910
blown up if I build something here this
 

381
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,249
blown up if I build something here this
would be a good spot though because this

382
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:04,259
would be a good spot though because this
 

383
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,639
would be a good spot though because this
is up high and we could if we're ever

384
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:07,649
is up high and we could if we're ever
 

385
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,900
is up high and we could if we're ever
building something at the top of the

386
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:08,910
building something at the top of the
 

387
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,340
building something at the top of the
mountain area this would be a good

388
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,350
mountain area this would be a good
 

389
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,389
mountain area this would be a good
storage room location and I'm not sure

390
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
storage room location and I'm not sure
 

391
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,590
storage room location and I'm not sure
where I'm putting another one yet I'm

392
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
where I'm putting another one yet I'm
 

393
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,869
where I'm putting another one yet I'm
gonna look around but I will get to it

394
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:17,879
gonna look around but I will get to it
 

395
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,300
gonna look around but I will get to it
here and I will teach you up probably in

396
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,310
here and I will teach you up probably in
 

397
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,689
here and I will teach you up probably in
a hour too when I get it all done so be

398
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:23,699
a hour too when I get it all done so be
 

399
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:29,059
a hour too when I get it all done so be
right back and we are back guys we are

400
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:29,069
right back and we are back guys we are
 

401
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,240
right back and we are back guys we are
back I got three of those stations set

402
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,250
back I got three of those stations set
 

403
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,179
back I got three of those stations set
up all wired and redstone Depp which is

404
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:35,189
up all wired and redstone Depp which is
 

405
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:35,809
up all wired and redstone Depp which is
cool

406
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:35,819
cool
 

407
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,679
cool
we're gonna start testing them out now

408
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:38,689
we're gonna start testing them out now
 

409
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,970
we're gonna start testing them out now
this is like three or four hours later

410
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:40,980
this is like three or four hours later
 

411
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,699
this is like three or four hours later
big surprise this is gonna take a lot

412
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:43,709
big surprise this is gonna take a lot
 

413
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,269
big surprise this is gonna take a lot
longer than I initially expected setting

414
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
longer than I initially expected setting
 

415
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,800
longer than I initially expected setting
up the stations did only take like an

416
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:48,810
up the stations did only take like an
 

417
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,050
up the stations did only take like an
hour too but I'm starting to run the

418
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,060
hour too but I'm starting to run the
 

419
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,960
hour too but I'm starting to run the
tracks between the stations and this

420
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:53,970
tracks between the stations and this
 

421
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,900
tracks between the stations and this
place is huge like seriously I have to

422
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:56,910
place is huge like seriously I have to
 

423
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,079
place is huge like seriously I have to
run the tracks so far it's yeah this is

424
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:03,089
run the tracks so far it's yeah this is
 

425
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,829
run the tracks so far it's yeah this is
not a small project anyway we're gonna

426
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:06,839
not a small project anyway we're gonna
 

427
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,540
not a small project anyway we're gonna
go test this out so let's see yeah yeah

428
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,550
go test this out so let's see yeah yeah
 

429
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,920
go test this out so let's see yeah yeah
where do I get a jump down I think we

430
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:15,930
where do I get a jump down I think we
 

431
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,540
where do I get a jump down I think we
should aim for yeah I think let's aim

432
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:17,550
should aim for yeah I think let's aim
 

433
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,699
should aim for yeah I think let's aim
for over there for this test I want to

434
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:19,709
for over there for this test I want to
 

435
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,410
for over there for this test I want to
see if it keeps the train formation as

436
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:21,420
see if it keeps the train formation as
 

437
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,870
see if it keeps the train formation as
it runs our path here so it's basically

438
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:23,880
it runs our path here so it's basically
 

439
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,679
it runs our path here so it's basically
gonna go down this thing and then dead

440
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:27,689
gonna go down this thing and then dead
 

441
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,530
gonna go down this thing and then dead
ends and then it falls a long long ways

442
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
ends and then it falls a long long ways
 

443
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,259
ends and then it falls a long long ways
and I'm hoping it looks cool as it falls

444
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:33,269
and I'm hoping it looks cool as it falls
 

445
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,540
and I'm hoping it looks cool as it falls
so that's sort of what I'm going for and

446
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:35,550
so that's sort of what I'm going for and
 

447
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,699
so that's sort of what I'm going for and
we got to make sure the carts don't

448
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:37,709
we got to make sure the carts don't
 

449
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,650
we got to make sure the carts don't
merge in on each other as it does this

450
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
merge in on each other as it does this
 

451
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,740
merge in on each other as it does this
if they do we have to change this up

452
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:42,750
if they do we have to change this up
 

453
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,830
if they do we have to change this up
quite a bit all right

454
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:45,840
quite a bit all right
 

455
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,460
quite a bit all right
here we go run don't miss it

456
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,470
here we go run don't miss it
 

457
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,980
here we go run don't miss it
don't miss it how have I not died yet I

458
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:51,990
don't miss it how have I not died yet I
 

459
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,260
don't miss it how have I not died yet I
don't know I've had so many close calls

460
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,270
don't know I've had so many close calls
 

461
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,850
don't know I've had so many close calls
out here they come yeah that looked good

462
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:58,860
out here they come yeah that looked good
 

463
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,270
out here they come yeah that looked good
actually

464
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,280
actually
 

465
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,290
actually
that was good there they go oh man just

466
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,300
that was good there they go oh man just
 

467
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,180
that was good there they go oh man just
to go from one station to the other one

468
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,190
to go from one station to the other one
 

469
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,490
to go from one station to the other one
this is the track we got running right

470
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,500
this is the track we got running right
 

471
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,370
this is the track we got running right
now I have to definitely make sure no

472
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,380
now I have to definitely make sure no
 

473
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,890
now I have to definitely make sure no
mobs can spawn in this stuff or go on

474
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:15,900
mobs can spawn in this stuff or go on
 

475
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,730
mobs can spawn in this stuff or go on
the tracks otherwise all the contents

476
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:19,740
the tracks otherwise all the contents
 

477
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,500
the tracks otherwise all the contents
and the minecarts are gonna get mixed up

478
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,510
and the minecarts are gonna get mixed up
 

479
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,340
and the minecarts are gonna get mixed up
and messed up

480
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,350
and messed up
 

481
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,350
and messed up
oh no no why did it not work oh they all

482
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
oh no no why did it not work oh they all
 

483
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,320
oh no no why did it not work oh they all
went to the first one ah man all except

484
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,330
went to the first one ah man all except
 

485
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,720
went to the first one ah man all except
for one this one went to the proper spot

486
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:35,730
for one this one went to the proper spot
 

487
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,460
for one this one went to the proper spot
I'm guessing I may have some timings

488
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:40,470
I'm guessing I may have some timings
 

489
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,750
I'm guessing I may have some timings
wrong this is where we put that second

490
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
wrong this is where we put that second
 

491
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,960
wrong this is where we put that second
one by the way I just put in this wall I

492
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:47,970
one by the way I just put in this wall I
 

493
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,800
one by the way I just put in this wall I
may move this cart rail so it hangs

494
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:51,810
may move this cart rail so it hangs
 

495
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,570
may move this cart rail so it hangs
underneath there instead of going

496
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:53,580
underneath there instead of going
 

497
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,860
underneath there instead of going
through the mountain like I have it

498
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:54,870
through the mountain like I have it
 

499
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,650
through the mountain like I have it
currently what it's doing actually is

500
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
currently what it's doing actually is
 

501
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,830
currently what it's doing actually is
kind of cool it goes and probably see it

502
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:00,840
kind of cool it goes and probably see it
 

503
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,250
kind of cool it goes and probably see it
better over here it's pretty complicated

504
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,260
better over here it's pretty complicated
 

505
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,280
better over here it's pretty complicated
to run the track through this this kind

506
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,290
to run the track through this this kind
 

507
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,360
to run the track through this this kind
of terrain actually see just go up and

508
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,370
of terrain actually see just go up and
 

509
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,750
of terrain actually see just go up and
over here

510
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
over here
 

511
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,580
over here
alright so it this is overhanging the

512
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,590
alright so it this is overhanging the
 

513
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,310
alright so it this is overhanging the
same overhang you can see actually I

514
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,320
same overhang you can see actually I
 

515
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,530
same overhang you can see actually I
didn't do a good job of it this line is

516
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,540
didn't do a good job of it this line is
 

517
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,910
didn't do a good job of it this line is
that's where the track is it's right on

518
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
that's where the track is it's right on
 

519
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,760
that's where the track is it's right on
top of those blocks so it comes out this

520
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:28,770
top of those blocks so it comes out this
 

521
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,670
top of those blocks so it comes out this
way takes it right goes down this way

522
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
way takes it right goes down this way
 

523
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,250
way takes it right goes down this way
through the mountain and then up and

524
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,260
through the mountain and then up and
 

525
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,440
through the mountain and then up and
around somehow yeah and then it falls

526
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,450
around somehow yeah and then it falls
 

527
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,230
around somehow yeah and then it falls
from there so that is the first stretch

528
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
from there so that is the first stretch
 

529
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,030
from there so that is the first stretch
of our journey I gotta try figure out

530
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
of our journey I gotta try figure out
 

531
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,160
of our journey I gotta try figure out
why this did not keep the right timing

532
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,170
why this did not keep the right timing
 

533
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,800
why this did not keep the right timing
no so I will be right back aha so I got

534
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:51,810
no so I will be right back aha so I got
 

535
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,900
no so I will be right back aha so I got
the problem figured out here hopefully

536
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:53,910
the problem figured out here hopefully
 

537
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,180
the problem figured out here hopefully
it's not too big of a problem to fix it

538
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,190
it's not too big of a problem to fix it
 

539
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,310
it's not too big of a problem to fix it
this is why I didn't just do a tutorial

540
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
this is why I didn't just do a tutorial
 

541
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,610
this is why I didn't just do a tutorial
by the way I want to

542
00:12:59,610 --> 00:12:59,620
by the way I want to
 

543
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,860
by the way I want to
I want to like test this thing out for

544
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:01,870
I want to like test this thing out for
 

545
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,019
I want to like test this thing out for
reals and make sure it works the way I

546
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:04,029
reals and make sure it works the way I
 

547
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,050
reals and make sure it works the way I
hope it does because if this thing is a

548
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,060
hope it does because if this thing is a
 

549
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,519
hope it does because if this thing is a
major flop that would be a big waste of

550
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,529
major flop that would be a big waste of
 

551
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:18,210
major flop that would be a big waste of
time for everybody so the issue is these

552
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:18,220
time for everybody so the issue is these
 

553
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,579
time for everybody so the issue is these
junctions normally when I set it up

554
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:20,589
junctions normally when I set it up
 

555
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,800
junctions normally when I set it up
originally they defaulted to face to the

556
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,810
originally they defaulted to face to the
 

557
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,200
originally they defaulted to face to the
right now they're facing to the left so

558
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,210
right now they're facing to the left so
 

559
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,420
right now they're facing to the left so
it's opposite because it's a different

560
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:27,430
it's opposite because it's a different
 

561
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,190
it's opposite because it's a different
direction we're facing so I'm hoping I

562
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,200
direction we're facing so I'm hoping I
 

563
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,910
direction we're facing so I'm hoping I
can just let's see let's get us a

564
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
can just let's see let's get us a
 

565
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,180
can just let's see let's get us a
redstone torch going here and invert the

566
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,190
redstone torch going here and invert the
 

567
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,100
redstone torch going here and invert the
thing and then this will just change the

568
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,110
thing and then this will just change the
 

569
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,640
thing and then this will just change the
delay a little bit yeah I think that'll

570
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,650
delay a little bit yeah I think that'll
 

571
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,420
delay a little bit yeah I think that'll
work yeah let's just put this on top all

572
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,430
work yeah let's just put this on top all
 

573
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,860
work yeah let's just put this on top all
right so now that torch adds a tick of

574
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:55,870
right so now that torch adds a tick of
 

575
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,820
right so now that torch adds a tick of
delay so let's decrease this and these

576
00:13:59,820 --> 00:13:59,830
delay so let's decrease this and these
 

577
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,550
delay so let's decrease this and these
defaults to the proper direction now I

578
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
defaults to the proper direction now I
 

579
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,560
defaults to the proper direction now I
believe yeah so next time we run this it

580
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,570
believe yeah so next time we run this it
 

581
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,160
believe yeah so next time we run this it
should work yeah goes all the way to the

582
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,170
should work yeah goes all the way to the
 

583
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,320
should work yeah goes all the way to the
end cool all right I'm gonna run it

584
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,330
end cool all right I'm gonna run it
 

585
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,800
end cool all right I'm gonna run it
again let's see what happens I'm

586
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:19,810
again let's see what happens I'm
 

587
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,079
again let's see what happens I'm
noticing our first one here is incorrect

588
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,089
noticing our first one here is incorrect
 

589
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,820
noticing our first one here is incorrect
as well so I'll have to change it if

590
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:23,830
as well so I'll have to change it if
 

591
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,070
as well so I'll have to change it if
this works let me show you how I'm

592
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,080
this works let me show you how I'm
 

593
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,170
this works let me show you how I'm
loading them and just basically dropping

594
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,180
loading them and just basically dropping
 

595
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,829
loading them and just basically dropping
in from from here pretty easy seems to

596
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
in from from here pretty easy seems to
 

597
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,300
in from from here pretty easy seems to
go in the right place always all right

598
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,310
go in the right place always all right
 

599
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,520
go in the right place always all right
cool let's try it out I know this is a

600
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,530
cool let's try it out I know this is a
 

601
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,010
cool let's try it out I know this is a
lot of work this is more work than just

602
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,020
lot of work this is more work than just
 

603
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,380
lot of work this is more work than just
running back and forth ever will be but

604
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,390
running back and forth ever will be but
 

605
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,240
running back and forth ever will be but
that's this is what makes Minecraft fun

606
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,250
that's this is what makes Minecraft fun
 

607
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,190
that's this is what makes Minecraft fun
is doing stuff like this oh no you don't

608
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,200
is doing stuff like this oh no you don't
 

609
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,860
is doing stuff like this oh no you don't
not gonna happen

610
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:54,870
not gonna happen
 

611
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,590
not gonna happen
all right and it is nighttime and

612
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:58,600
all right and it is nighttime and
 

613
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,420
all right and it is nighttime and
raining maybe I'll cut one more time in

614
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,430
raining maybe I'll cut one more time in
 

615
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,190
raining maybe I'll cut one more time in
and pass the time oh yeah and this time

616
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,200
and pass the time oh yeah and this time
 

617
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,079
and pass the time oh yeah and this time
I put some items in the chest so we can

618
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:07,089
I put some items in the chest so we can
 

619
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,579
I put some items in the chest so we can
make sure they go in the right order so

620
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:08,589
make sure they go in the right order so
 

621
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,590
make sure they go in the right order so
from the left to the right we got stone

622
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:10,600
from the left to the right we got stone
 

623
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,900
from the left to the right we got stone
redstone grass

624
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:12,910
redstone grass
 

625
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,300
redstone grass
cobblestone and coal so they should end

626
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,310
cobblestone and coal so they should end
 

627
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,100
cobblestone and coal so they should end
up that way at the station down there

628
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,110
up that way at the station down there
 

629
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,629
up that way at the station down there
too if they go in the proper order all

630
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:21,639
too if they go in the proper order all
 

631
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,110
too if they go in the proper order all
right let's go try beat it there if we

632
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
right let's go try beat it there if we
 

633
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:34,050
right let's go try beat it there if we
can we gotta go or this way and oh man I

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,180
can we gotta go or this way and oh man I
get so turned around yeah I think we're

636
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,190
get so turned around yeah I think we're
 

637
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,230
get so turned around yeah I think we're
in the right spot I think it's just

638
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,240
in the right spot I think it's just
 

639
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,160
in the right spot I think it's just
right there oh that could have been bad

640
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,170
right there oh that could have been bad
 

641
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,970
right there oh that could have been bad
I am totally lost now we are not gonna

642
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:44,980
I am totally lost now we are not gonna
 

643
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,210
I am totally lost now we are not gonna
beat it Oh feel into Pearl feel ender

644
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,220
beat it Oh feel into Pearl feel ender
 

645
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:59,550
beat it Oh feel into Pearl feel ender
pearl okay well I made such an effort to

646
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,560
pearl okay well I made such an effort to
 

647
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,230
pearl okay well I made such an effort to
get there early oh come on there we go

648
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240

 

649
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,120

today okay they're here they are a

650
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,130
today okay they're here they are a
 

651
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,860
today okay they're here they are a
little out of place aren't they what is

652
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:13,870
little out of place aren't they what is
 

653
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,600
little out of place aren't they what is
up with that stone red stone grass

654
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,610
up with that stone red stone grass
 

655
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,490
up with that stone red stone grass
cobblestone and coal whoo-hoo

656
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,500
cobblestone and coal whoo-hoo
 

657
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,829
cobblestone and coal whoo-hoo
that's right order but they move forward

658
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:22,839
that's right order but they move forward
 

659
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,100
that's right order but they move forward
a little bit unless it's a visual thing

660
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,110
a little bit unless it's a visual thing
 

661
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,730
a little bit unless it's a visual thing
I think they didn't move forward though

662
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:28,740
I think they didn't move forward though
 

663
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,670
I think they didn't move forward though
although I can't bump them oh oh I think

664
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
although I can't bump them oh oh I think
 

665
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,910
although I can't bump them oh oh I think
it oh yeah they were in the right spot

666
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
it oh yeah they were in the right spot
 

667
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,740
it oh yeah they were in the right spot
uh-huh so they desynch like boats do

668
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:40,750
uh-huh so they desynch like boats do
 

669
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,170
uh-huh so they desynch like boats do
visually and it can really make things

670
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,180
visually and it can really make things
 

671
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,569
visually and it can really make things
hard to figure out sometimes I think

672
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:45,579
hard to figure out sometimes I think
 

673
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,569
hard to figure out sometimes I think
they are in the right spot actually okay

674
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:48,579
they are in the right spot actually okay
 

675
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:54,809
they are in the right spot actually okay
good all right guys so we have maybe 10

676
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:54,819
good all right guys so we have maybe 10
 

677
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,429
good all right guys so we have maybe 10
minutes left this episode and I've

678
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:56,439
minutes left this episode and I've
 

679
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,710
minutes left this episode and I've
decided we will go do a project at the

680
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
decided we will go do a project at the
 

681
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,410
decided we will go do a project at the
manty because we've been we've been

682
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:01,420
manty because we've been we've been
 

683
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,120
manty because we've been we've been
really focusing on this area I want to

684
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,130
really focusing on this area I want to
 

685
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,740
really focusing on this area I want to
get a good start to it right but I don't

686
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:04,750
get a good start to it right but I don't
 

687
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,419
get a good start to it right but I don't
want to give you guys an impression we

688
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:06,429
want to give you guys an impression we
 

689
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,929
want to give you guys an impression we
left the man cave behind and honestly

690
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:09,939
left the man cave behind and honestly
 

691
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,720
left the man cave behind and honestly
I'm sick of digging rail lines today so

692
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:12,730
I'm sick of digging rail lines today so
 

693
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,990
I'm sick of digging rail lines today so
I don't want to do any more here anyway

694
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't want to do any more here anyway
 

695
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,520
I don't want to do any more here anyway
but before we go I'm going to tell you a

696
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,530
but before we go I'm going to tell you a
 

697
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,529
but before we go I'm going to tell you a
little more on the plan with this thing

698
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:19,539
little more on the plan with this thing
 

699
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,539
little more on the plan with this thing
because as it is it's not set up

700
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:21,549
because as it is it's not set up
 

701
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:24,780
because as it is it's not set up
correctly I don't actually want this

702
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:24,790
correctly I don't actually want this
 

703
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,510
correctly I don't actually want this
rail line to come

704
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,520
rail line to come
 

705
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,390
rail line to come
- this thing I want it to run beside it

706
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,400
- this thing I want it to run beside it
 

707
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,360
- this thing I want it to run beside it
right and only if the carts are supposed

708
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,370
right and only if the carts are supposed
 

709
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,240
right and only if the carts are supposed
to go here then there will be a junction

710
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,250
to go here then there will be a junction
 

711
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,980
to go here then there will be a junction
that triggers and then the carts can go

712
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:36,990
that triggers and then the carts can go
 

713
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,810
that triggers and then the carts can go
into the station if they're supposed to

714
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:40,820
into the station if they're supposed to
 

715
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,790
into the station if they're supposed to
his idea is not that they go to the next

716
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:43,800
his idea is not that they go to the next
 

717
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,380
his idea is not that they go to the next
station down the line they go to the

718
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,390
station down the line they go to the
 

719
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,630
station down the line they go to the
station that's calling them which could

720
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:47,640
station that's calling them which could
 

721
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,510
station that's calling them which could
be any of them so when I hit a button

722
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:50,520
be any of them so when I hit a button
 

723
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,460
be any of them so when I hit a button
here it's gonna trigger a t flip-flop

724
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,470
here it's gonna trigger a t flip-flop
 

725
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,740
here it's gonna trigger a t flip-flop
which will convert a junction to let the

726
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:54,750
which will convert a junction to let the
 

727
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,900
which will convert a junction to let the
carts go to the station I I hit the

728
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:56,910
carts go to the station I I hit the
 

729
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,600
carts go to the station I I hit the
button at right you still following me

730
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,610

 

731
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,670

it also has to tell the other stations

732
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:04,680
it also has to tell the other stations
 

733
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,010
it also has to tell the other stations
that they should try release their carts

734
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,020
that they should try release their carts
 

735
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,620
that they should try release their carts
and the station that has the carts it'll

736
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,630
and the station that has the carts it'll
 

737
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,170
and the station that has the carts it'll
it'll send them down into a loop will

738
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,180
it'll send them down into a loop will
 

739
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,790
it'll send them down into a loop will
make a loop between all the stations to

740
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:16,800
make a loop between all the stations to
 

741
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,340
make a loop between all the stations to
actually call the carts I think the best

742
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,350
actually call the carts I think the best
 

743
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,130
actually call the carts I think the best
way is going to be to send a cart down

744
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,140
way is going to be to send a cart down
 

745
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,220
way is going to be to send a cart down
the rail line because we have a rail

746
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,230
the rail line because we have a rail
 

747
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,810
the rail line because we have a rail
line set instead of running a red

748
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:26,820
line set instead of running a red
 

749
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,760
line set instead of running a red
redstone signal to all the stations

750
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:28,770
redstone signal to all the stations
 

751
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,060
redstone signal to all the stations
we'll use the track we have send a cart

752
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,070
we'll use the track we have send a cart
 

753
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,010
we'll use the track we have send a cart
down and as it passes by each of the

754
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,020
down and as it passes by each of the
 

755
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,030
down and as it passes by each of the
stations it's gonna do the same as it's

756
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,040
stations it's gonna do the same as it's
 

757
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,750
stations it's gonna do the same as it's
basically pressing this button here if

758
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
basically pressing this button here if
 

759
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,700
basically pressing this button here if
there's carts at that station it will

760
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:43,710
there's carts at that station it will
 

761
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,500
there's carts at that station it will
release them down the track if there's

762
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,510
release them down the track if there's
 

763
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,470
release them down the track if there's
nothing it won't do anything

764
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:47,480
nothing it won't do anything
 

765
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,880
nothing it won't do anything
so the carts will go down the loop and

766
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:49,890
so the carts will go down the loop and
 

767
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,440
so the carts will go down the loop and
then they'll go to the station that has

768
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,450
then they'll go to the station that has
 

769
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:58,520
then they'll go to the station that has
the D flip-flop set oh stop stop take it

770
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,530
the D flip-flop set oh stop stop take it
 

771
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,080
the D flip-flop set oh stop stop take it
back oh I'm destroying everything oh man

772
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,090
back oh I'm destroying everything oh man
 

773
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,990
back oh I'm destroying everything oh man
I really wish you could stack carts like

774
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
I really wish you could stack carts like
 

775
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,970
I really wish you could stack carts like
really really wish that right about now

776
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:07,980
really really wish that right about now
 

777
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,480
really really wish that right about now
cuz these are not fun to move around it

778
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,490
cuz these are not fun to move around it
 

779
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,250
cuz these are not fun to move around it
is a pain oh I do have the chest okay

780
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,260
is a pain oh I do have the chest okay
 

781
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,370
is a pain oh I do have the chest okay
good um let me fix this I don't remember

782
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:22,380
good um let me fix this I don't remember
 

783
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,620
good um let me fix this I don't remember
how to fix it I think I had that there

784
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:24,630
how to fix it I think I had that there
 

785
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,670
how to fix it I think I had that there
and then no that's not right

786
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:30,680

 

787
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,610

all right all good all fixed the other
 

789
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,590
all right all good all fixed the other
station I built by the way I never did

790
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600

good way of dealing with that because

950
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:04,420
good way of dealing with that because
 

951
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,820
good way of dealing with that because
there's always that chance mobs are

952
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:06,830
there's always that chance mobs are
 

953
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,260
there's always that chance mobs are
gonna bump into each other on the way

954
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,270
gonna bump into each other on the way
 

955
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,750
gonna bump into each other on the way
down and they will they'll fall outside

956
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:10,760
down and they will they'll fall outside
 

957
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,690
down and they will they'll fall outside
and not land on the hoppers even if I

958
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:13,700
and not land on the hoppers even if I
 

959
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,020
and not land on the hoppers even if I
lowered the hoppers yeah so I think

960
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,030
lowered the hoppers yeah so I think
 

961
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,310
lowered the hoppers yeah so I think
we'll just have to leave it the way it

962
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
we'll just have to leave it the way it
 

963
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,710
we'll just have to leave it the way it
is

964
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:19,720
is
 

965
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,550
is
we'll do brick there and maybe another

966
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:23,560
we'll do brick there and maybe another
 

967
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,650
we'll do brick there and maybe another
thing works here like this and then we

968
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:29,660
thing works here like this and then we
 

969
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,630
thing works here like this and then we
would put a water stream here kind of

970
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:31,640
would put a water stream here kind of
 

971
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,910
would put a water stream here kind of
like what we do do out there the water

972
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:33,920
like what we do do out there the water
 

973
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,600
like what we do do out there the water
is in set one block and I don't know if

974
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,610
is in set one block and I don't know if
 

975
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,890
is in set one block and I don't know if
we can pull off this thing with the

976
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:38,900
we can pull off this thing with the
 

977
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,360
we can pull off this thing with the
stairs that we do around but that would

978
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,370
stairs that we do around but that would
 

979
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:46,180
stairs that we do around but that would
be cool we also need to sort of set up

980
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,190
be cool we also need to sort of set up
 

981
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,660
be cool we also need to sort of set up
some automatic sorting here so let's

982
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:49,670
some automatic sorting here so let's
 

983
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:55,290
some automatic sorting here so let's
plan to put a chest access in the middle

984
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:55,300
plan to put a chest access in the middle
 

985
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,350
plan to put a chest access in the middle
maybe we'll do it like this chest here I

986
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,360
maybe we'll do it like this chest here I
 

987
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,070
maybe we'll do it like this chest here I
want five total put maybe two over here

988
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,080
want five total put maybe two over here
 

989
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,990
want five total put maybe two over here
or these trap chests I don't want trap

990
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
or these trap chests I don't want trap
 

991
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,960
or these trap chests I don't want trap
chests wait a second let's get the

992
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:10,970
chests wait a second let's get the
 

993
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,430
chests wait a second let's get the
regular ones not that it really matters

994
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
regular ones not that it really matters
 

995
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,680
regular ones not that it really matters
that's just prefer using regular ones

996
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:17,690
that's just prefer using regular ones
 

997
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,300
that's just prefer using regular ones
when I did well actually we will need

998
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,310
when I did well actually we will need
 

999
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,470
when I did well actually we will need
yeah let's do that

1000
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,480
yeah let's do that
 

1001
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
yeah let's do that
I have a trap down there and a regular

1002
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:24,890
I have a trap down there and a regular
 

1003
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,670
I have a trap down there and a regular
one right next to it and then go over a

1004
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:27,680
one right next to it and then go over a
 

1005
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,680
one right next to it and then go over a
block this way do the same thing and

1006
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:32,690
block this way do the same thing and
 

1007
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,570
block this way do the same thing and
keep the pattern so trapped on the

1008
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,580
keep the pattern so trapped on the
 

1009
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,870
keep the pattern so trapped on the
outside not that it matters I just I

1010
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:37,880
outside not that it matters I just I
 

1011
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,850
outside not that it matters I just I
have this I want everything to be

1012
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:39,860
have this I want everything to be
 

1013
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,920
have this I want everything to be
symmetrical when I do it like this okay

1014
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:44,930
symmetrical when I do it like this okay
 

1015
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,560
symmetrical when I do it like this okay
so we will put bones and arrows in

1016
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:50,570
so we will put bones and arrows in
 

1017
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,020
so we will put bones and arrows in
maybe this side and we will put zombie

1018
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,030
maybe this side and we will put zombie
 

1019
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,220
maybe this side and we will put zombie
flesh and gunpowder in this one and then

1020
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,230
flesh and gunpowder in this one and then
 

1021
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,950
flesh and gunpowder in this one and then
we will put random other stuff in the

1022
00:25:59,950 --> 00:25:59,960
we will put random other stuff in the
 

1023
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,260
we will put random other stuff in the
middle one like like the sugar and the

1024
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,270
middle one like like the sugar and the
 

1025
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,840
middle one like like the sugar and the
glowstone and the bottles the drive

1026
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:04,850
glowstone and the bottles the drive
 

1027
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,390
glowstone and the bottles the drive
route route to that so maybe let me do a

1028
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
route route to that so maybe let me do a
 

1029
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,190
route route to that so maybe let me do a
little bit here we're not gonna get much

1030
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,200
little bit here we're not gonna get much
 

1031
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,770
little bit here we're not gonna get much
done but I'll try try to do a little bit

1032
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:16,780

 

1033
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,180

okay everyone so I didn't get much done

1034
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,190
okay everyone so I didn't get much done
 

1035
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,740
okay everyone so I didn't get much done
with the room here but I decided to

1036
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:20,750
with the room here but I decided to
 

1037
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,900
with the room here but I decided to
focus on getting the sorting system in

1038
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:22,910
focus on getting the sorting system in
 

1039
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,880
focus on getting the sorting system in
place so the floor is all ripped up

1040
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:24,890
place so the floor is all ripped up
 

1041
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,070
place so the floor is all ripped up
still and I'm gonna make it look nice a

1042
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,080
still and I'm gonna make it look nice a
 

1043
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,730
still and I'm gonna make it look nice a
little later but yeah all the items they

1044
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:30,740
little later but yeah all the items they
 

1045
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,670
little later but yeah all the items they
go down this hopper chain here towards

1046
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:33,680
go down this hopper chain here towards
 

1047
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,950
go down this hopper chain here towards
the end and as they pass through here

1048
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:35,960
the end and as they pass through here
 

1049
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,710
the end and as they pass through here
they end up sorted in these chests so

1050
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
they end up sorted in these chests so
 

1051
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
they end up sorted in these chests so
this one's for bones this one's for

1052
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:40,970
this one's for bones this one's for
 

1053
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,880
this one's for bones this one's for
arrows oh you did not just do that where

1054
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:45,890
arrows oh you did not just do that where
 

1055
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,790
arrows oh you did not just do that where
did you come from the middle one is

1056
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:48,800
did you come from the middle one is
 

1057
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,580
did you come from the middle one is
gunpowder because that's the most

1058
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:51,590
gunpowder because that's the most
 

1059
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,030
gunpowder because that's the most
important yeah zombie flesh and then

1060
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,040
important yeah zombie flesh and then
 

1061
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,430
important yeah zombie flesh and then
this is for random items that don't get

1062
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
this is for random items that don't get
 

1063
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,990
this is for random items that don't get
sorted in to anything else and it's a

1064
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
sorted in to anything else and it's a
 

1065
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,980
sorted in to anything else and it's a
pretty classic design basically

1066
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:04,990
pretty classic design basically
 

1067
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,440
pretty classic design basically
comparator wire goes down goes to a

1068
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,450
comparator wire goes down goes to a
 

1069
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,130
comparator wire goes down goes to a
repeater and then to a redstone torch up

1070
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,140
repeater and then to a redstone torch up
 

1071
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,470
repeater and then to a redstone torch up
to the hopper this one this hoppers

1072
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
to the hopper this one this hoppers
 

1073
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,780
to the hopper this one this hoppers
faces to the left this one faces to the

1074
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:16,790
faces to the left this one faces to the
 

1075
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,880
faces to the left this one faces to the
right into the chest and that's about

1076
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:18,890
right into the chest and that's about
 

1077
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,190
right into the chest and that's about
all you need oh yeah and then there's

1078
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
all you need oh yeah and then there's
 

1079
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,330
all you need oh yeah and then there's
weight on that one

1080
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:25,340
weight on that one
 

1081
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,410
weight on that one
there's items in there to identify it

1082
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:28,420
there's items in there to identify it
 

1083
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,510
there's items in there to identify it
anyway so we got our comment for today

1084
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
anyway so we got our comment for today
 

1085
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,820
anyway so we got our comment for today
picked outs and I thought I'd bring this

1086
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:33,830
picked outs and I thought I'd bring this
 

1087
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,350
picked outs and I thought I'd bring this
one up because I kind of forgot to look

1088
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
one up because I kind of forgot to look
 

1089
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,240
one up because I kind of forgot to look
at this when we were in the creative

1090
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,250
at this when we were in the creative
 

1091
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,660
at this when we were in the creative
worlds before but it says a etho I saw

1092
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:40,670
worlds before but it says a etho I saw
 

1093
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,550
worlds before but it says a etho I saw
that boat launcher thing you built and

1094
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:42,560
that boat launcher thing you built and
 

1095
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,290
that boat launcher thing you built and
thought maybe you could try creating a

1096
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,300
thought maybe you could try creating a
 

1097
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,710
thought maybe you could try creating a
minecart launcher as well three or so

1098
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:47,720
minecart launcher as well three or so
 

1099
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,840
minecart launcher as well three or so
power rails and then launch with a slime

1100
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:49,850
power rails and then launch with a slime
 

1101
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,090
power rails and then launch with a slime
block land on a power rail and keep

1102
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,100
block land on a power rail and keep
 

1103
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,900
block land on a power rail and keep
going until it until at destination also

1104
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:55,910
going until it until at destination also
 

1105
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,910
going until it until at destination also
