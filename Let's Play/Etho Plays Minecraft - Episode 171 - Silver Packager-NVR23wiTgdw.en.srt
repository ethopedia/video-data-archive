00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,269
all right everybody welcome back this is
etho time for another let's play episode

00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:16,279
etho time for another let's play episode

00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,109
etho time for another let's play episode
so first of all to begin with I died

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
so first of all to begin with I died
 

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,769
so first of all to begin with I died
died in the end Enderman pushed me off

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:24,779
died in the end Enderman pushed me off
 

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,290
died in the end Enderman pushed me off
into the void so I lost my good picks I

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,300
into the void so I lost my good picks I
 

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,880
into the void so I lost my good picks I
lost my shovels my axe my sword my armor

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:31,890
lost my shovels my axe my sword my armor
 

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,209
lost my shovels my axe my sword my armor
everything basically but I went on in

14
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:35,219
everything basically but I went on in
 

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,930
everything basically but I went on in
chanting frenzy after that because I had

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:38,940
chanting frenzy after that because I had
 

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,910
chanting frenzy after that because I had
no good tools so this is my new stuff

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:42,920
no good tools so this is my new stuff
 

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,380
no good tools so this is my new stuff
actually I had that from before but I

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,390
actually I had that from before but I
 

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,680
actually I had that from before but I
made that this this and I had that there

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:48,690
made that this this and I had that there
 

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,770
made that this this and I had that there
before too on the on the plus side at

24
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:51,780
before too on the on the plus side at
 

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,049
before too on the on the plus side at
least my axe and all that was pretty

26
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:54,059
least my axe and all that was pretty
 

27
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,720
least my axe and all that was pretty
close to breaking the shovel my boots so

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:56,730
close to breaking the shovel my boots so
 

29
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,779
close to breaking the shovel my boots so
it wasn't a huge loss but at the same

30
00:00:59,779 --> 00:00:59,789
it wasn't a huge loss but at the same
 

31
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,960
it wasn't a huge loss but at the same
time it really sucked to begin with

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:05,970
time it really sucked to begin with
 

33
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,100
time it really sucked to begin with
today I wanted to work on this room here

34
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,110
today I wanted to work on this room here
 

35
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,850
today I wanted to work on this room here
the silverfish

36
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:10,860
the silverfish
 

37
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,240
the silverfish
storage room where we store them as

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,250
storage room where we store them as
 

39
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,999
storage room where we store them as
blocks in here from our silverfish

40
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:17,009
blocks in here from our silverfish
 

41
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,410
blocks in here from our silverfish
factory over here which is currently

42
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,420
factory over here which is currently
 

43
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,550
factory over here which is currently
disabled from the lights so what we got

44
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
disabled from the lights so what we got
 

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,030
disabled from the lights so what we got
to do with this project we got Pistons

46
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
to do with this project we got Pistons
 

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,190
to do with this project we got Pistons
pushing a line of the silverfish blocks

48
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
pushing a line of the silverfish blocks
 

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,620
pushing a line of the silverfish blocks
here then that gets moved down with this

50
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,630
here then that gets moved down with this
 

51
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,120
here then that gets moved down with this
piston here this is a smart piston a

52
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,130
piston here this is a smart piston a
 

53
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,510
piston here this is a smart piston a
downward one we have to make it go

54
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,520
downward one we have to make it go
 

55
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,700
downward one we have to make it go
downward because I don't think you can

56
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:46,710
downward because I don't think you can
 

57
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,120
downward because I don't think you can
actually make an upward smart piston I

58
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,130
actually make an upward smart piston I
 

59
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,219
actually make an upward smart piston I
could be wrong it's something I played

60
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,229
could be wrong it's something I played
 

61
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,539
could be wrong it's something I played
around with before though and I could

62
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:53,549
around with before though and I could
 

63
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,580
around with before though and I could
never figure out a way of doing it so

64
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,590

 

65
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,480

got to make it go down

66
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,490
got to make it go down
 

67
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,819
got to make it go down
this will make it stack into a column a

68
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:01,829
this will make it stack into a column a
 

69
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,639
this will make it stack into a column a
bunch of blocks and then when it gets to

70
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:04,649
bunch of blocks and then when it gets to
 

71
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,660
bunch of blocks and then when it gets to
the very bottom we need like when a

72
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,670
the very bottom we need like when a
 

73
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,780
the very bottom we need like when a
block hits this part here we need all

74
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:11,790
block hits this part here we need all
 

75
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,460
block hits this part here we need all
these Pistons to extend

76
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,470
these Pistons to extend
 

77
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,430
these Pistons to extend
and push out this way and then when it

78
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
and push out this way and then when it
 

79
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,270
and push out this way and then when it
gets to when that wall gets 12 blocks

80
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
gets to when that wall gets 12 blocks
 

81
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,480
gets to when that wall gets 12 blocks
long we need another detector over here

82
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,490
long we need another detector over here
 

83
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,560
long we need another detector over here
and then have a whole big wall of

84
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,570
and then have a whole big wall of
 

85
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,550
and then have a whole big wall of
pistons a 12 by 6 high wall of Pistons

86
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
pistons a 12 by 6 high wall of Pistons
 

87
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,960
pistons a 12 by 6 high wall of Pistons
push the blocks this way to make a big

88
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:37,970
push the blocks this way to make a big
 

89
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,150
push the blocks this way to make a big
12 by I believe 13 by 6 set of

90
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
12 by I believe 13 by 6 set of
 

91
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,699
12 by I believe 13 by 6 set of
silverfish blocks in the end that's the

92
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:46,709
silverfish blocks in the end that's the
 

93
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,470
silverfish blocks in the end that's the
final thing so it basically goes from

94
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
final thing so it basically goes from
 

95
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,730
final thing so it basically goes from
one dimensional a line here to 2 to 2

96
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:52,740
one dimensional a line here to 2 to 2
 

97
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,730
one dimensional a line here to 2 to 2
dimensional the column which creates a

98
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:55,740
dimensional the column which creates a
 

99
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,820
dimensional the column which creates a
wall and then finally three dimensional

100
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,830
wall and then finally three dimensional
 

101
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,830
wall and then finally three dimensional
we kind of get a cube at the end of all

102
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
we kind of get a cube at the end of all
 

103
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
we kind of get a cube at the end of all
this not a cube but you know a

104
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:02,810
this not a cube but you know a
 

105
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,160
this not a cube but you know a
3-dimensional shape after all that so I

106
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,170
3-dimensional shape after all that so I
 

107
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,010
3-dimensional shape after all that so I
got a dig down quite a ways here and try

108
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,020
got a dig down quite a ways here and try
 

109
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,870
got a dig down quite a ways here and try
and make this look a little less chaotic

110
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:14,880
and make this look a little less chaotic
 

111
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,540
and make this look a little less chaotic
so I just I'll get to work with my new

112
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:17,550
so I just I'll get to work with my new
 

113
00:03:17,550 --> 00:05:24,399
so I just I'll get to work with my new
tools and see how it goes

114
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:24,409

 

115
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,320

all right so we got most of that space

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,330
all right so we got most of that space
 

117
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,959
all right so we got most of that space
cleared out now that we're going to need

118
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:31,969
cleared out now that we're going to need
 

119
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:38,709
cleared out now that we're going to need
it's a big room really is basically I

120
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:38,719
it's a big room really is basically I
 

121
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,080
it's a big room really is basically I
want it so we can walk underneath the

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,090
want it so we can walk underneath the
 

123
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,719
want it so we can walk underneath the
silverfish box yet if if the room is

124
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:44,729
silverfish box yet if if the room is
 

125
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,760
silverfish box yet if if the room is
full you know so we'll need two blocks

126
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:48,770
full you know so we'll need two blocks
 

127
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,490
full you know so we'll need two blocks
for that and then we'll have six blocks

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:52,500
for that and then we'll have six blocks
 

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,879
for that and then we'll have six blocks
high of the silverfish blocks and this

130
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:55,889
high of the silverfish blocks and this
 

131
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,149
high of the silverfish blocks and this
here will just be floor of whatever

132
00:05:59,149 --> 00:05:59,159
here will just be floor of whatever
 

133
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,760
here will just be floor of whatever
block we choose still don't know what

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:01,770
block we choose still don't know what
 

135
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,559
block we choose still don't know what
what type of blocks we're going to do or

136
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:03,569
what type of blocks we're going to do or
 

137
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,580
what type of blocks we're going to do or
how we're going to decorate it or

138
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:04,590
how we're going to decorate it or
 

139
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,510
how we're going to decorate it or
anything like that but the next step to

140
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
anything like that but the next step to
 

141
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,119
anything like that but the next step to
this is going to be making the piston

142
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,129
this is going to be making the piston
 

143
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:19,629
this is going to be making the piston
wall over here so I believe it will go

144
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:19,639
wall over here so I believe it will go
 

145
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:28,059
wall over here so I believe it will go
one block away from that and like that

146
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:28,069
one block away from that and like that
 

147
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,640
one block away from that and like that
twelve blocks long and six blocks high I

148
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:33,650
twelve blocks long and six blocks high I
 

149
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,439
twelve blocks long and six blocks high I
think that's right yeah all right so

150
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:39,449
think that's right yeah all right so
 

151
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,939
think that's right yeah all right so
that's the next step to this it's going

152
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:40,949
that's the next step to this it's going
 

153
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,290
that's the next step to this it's going
to take a lot of pistons and if you guys

154
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,300
to take a lot of pistons and if you guys
 

155
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,879
to take a lot of pistons and if you guys
have noticed my videos have been a

156
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:49,889
have noticed my videos have been a
 

157
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,040
have noticed my videos have been a
little bit irregular lately it's because

158
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,050
little bit irregular lately it's because
 

159
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,559
little bit irregular lately it's because
I'm just about in my busy season of work

160
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:54,569
I'm just about in my busy season of work
 

161

that and then I'll try to let's play
 

195
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,480
that and then I'll try to let's play
episodes as I can but the thing is I

episodes as I can but the thing is I
 

197
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,219
episodes as I can but the thing is I
don't want to do an episode if I'm not

00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:57,229
don't want to do an episode if I'm not
 

199
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,330
don't want to do an episode if I'm not
in the mood and I've always always felt

200
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:01,340
in the mood and I've always always felt
 

201
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,680
in the mood and I've always always felt
that way like if I don't feel like

playing I'm not going to play because it
 

205
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,550
playing I'm not going to play because it
won't be fun for me and it will show in

206
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:09,560
won't be fun for me and it will show in
 

207
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,610
won't be fun for me and it will show in
the video too so we'll see how it goes

208
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:15,620
the video too so we'll see how it goes
 

209
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,010
the video too so we'll see how it goes
but I know last year this was back like

but I know last year this was back like
 

211
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,520
but I know last year this was back like
around the episodes I think 70 or so was

the episodes got a lot more talky and a

216
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,110
the episodes got a lot more talky and a
 

217
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,930
the episodes got a lot more talky and a
lot less buildi so that might happen

218
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:34,940
lot less buildi so that might happen
 

219
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,260
lot less buildi so that might happen
again might do caving and whatnot who

220
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,270
again might do caving and whatnot who
 

221
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,800
again might do caving and whatnot who
knows who knows I'll try to keep it

222
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:44,810
knows who knows I'll try to keep it
 

223
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:53,790
knows who knows I'll try to keep it
entertaining though as much as I can and

224
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:53,800

 

225
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,350

I'll probably not be able to play other

226
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,360
I'll probably not be able to play other
 

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,269
I'll probably not be able to play other
series like the Ultra Hardcore until

much silver fish damage around here

244
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,300
much silver fish damage around here
 

245
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,579
much silver fish damage around here
because I must've missed killing a few

246
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:27,589
because I must've missed killing a few
 

247
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,980
because I must've missed killing a few
of them and they just kept breaking more

248
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:29,990
of them and they just kept breaking more
 

249
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,019
of them and they just kept breaking more
and more blocks every time I killed them

250
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:34,029
and more blocks every time I killed them
 

251
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,320
and more blocks every time I killed them
um I will finish this up and then we

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,330
um I will finish this up and then we
 

253
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,699
um I will finish this up and then we
will start doing the wiring for it

254
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:39,709
will start doing the wiring for it
 

255
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:44,440
will start doing the wiring for it
should be fairly simple I imagine OOP so

256
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,450
should be fairly simple I imagine OOP so
 

257
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,550
should be fairly simple I imagine OOP so
I'll be back in a little bit

just had to make a pit stop here to pick

262
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,430
just had to make a pit stop here to pick
 

263
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,490
just had to make a pit stop here to pick
up some glowstone for the wiring and

264
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
up some glowstone for the wiring and
 

265
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,810
up some glowstone for the wiring and
some better food because these melons

266
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:58,820
some better food because these melons

I'm sick of them this window here is new

268
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm sick of them this window here is new
 

269
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,070
I'm sick of them this window here is new
this is going to be for the furnace room

270
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,080
this is going to be for the furnace room
 

271
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,560
this is going to be for the furnace room
I don't know what I'm going to do with

272
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:09,570
I don't know what I'm going to do with
 

273
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,420
I don't know what I'm going to do with
the furnace room all I know is I wanted

274
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,430
the furnace room all I know is I wanted
 

275
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,210
the furnace room all I know is I wanted
a window a three by three window there

276
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,220
a window a three by three window there
 

277
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,520
a window a three by three window there
for some reason is like window popped in

278
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,530
for some reason is like window popped in
 

279
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,360
for some reason is like window popped in
my head and I wanted it so I've made

280
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,370
my head and I wanted it so I've made
 

281
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,460
my head and I wanted it so I've made
that happen so this is where the furnace

282
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,470
that happen so this is where the furnace
 

283
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,060
that happen so this is where the furnace
room will be eventually in the space

284
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,070
room will be eventually in the space
 

285
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,650
room will be eventually in the space
here and I just wanted to see what it

286
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:27,660
here and I just wanted to see what it
 

287
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,180
here and I just wanted to see what it
would look like from the side too that's

288
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,190
would look like from the side too that's
 

289
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,640
would look like from the side too that's
why I have that dug out when I do

290
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,650
why I have that dug out when I do
 

291
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,250
why I have that dug out when I do
eventually build the room and it's a

292
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,260
eventually build the room and it's a
 

293
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,530
eventually build the room and it's a
pretty decent view I would say so

294
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,540
pretty decent view I would say so
 

295
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,640
pretty decent view I would say so
haven't forgotten about this part we

296
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,650
haven't forgotten about this part we
 

297
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,380
haven't forgotten about this part we
will continue to work on this even

298
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,390
will continue to work on this even
 

299
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,630
will continue to work on this even
though we're building way over there now

300
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
though we're building way over there now
 

301
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,650
though we're building way over there now
too and I also dug through here to see

302
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:48,660
too and I also dug through here to see
 

303
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,330
too and I also dug through here to see
how it would connect with that upper

304
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,340
how it would connect with that upper
 

305
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,870
how it would connect with that upper
parts just get a feel for the distance

306
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
parts just get a feel for the distance
 

307
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,980
parts just get a feel for the distance
and the height change and whatnot so

308
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:57,990
and the height change and whatnot so
 

309
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,570
and the height change and whatnot so
we'll probably connect with over here

310
00:10:59,570 --> 00:10:59,580
we'll probably connect with over here
 

311
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,270
we'll probably connect with over here
eventually put in the staircase or

312
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,280
eventually put in the staircase or
 

313
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,230
eventually put in the staircase or
something over here and should be pretty

314
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
something over here and should be pretty
 

315
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,250
something over here and should be pretty
good all right and also the jukebox

316
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,260
good all right and also the jukebox
 

317
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,480
good all right and also the jukebox
station here

318
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,490
station here
 

319
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,000
station here
got a few good suggestions on how to do

320
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,010
got a few good suggestions on how to do
 

321
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,060
got a few good suggestions on how to do
it and I might follow them the only

322
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,070
it and I might follow them the only
 

323
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,500
it and I might follow them the only
problem is a lot of people didn't take

324
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,510
problem is a lot of people didn't take
 

325
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,300
problem is a lot of people didn't take
into consideration this wall over here

326
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,310
into consideration this wall over here
 

327
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,819
into consideration this wall over here
so with the videos people sent me like

328
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:30,829
so with the videos people sent me like
 

329
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,430
so with the videos people sent me like
this might be wood over here and that

330
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
this might be wood over here and that
 

331
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,000
this might be wood over here and that
looks really bad if you got one one

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,010
looks really bad if you got one one
 

333
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,400
looks really bad if you got one one
block of wood from this side so I will

334
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,410
block of wood from this side so I will
 

335
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,079
block of wood from this side so I will
mess around with it though probably and

336
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,089
mess around with it though probably and
 

337
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,949
mess around with it though probably and
make it look a little bit better but I'm

338
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:47,959
make it look a little bit better but I'm
 

339
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,509
make it look a little bit better but I'm
gonna grab the glowstone grab some food

340
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
gonna grab the glowstone grab some food
 

341
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,780
gonna grab the glowstone grab some food
and we will head back okay so I believe

342
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:55,790
and we will head back okay so I believe
 

343
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,280
and we will head back okay so I believe
I have this all working now got all the

344
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,290
I have this all working now got all the
 

345
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,050
I have this all working now got all the
Redstone wiring done and all pistons in

346
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,060
Redstone wiring done and all pistons in
 

347
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,300
Redstone wiring done and all pistons in
place so let's just go through it real

348
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,310
place so let's just go through it real
 

349
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,340
place so let's just go through it real
quick

350
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,350
quick
 

351
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,340
quick
basically that piston up there is a

352
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,350
basically that piston up there is a
 

353
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,170
basically that piston up there is a
smart piston um so if a block goes in

354
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,180
smart piston um so if a block goes in
 

355
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,560
smart piston um so if a block goes in
front of it it will automatically push

356
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,570
front of it it will automatically push
 

357
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,050
front of it it will automatically push
it down and every time that happens it

358
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,060
it down and every time that happens it
 

359
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,620
it down and every time that happens it
keeps pushing them down until they get

360
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:23,630
keeps pushing them down until they get
 

361
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,380
keeps pushing them down until they get
to the bottom piston here which is also

362
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,390
to the bottom piston here which is also
 

363
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,500
to the bottom piston here which is also
a smart piston but in control it

364
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,510
a smart piston but in control it
 

365
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,490
a smart piston but in control it
controls this whole column so when it

366
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,500
controls this whole column so when it
 

367
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,509
controls this whole column so when it
gets here it all extends and six blocks

368
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
gets here it all extends and six blocks
 

369
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,910
gets here it all extends and six blocks
get pushed this way and then that leaves

370
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
get pushed this way and then that leaves
 

371
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,230
get pushed this way and then that leaves
space for new ones to come down and

372
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,240
space for new ones to come down and
 

373
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:51,910
space for new ones to come down and
slotting no get there get there come on

374
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
slotting no get there get there come on
 

375
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,389
slotting no get there get there come on
there okay so the way this works is we

376
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:55,399
there okay so the way this works is we
 

377
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,210
there okay so the way this works is we
have a lever here powering the redstone

378
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,220
have a lever here powering the redstone
 

379
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,819
have a lever here powering the redstone
wire and when it gets cut when a block

380
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:00,829
wire and when it gets cut when a block
 

381
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:05,639
wire and when it gets cut when a block
gets placed here it switches it off and

382
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:05,649
gets placed here it switches it off and
 

383
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,040
gets placed here it switches it off and
that triggers this it goes around here

384
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,050
that triggers this it goes around here
 

385
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,569
that triggers this it goes around here
to redstone torch and that goes up to

386
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:12,579
to redstone torch and that goes up to
 

387
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,780
to redstone torch and that goes up to
there's wire there and then wire on top

388
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:16,790
there's wire there and then wire on top
 

389
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,199
there's wire there and then wire on top
of all this glowstone which sends power

390
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:20,209
of all this glowstone which sends power
 

391
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,269
of all this glowstone which sends power
to all the Pistons and there's also one

392
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:22,279
to all the Pistons and there's also one
 

393
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,840
to all the Pistons and there's also one
block here which prevents this wire from

394
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:25,850
block here which prevents this wire from
 

395
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,180
block here which prevents this wire from
connecting to that

396
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,190
connecting to that
 

397
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,640
connecting to that
they're so yeah this goes off for a

398
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:33,650
they're so yeah this goes off for a
 

399
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,640
they're so yeah this goes off for a
split second which switches a torch

400
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,650
split second which switches a torch
 

401
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,920
split second which switches a torch
makes a piston extend and then the block

402
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:38,930
makes a piston extend and then the block
 

403
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,900
makes a piston extend and then the block
is no longer cutting the wire so it

404
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:40,910
is no longer cutting the wire so it
 

405
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,470
is no longer cutting the wire so it
retracts and that's basically what

406
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
retracts and that's basically what
 

407
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,970
retracts and that's basically what
happens over here - we have another

408
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:45,980
happens over here - we have another
 

409
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,490
happens over here - we have another
smart piston in this corner this one

410
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:48,500
smart piston in this corner this one
 

411
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,990
smart piston in this corner this one
here except we were using a redstone

412
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,000
here except we were using a redstone
 

413
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,960
here except we were using a redstone
torch for this one sends power up here

414
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:57,970
torch for this one sends power up here
 

415
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,160
torch for this one sends power up here
this is what happens when the block goes

416
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,170
this is what happens when the block goes
 

417
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,050
this is what happens when the block goes
there all of those extend and get pushed

418
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,060
there all of those extend and get pushed
 

419
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,750
there all of those extend and get pushed
that way um yeah there's a redstone

420
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:10,760
that way um yeah there's a redstone
 

421
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:20,410
that way um yeah there's a redstone
torch right there so this wire goes to

422
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:20,420
torch right there so this wire goes to
 

423
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,260
torch right there so this wire goes to
that torch which power is that repeater

424
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,270
that torch which power is that repeater
 

425
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,230
that torch which power is that repeater
and then it goes to that block which has

426
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
and then it goes to that block which has
 

427
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,450
and then it goes to that block which has
wire on it which powers that repeater

428
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,460
wire on it which powers that repeater
 

429
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,130
wire on it which powers that repeater
and then we use glowstone to get this

430
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,140
and then we use glowstone to get this
 

431
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,040
and then we use glowstone to get this
powered up here - to this final repeater

432
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,050
powered up here - to this final repeater
 

433
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,240
powered up here - to this final repeater
up here and then the easiest way that I

434
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,250
up here and then the easiest way that I
 

435
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,580
up here and then the easiest way that I
found of powering a wall of Pistons like

436
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,590
found of powering a wall of Pistons like
 

437
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,000
found of powering a wall of Pistons like
this is to use redstone torches each of

438
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,010
this is to use redstone torches each of
 

439
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,970
this is to use redstone torches each of
these will power two Pistons so you just

440
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:48,980
these will power two Pistons so you just
 

441
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,630
these will power two Pistons so you just
run a line a redstone wire and the line

442
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,640
run a line a redstone wire and the line
 

443
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,080
run a line a redstone wire and the line
of of torches got three layers of those

444
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,090
of of torches got three layers of those
 

445
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,760
of of torches got three layers of those
for the six layers of Pistons and it

446
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:00,770
for the six layers of Pistons and it
 

447
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,170
for the six layers of Pistons and it
seems to work pretty good I do get a

448
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,180
seems to work pretty good I do get a
 

449
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,670
seems to work pretty good I do get a
little bit of lag from this so usually

450
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
little bit of lag from this so usually
 

451
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,710
little bit of lag from this so usually
my FPS drops down to twenty-five when

452
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
my FPS drops down to twenty-five when
 

453
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
my FPS drops down to twenty-five when
I'm recording when I do that which isn't

454
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm recording when I do that which isn't
 

455
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm recording when I do that which isn't
isn't too bad um beyond this we will

456
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:19,670
isn't too bad um beyond this we will
 

457
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,390
isn't too bad um beyond this we will
have another detector on this side here

458
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:22,400
have another detector on this side here
 

459
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,870
have another detector on this side here
and it will detect when this room is

460
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:25,880
and it will detect when this room is
 

461
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
and it will detect when this room is
full and hopefully shut off the

462
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:28,970
full and hopefully shut off the
 

463
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,550
full and hopefully shut off the
silverfish factory so that it doesn't

464
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
silverfish factory so that it doesn't
 

465
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,030
silverfish factory so that it doesn't
cause problems and also send us like an

466
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
cause problems and also send us like an
 

467
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,310
cause problems and also send us like an
indicator like no blocks or something to

468
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,320
indicator like no blocks or something to
 

469
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,730
indicator like no blocks or something to
the storage room telling me to

470
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:41,740
the storage room telling me to
 

471
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,230
the storage room telling me to
come harvest the silver fish or whatever

472
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
come harvest the silver fish or whatever
 

473
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,540
come harvest the silver fish or whatever
that the rooms full we have to deal with

474
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:46,550
that the rooms full we have to deal with
 

475
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,870
that the rooms full we have to deal with
them

476
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
them
 

477
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,680
them
and Oh ay where did you come from

478
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:52,690
and Oh ay where did you come from
 

479
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,870
and Oh ay where did you come from
place really isn't safe now that the

480
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:55,880
place really isn't safe now that the
 

481
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,370
place really isn't safe now that the
silver fish I've done so much damage

482
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:57,380
silver fish I've done so much damage
 

483
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,380
silver fish I've done so much damage
everywhere we will have to encase this

484
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,390
everywhere we will have to encase this
 

485
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,720
everywhere we will have to encase this
area with blocks they can't get into and

486
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:04,730
area with blocks they can't get into and
 

487
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,290
area with blocks they can't get into and
also we'll have to pick a block for this

488
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,300
also we'll have to pick a block for this
 

489
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,000
also we'll have to pick a block for this
room here that they can't enter either

490
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,010
room here that they can't enter either
 

491
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,800
room here that they can't enter either
so that we can contain them the plan is

492
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:17,810
so that we can contain them the plan is
 

493
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:24,970
so that we can contain them the plan is
to have like a window over here that we

494
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:24,980
to have like a window over here that we
 

495
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,150
to have like a window over here that we
look into the room that will keep the

496
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
look into the room that will keep the
 

497
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
look into the room that will keep the
silverfish from getting us and we will

498
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:30,770
silverfish from getting us and we will
 

499
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,490
silverfish from getting us and we will
probably be able to break the silverfish

500
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:33,500
probably be able to break the silverfish
 

501
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,070
probably be able to break the silverfish
blocks from here and then attack them

502
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,080
blocks from here and then attack them
 

503
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,890
blocks from here and then attack them
somehow and I also would like to have

504
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:38,900
somehow and I also would like to have
 

505
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,780
somehow and I also would like to have
the snow golems along the walls here so

506
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:43,790
the snow golems along the walls here so
 

507
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,790
the snow golems along the walls here so
that they will hit the silverfish and

508
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:45,800
that they will hit the silverfish and
 

509
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,070
that they will hit the silverfish and
cause them to break like when we start

510
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,080
cause them to break like when we start
 

511
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,690
cause them to break like when we start
the chain reaction so that we don't have

512
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:49,700
the chain reaction so that we don't have
 

513
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,820
the chain reaction so that we don't have
to hit them ourselves we can get the

514
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:51,830
to hit them ourselves we can get the
 

515
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,700
to hit them ourselves we can get the
snow golems to do it for us we'll just

516
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,710
snow golems to do it for us we'll just
 

517
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,460
snow golems to do it for us we'll just
have to make an opening so that the snow

518
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,470
have to make an opening so that the snow
 

519
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,290
have to make an opening so that the snow
golems can shoot out of but the

520
00:16:59,290 --> 00:16:59,300
golems can shoot out of but the
 

521
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,290
golems can shoot out of but the
silverfish can't get to the snow golems

522
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,300
silverfish can't get to the snow golems
 

523
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,280
silverfish can't get to the snow golems
so if we have like a block here and then

524
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,290
so if we have like a block here and then
 

525
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:12,220
so if we have like a block here and then
a half slab above here like do I have

526
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,230
a half slab above here like do I have
 

527
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,370
a half slab above here like do I have
anything on me no mmm I'll just make a

528
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:18,380
anything on me no mmm I'll just make a
 

529
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,620
anything on me no mmm I'll just make a
crafting bench and show you what I mean

530
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:22,630
crafting bench and show you what I mean
 

531
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,090
crafting bench and show you what I mean
if we have the snow golems behind

532
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,100
if we have the snow golems behind
 

533
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,640
if we have the snow golems behind
something like this like if they're over

534
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,650
something like this like if they're over
 

535
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,510
something like this like if they're over
here we can do that and they should be

536
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:34,520
here we can do that and they should be
 

537
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,490
here we can do that and they should be
able to shoot out of that hole but the

538
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,500
able to shoot out of that hole but the
 

539
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,290
able to shoot out of that hole but the
silverfish won't be able to get in there

540
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,300
silverfish won't be able to get in there
 

541
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,170
silverfish won't be able to get in there
because it can't fit and a half of block

542
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:41,180
because it can't fit and a half of block
 

543
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,060
because it can't fit and a half of block
space as we've seen before so and that's

544
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,070
space as we've seen before so and that's
 

545
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,040
space as we've seen before so and that's
that's the height that skeletons and

546
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,050
that's the height that skeletons and
 

547
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,830
that's the height that skeletons and
snow golems shoot at so that will most

548
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:50,840
snow golems shoot at so that will most
 

549
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,790
snow golems shoot at so that will most
likely work

550
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:51,800
likely work
 

551
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,480
likely work
I predict I don't know what

552
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,490
I predict I don't know what
 

553
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,100
I predict I don't know what
build the room out of the what block

554
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,110
build the room out of the what block
 

555
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,540
build the room out of the what block
should we use I was thinking maybe of

556
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,550
should we use I was thinking maybe of
 

557
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,700
should we use I was thinking maybe of
using stone brick and the mossy and the

558
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:06,710
using stone brick and the mossy and the
 

559
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,620
using stone brick and the mossy and the
crack stuff so it resembles the

560
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,630
crack stuff so it resembles the
 

561
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,770
crack stuff so it resembles the
stronghold because that's what was here

562
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:11,780
stronghold because that's what was here
 

563
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,060
stronghold because that's what was here
before but if I use stone brick I'll

564
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,070
before but if I use stone brick I'll
 

565
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,669
before but if I use stone brick I'll
have to do double half slabs so they

566
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:18,679
have to do double half slabs so they
 

567
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:26,040
have to do double half slabs so they
can't enter the box to keep the look um

568
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,050

 

569
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,560

yeah beyond that for today I don't know

570
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:29,570
yeah beyond that for today I don't know
 

571
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,850
yeah beyond that for today I don't know
what we're doing so I'm going to take a

572
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:30,860
what we're doing so I'm going to take a
 

573
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,419
what we're doing so I'm going to take a
break and think about it and I'll be

574
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:34,429
break and think about it and I'll be
 

575
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:40,210
break and think about it and I'll be
back in a little bit here all right you

576
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,220
back in a little bit here all right you
 

577
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,910
back in a little bit here all right you
know what I want to do I want to play

578
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:42,920
know what I want to do I want to play
 

579
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,400
know what I want to do I want to play
around with the floor different designs

580
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,410
around with the floor different designs
 

581
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,210
around with the floor different designs
and figure out what people like

582
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,220
and figure out what people like
 

583
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,120
and figure out what people like
including myself so instead of doing the

584
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,130
including myself so instead of doing the
 

585
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,740
including myself so instead of doing the
stone brick thing I'm gonna try use

586
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:53,750
stone brick thing I'm gonna try use
 

587
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,390
stone brick thing I'm gonna try use
wooden planks first or maybe maybe only

588
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
wooden planks first or maybe maybe only
 

589
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,200
wooden planks first or maybe maybe only
I don't know first let's try a simple

590
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,210
I don't know first let's try a simple
 

591
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,510
I don't know first let's try a simple
checker pattern I've marked the center

592
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:04,520
checker pattern I've marked the center
 

593
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,780
checker pattern I've marked the center
of the room with this obsidian or at

594
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:07,790
of the room with this obsidian or at
 

595
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,720
of the room with this obsidian or at
least I think I did and we'll just see

596
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:10,730
least I think I did and we'll just see
 

597
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,669
least I think I did and we'll just see
how this looks if I do use wood I'll

598
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:12,679
how this looks if I do use wood I'll
 

599
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,140
how this looks if I do use wood I'll
have to make sure I get rid of all the

600
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,150
have to make sure I get rid of all the
 

601
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,470
have to make sure I get rid of all the
lava so it doesn't catch fire there's a

602
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:17,480
lava so it doesn't catch fire there's a
 

603
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,430
lava so it doesn't catch fire there's a
lot of it around hidden underground with

604
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,440
lot of it around hidden underground with
 

605
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,419
lot of it around hidden underground with
three guards two Ultra Hardcore oh I did

606
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:28,429
three guards two Ultra Hardcore oh I did
 

607
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:35,040
three guards two Ultra Hardcore oh I did
this wrong Ultra Hardcore season four B

608
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,050
this wrong Ultra Hardcore season four B
 

609
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,410
this wrong Ultra Hardcore season four B
that was another pretty cool ending I

610
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:38,420
that was another pretty cool ending I
 

611
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,070
that was another pretty cool ending I
think people really like that with the

612
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
think people really like that with the
 

613
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,200
think people really like that with the
wolf fight and all that that was I was

wolf fight and all that that was I was
 

615
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,080
wolf fight and all that that was I was
cool again we had a lot of fun with that

616
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,090
cool again we had a lot of fun with that

that was so close again
 

621
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,799
that was so close again
couldn't have turned out any better I

622
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:56,809
couldn't have turned out any better I
 

623
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:02,370
couldn't have turned out any better I
don't think or more suspenseful anyway

624
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,380

 

625
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,200

yeah I should have made an iron sword oh

626
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,210
yeah I should have made an iron sword oh
 

627
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,670
yeah I should have made an iron sword oh
boy but you know

628
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:09,680
boy but you know
 

629
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,900
boy but you know
that's just the way it goes there's

630
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:11,910
that's just the way it goes there's
 

631
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,340
that's just the way it goes there's
always going to be something you shoulda

632
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,350
always going to be something you shoulda
 

633
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,080
always going to be something you shoulda
did like I and you know it's just we

634
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,090
did like I and you know it's just we
 

635
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,150
did like I and you know it's just we
needed to do - we needed to do one more

636
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,160
needed to do - we needed to do one more
 

637
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,020
needed to do - we needed to do one more
heart damage basically and iron sword

638
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,030
heart damage basically and iron sword
 

639
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,810
heart damage basically and iron sword
would have done it but at the same time

640
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:26,820
would have done it but at the same time
 

641
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,090
would have done it but at the same time
you know hitting him again would have

642
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,100
you know hitting him again would have
 

643
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,500
you know hitting him again would have
done it - or you know me not shooting

644
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,510
done it - or you know me not shooting
 

645
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,240
done it - or you know me not shooting
doc probably would it would have helped

646
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,250
doc probably would it would have helped
 

647
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:42,260
doc probably would it would have helped
a lot - or overall is pretty happy with

648
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,270
a lot - or overall is pretty happy with
 

649
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,860
a lot - or overall is pretty happy with
how I did in that fight but I think the

650
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:45,870
how I did in that fight but I think the
 

651
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,280
how I did in that fight but I think the
mistakes I noticed were obviously not

652
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,290
mistakes I noticed were obviously not
 

653
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,780
mistakes I noticed were obviously not
making the iron sword I shot doc and

654
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:55,790
making the iron sword I shot doc and
 

655
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,490
making the iron sword I shot doc and
it's funny me and gewd we both pulled

656
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,500
it's funny me and gewd we both pulled
 

657
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
it's funny me and gewd we both pulled
out our bows when we were one block

658
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:00,510
out our bows when we were one block
 

659
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,290
out our bows when we were one block
apart like at the same time basically I

660
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,300
apart like at the same time basically I
 

661
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,380
apart like at the same time basically I
don't know why that was another mistake

662
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,390
don't know why that was another mistake
 

663
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,320
don't know why that was another mistake
that one was pretty funny though and

664
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,330

 

665
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,150

fighting the Wolves you know I don't

666
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
fighting the Wolves you know I don't
 

667
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,880
fighting the Wolves you know I don't
think we should have done that I think

668
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:16,890
think we should have done that I think
 

669
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,440
think we should have done that I think
we should just went straight for good

670
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,450
we should just went straight for good
 

671
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,510
we should just went straight for good
and vintage beef because wolves they got

672
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,520
and vintage beef because wolves they got
 

673
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,300
and vintage beef because wolves they got
ten hearts and if you got 14 wolves

674
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,310
ten hearts and if you got 14 wolves
 

675
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,960
ten hearts and if you got 14 wolves
that's like fighting 14 players you know

676
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:28,970
that's like fighting 14 players you know
 

677
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,430
that's like fighting 14 players you know
because they have the same hearts as as

678
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
because they have the same hearts as as
 

679
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,330
because they have the same hearts as as
a player so I think if I ever in that

680
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,340
a player so I think if I ever in that
 

681
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,860
a player so I think if I ever in that
situation again I would just go straight

682
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:36,870
situation again I would just go straight
 

683
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,380
situation again I would just go straight
for the player and not even bother with

684
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,390
for the player and not even bother with
 

685
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,040
for the player and not even bother with
the wolves but you know you don't really

686
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,050
the wolves but you know you don't really
 

687
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,890
the wolves but you know you don't really
have time to think in the heat of the

688
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:45,900
have time to think in the heat of the
 

689
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,730
have time to think in the heat of the
battle how's this looking so we'll call

690
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:49,740
battle how's this looking so we'll call
 

691
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,940
battle how's this looking so we'll call
this pattern number one kind of like it

692
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:52,950
this pattern number one kind of like it
 

693
00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:00,230
this pattern number one kind of like it
um we will try a few more so I'll be

694
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
um we will try a few more so I'll be
 

695
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,850
um we will try a few more so I'll be
right back in a sec we will call this

696
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:04,860
right back in a sec we will call this
 

697
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,600
right back in a sec we will call this
one pattern number two and if you don't

698
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,610
one pattern number two and if you don't
 

699
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,070
one pattern number two and if you don't
if you don't want it with the wood

700
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
if you don't want it with the wood
 

701
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,200
if you don't want it with the wood
blocks just say what other type of

702
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,210
blocks just say what other type of
 

703
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,060
blocks just say what other type of
blocks you would like it with otherwise

704
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,070
blocks you would like it with otherwise
 

705
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,760
blocks you would like it with otherwise
I will assume you like the wood blocks

706
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:16,770
I will assume you like the wood blocks
 

707
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,730
I will assume you like the wood blocks
the white and blue and the dark ones or

708
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:19,740
the white and blue and the dark ones or
 

709
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,550
the white and blue and the dark ones or
however I arrange it

710
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,560
however I arrange it
 

711
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,080
however I arrange it
and after I show you all these patterns

712
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,090
and after I show you all these patterns
 

713
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,940
and after I show you all these patterns
tell me which one you prefer the most

714
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:24,950
tell me which one you prefer the most
 

715
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:31,260
tell me which one you prefer the most
and how you would modify it if you would

716
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,270

 

717
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,940

okay this one's much like pattern number

718
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:33,950
okay this one's much like pattern number
 

719
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,530
okay this one's much like pattern number
two but we'll call it pattern number

720
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:35,540
two but we'll call it pattern number
 

721
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,250
two but we'll call it pattern number
three anyway and in these one-by-one

722
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,260
three anyway and in these one-by-one
 

723
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,850
three anyway and in these one-by-one
holes we could maybe put glowstone light

724
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:42,860
holes we could maybe put glowstone light
 

725
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,930
holes we could maybe put glowstone light
up the room I think that'd be pretty

726
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:43,940
up the room I think that'd be pretty
 

727
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,810
up the room I think that'd be pretty
cool

728
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:48,820

 

729
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,460

instead of having torches

730
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,470

 

731
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,950

I'll tell me which one you prefer the

732
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
I'll tell me which one you prefer the
 

733
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,380
I'll tell me which one you prefer the
most and that's the one we will probably

734
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,390
most and that's the one we will probably
 

735
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:07,600
most and that's the one we will probably
use in the comments but I will call it

736
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:07,610
use in the comments but I will call it
 

737
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,640
use in the comments but I will call it
