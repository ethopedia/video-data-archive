saw it working
 

19
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,750
saw it working
and

20
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
and
 

21
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,950
and
it worked kind of but it was a very slow

22
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
it worked kind of but it was a very slow
 

23
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,390
it worked kind of but it was a very slow
so i decided to add more layers onto the

24
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
so i decided to add more layers onto the
 

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,310
so i decided to add more layers onto the
shulker box farm here instead of just

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
shulker box farm here instead of just
 

27
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,870
shulker box farm here instead of just
having one we're gonna go with four

28
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
having one we're gonna go with four
 

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,310
having one we're gonna go with four
and i'm in the middle of building those

00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
and i'm in the middle of building those
 

31
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,310
and i'm in the middle of building those
up right now we also talked about the

32
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
up right now we also talked about the
 

33
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,110
up right now we also talked about the
idea of having a potion system to heal

34
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
idea of having a potion system to heal
 

35

the shulker
 

37
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,549
the shulker
and i worked on that it was a disaster

38
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
and i worked on that it was a disaster
 

39
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,150

basically over the years what i i've

58
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
basically over the years what i i've
 

59
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,550
basically over the years what i i've
done is i've created copies of my let's

60
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
done is i've created copies of my let's
 

61
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,789
done is i've created copies of my let's
play world and i use those as creative

62
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
play world and i use those as creative
 

63
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,469
play world and i use those as creative
worlds until they get cluttered or

64
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
worlds until they get cluttered or
 

65
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,670
worlds until they get cluttered or
outdated

66
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
outdated
 

67
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,030
outdated
and then

68
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
and then
 

69
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,190
and then
this is our real world over here this is

70
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
this is our real world over here this is
 

71
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,670
this is our real world over here this is
uh my current creative world

72
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
uh my current creative world
 

73
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,950
uh my current creative world
so here is where i've been messing

74
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
so here is where i've been messing
 

75
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,630
so here is where i've been messing
around with designing different auto

76
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
around with designing different auto
 

77
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,710
around with designing different auto
brewers for that shocker box farm

78
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
brewers for that shocker box farm
 

79
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,030
brewers for that shocker box farm
because we need something to heal up the

80
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
because we need something to heal up the
 

81
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,109
because we need something to heal up the
shockers so it doesn't die on us and

82
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
shockers so it doesn't die on us and
 

83
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,789
shockers so it doesn't die on us and
it's got to be a pretty fast auto brewer

84
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
it's got to be a pretty fast auto brewer
 

85
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,469
it's got to be a pretty fast auto brewer
like more than one brewing stand is

86
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
like more than one brewing stand is
 

87
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,789
like more than one brewing stand is
needed probably like four or five uh to

88
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
needed probably like four or five uh to
 

89
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,310
needed probably like four or five uh to
keep up with the rate we were gonna need

90
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
keep up with the rate we were gonna need
 

91
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,710
keep up with the rate we were gonna need
to heal that shulker so i've just been

92
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
to heal that shulker so i've just been
 

93
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,230
to heal that shulker so i've just been
messing around and i came up with

94
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
messing around and i came up with
 

95
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,310
messing around and i came up with
something pretty interesting over here

96
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
something pretty interesting over here
 

97
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,870
something pretty interesting over here
which i thought we were gonna use

98
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
which i thought we were gonna use
 

99
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,789
which i thought we were gonna use
spoiler it doesn't work

100
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
spoiler it doesn't work
 

101
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,789
spoiler it doesn't work
it does but it doesn't uh and we're

102
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
it does but it doesn't uh and we're
 

103
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,230
it does but it doesn't uh and we're
gonna see why but otherwise i would just

104
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
gonna see why but otherwise i would just
 

105
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,830
gonna see why but otherwise i would just
show you in our let's play world how

106
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
show you in our let's play world how
 

107
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,510
show you in our let's play world how
this works we're not gonna be building

108
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
this works we're not gonna be building
 

109
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,550
this works we're not gonna be building
this

110
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
this
 

111
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,310
this
uh but yeah basically it's an auto

112
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
uh but yeah basically it's an auto
 

113
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,270
uh but yeah basically it's an auto
brewer

114
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
brewer
 

115
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,429
brewer
that doesn't use any redstone really

116
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
that doesn't use any redstone really
 

117
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,230
that doesn't use any redstone really
it's uh it uses minecarts and water

118
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
it's uh it uses minecarts and water
 

119
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,149
it's uh it uses minecarts and water
streams to do all the complex stuff

120
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
streams to do all the complex stuff
 

121
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,109
streams to do all the complex stuff
which is i think pretty cool now the way

122
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
which is i think pretty cool now the way
 

123
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,389
which is i think pretty cool now the way
this works is in this updates

124
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
this works is in this updates
 

125
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,389
this works is in this updates
rails can go underwater but they can

126
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
rails can go underwater but they can
 

127
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,030
rails can go underwater but they can
also hold water back which allows us to

128
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
also hold water back which allows us to
 

129
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,190
also hold water back which allows us to
do some pretty new and interesting stuff

130
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
do some pretty new and interesting stuff
 

131
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,589
do some pretty new and interesting stuff
with the mine carts so as it goes by

132
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
with the mine carts so as it goes by
 

133
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,710
with the mine carts so as it goes by
here picks up the water bottles

134
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
here picks up the water bottles
 

135
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,030
here picks up the water bottles
goes up a bubble column

136
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
goes up a bubble column
 

137
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,869
goes up a bubble column
over top here and normally when it goes

138
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
over top here and normally when it goes
 

139
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,030
over top here and normally when it goes
over a hopper like on a rail

140
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
over a hopper like on a rail
 

141
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,869
over a hopper like on a rail
it'll only drop off one item but if it

142
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
it'll only drop off one item but if it
 

143
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,470
it'll only drop off one item but if it
goes over slowly like with the water

144
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
goes over slowly like with the water
 

145
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,030
goes over slowly like with the water
stream then it can drop off all three

146
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
stream then it can drop off all three
 

147
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,070
stream then it can drop off all three
and then we use water streams to time

148
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
and then we use water streams to time
 

149
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,589
and then we use water streams to time
the length it takes for the brew to

150
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
the length it takes for the brew to
 

151
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,990
the length it takes for the brew to
happen and mine carts move slower over

152
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
happen and mine carts move slower over
 

153
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,670
happen and mine carts move slower over
soul sand as well

154
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
soul sand as well
 

155
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,670
soul sand as well
so i i got a couple extra seconds that

156
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
so i i got a couple extra seconds that
 

157
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,790
so i i got a couple extra seconds that
way

158
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
way
 

159
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,110
way
and as soon as the brew finishes the

160
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
and as soon as the brew finishes the
 

161
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,550
and as soon as the brew finishes the
minecart passes underneath the brew

162
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
minecart passes underneath the brew
 

163
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,630
minecart passes underneath the brew
stand picks up the potions

164
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
stand picks up the potions
 

165
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,229
stand picks up the potions
and then it's a chaining system so then

166
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
and then it's a chaining system so then
 

167
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,589
and then it's a chaining system so then
it breaks it over here the awkward

168
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
it breaks it over here the awkward
 

169
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,790
it breaks it over here the awkward
potions

170
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
potions
 

171
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,949
potions
and it's gonna add melons to make an

172
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
and it's gonna add melons to make an
 

173
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,710
and it's gonna add melons to make an
instant healing

174
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
instant healing
 

175
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,390
instant healing
again it's going around the loop i found

176
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
again it's going around the loop i found
 

177
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,030
again it's going around the loop i found
a pattern here that's pretty compact

178
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
a pattern here that's pretty compact
 

179
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,470
a pattern here that's pretty compact
so i could squeeze a bunch of brewing

180
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
so i could squeeze a bunch of brewing
 

181
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,070
so i could squeeze a bunch of brewing
stands together

182
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
stands together
 

183
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,589
stands together
and again it's gonna go right underneath

184
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
and again it's gonna go right underneath
 

185
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,830
and again it's gonna go right underneath
that broom stand pick up the potions and

186
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
that broom stand pick up the potions and
 

187
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,589
that broom stand pick up the potions and
all in all

188
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
all in all
 

189
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,470
all in all
it works just fine actually with one or

190
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
it works just fine actually with one or
 

191
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,390
it works just fine actually with one or
two minecarts anyways so the real

192
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
two minecarts anyways so the real
 

193
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,390
two minecarts anyways so the real
problem comes in when we add more than

194
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
problem comes in when we add more than
 

195
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,470
problem comes in when we add more than
that the whole idea with the system was

196
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
that the whole idea with the system was
 

197
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,149
that the whole idea with the system was
to make a fast brewer

198
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
to make a fast brewer
 

199
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,589
to make a fast brewer
so i was trying to get it to work with

200
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
so i was trying to get it to work with
 

201
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,190
so i was trying to get it to work with
like four or five going around the loop

202
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
like four or five going around the loop
 

203
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,270
like four or five going around the loop
just space them properly build it all

204
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
just space them properly build it all
 

205
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,710
just space them properly build it all
within one chunk

206
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
within one chunk
 

207
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,030
within one chunk
everything should be fine right

208
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
everything should be fine right
 

209
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,430
everything should be fine right
well what ends up happening is kind of

210
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
well what ends up happening is kind of
 

211
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,630
well what ends up happening is kind of
weird

212
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
weird
 

213
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,030
weird
it's a little bit of a lesser known game

214
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
it's a little bit of a lesser known game
 

215
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
it's a little bit of a lesser known game
mechanic basically the more hopper

216
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
mechanic basically the more hopper
 

217
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,670
mechanic basically the more hopper
minecarts you have like in a single area

218
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
minecarts you have like in a single area
 

219
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,830
minecarts you have like in a single area
i think it it calculates it by a chunk

220
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
i think it it calculates it by a chunk
 

221
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,869
i think it it calculates it by a chunk
then uh

222
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
then uh
 

223
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,390
then uh
oh yeah of course it's working fine now

224
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
oh yeah of course it's working fine now
 

225
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,430
oh yeah of course it's working fine now
that i'm trying to show people

226
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
that i'm trying to show people
 

227
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,910
that i'm trying to show people
uh what will happen is it'll start like

228
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
uh what will happen is it'll start like
 

229
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,589
uh what will happen is it'll start like
not picking up the potions that might

230
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
not picking up the potions that might
 

231
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,910
not picking up the potions that might
only pick up two instead of all three it

232
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
only pick up two instead of all three it
 

233
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,910
only pick up two instead of all three it
might only god this one's messed up see

234
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
might only god this one's messed up see
 

235
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,990
might only god this one's messed up see
this there's only got one potion in here

236
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
this there's only got one potion in here
 

237
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,229
this there's only got one potion in here
or it might only drop off to over here

238
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
or it might only drop off to over here
 

239
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,750
or it might only drop off to over here
instead of all three like it's supposed

240
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
instead of all three like it's supposed
 

241
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,190
instead of all three like it's supposed
to

242
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
to
 

243
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,670
to
um and the reason is because mine curt

244
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
um and the reason is because mine curt
 

245
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,589
um and the reason is because mine curt
hopper mine carts share the amount of

246
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
hopper mine carts share the amount of
 

247
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,190
hopper mine carts share the amount of
items they can pick up between each

248
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
items they can pick up between each
 

249
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,190
items they can pick up between each
other so the more hopper minecarts in a

250
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
other so the more hopper minecarts in a
 

251
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,390
other so the more hopper minecarts in a
chunk

252
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
chunk
 

253
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,789
chunk
the less each one can do and when it

254
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
the less each one can do and when it
 

255
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,909
the less each one can do and when it
comes to high precision things like this

256
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
comes to high precision things like this
 

257
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,350
comes to high precision things like this
that means every once in a while it's

258
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
that means every once in a while it's
 

259
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,110
that means every once in a while it's
going to skip dropping off a potion or

260
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
going to skip dropping off a potion or
 

261
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,430
going to skip dropping off a potion or
picking one up and the whole thing

262
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
picking one up and the whole thing
 

263
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,749
picking one up and the whole thing
gets out of sync and the end result of

264
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
gets out of sync and the end result of
 

265
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,270
gets out of sync and the end result of
that is not only does it slow down

266
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
that is not only does it slow down
 

267
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,110
that is not only does it slow down
brewing and waste brewing ingredients

268
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
brewing and waste brewing ingredients
 

269
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,350
brewing and waste brewing ingredients
but also the final results sometimes you

270
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
but also the final results sometimes you
 

271
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,110
but also the final results sometimes you
end up with awkward potions in here

272
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
end up with awkward potions in here
 

273
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,350
end up with awkward potions in here
we're trying to brew instant twos

274
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
we're trying to brew instant twos
 

275
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,510
we're trying to brew instant twos
sometimes they will be missing the

276
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
sometimes they will be missing the
 

277
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,189
sometimes they will be missing the
glowstone or whatever and you'll just

278
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
glowstone or whatever and you'll just
 

279
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,110
glowstone or whatever and you'll just
get regular instant health or some won't

280
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
get regular instant health or some won't
 

281
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,830
get regular instant health or some won't
have the gunpowder aha yeah so the long

282
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
have the gunpowder aha yeah so the long
 

283
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,909
have the gunpowder aha yeah so the long
story shorts i wasted like two or three

284
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
story shorts i wasted like two or three
 

285
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,350
story shorts i wasted like two or three
hours building that

286
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
hours building that
 

287
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,189
hours building that
i was kind of sad it didn't work but i

288
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
i was kind of sad it didn't work but i
 

289
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,469
i was kind of sad it didn't work but i
thought it was pretty cool so i wanted

290
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
thought it was pretty cool so i wanted
 

291
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,790
thought it was pretty cool so i wanted
to show it off anyway uh but i did learn

292
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
to show it off anyway uh but i did learn
 

293
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,550
to show it off anyway uh but i did learn
a couple things from that so like i

294
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
a couple things from that so like i
 

295
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,189
a couple things from that so like i
always assumed the hopper sharing like i

296
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
always assumed the hopper sharing like i
 

297
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,189
always assumed the hopper sharing like i
knew about it as i was building that and

298
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
knew about it as i was building that and
 

299
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,629
knew about it as i was building that and
i thought it would be fine because i

300
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
i thought it would be fine because i
 

301
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,909
i thought it would be fine because i
assumed

302
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
assumed
 

303
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,430
assumed
it was only true when the hopper

304
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
it was only true when the hopper
 

305
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,029
it was only true when the hopper
minecarts were actually moving items

306
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
minecarts were actually moving items
 

307
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,189
minecarts were actually moving items
around but even if they're empty it

308
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
around but even if they're empty it
 

309
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,790
around but even if they're empty it
seems they will

310
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
seems they will
 

311
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,909
seems they will
share

312
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
share
 

313
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,510
share
the amount of items they can move with

314
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
the amount of items they can move with
 

315
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,990
the amount of items they can move with
each other which is news to me i didn't

316
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
each other which is news to me i didn't
 

317
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,870
each other which is news to me i didn't
know about that which is what broke it

318
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
know about that which is what broke it
 

319
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,430
know about that which is what broke it
so that's good to know and the lesson

320
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
so that's good to know and the lesson
 

321
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,350
so that's good to know and the lesson
also if you're trying to use them for

322
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
also if you're trying to use them for
 

323
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,590
also if you're trying to use them for
doing anything with precision

324
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
doing anything with precision
 

325
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,510
doing anything with precision
probably not a good idea if you're just

326
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
probably not a good idea if you're just
 

327
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,029
probably not a good idea if you're just
picking up a bunch of items like in a

328
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
picking up a bunch of items like in a
 

329
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,590
picking up a bunch of items like in a
mob farm it's fine but anytime you need

330
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
mob farm it's fine but anytime you need
 

331
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,749
mob farm it's fine but anytime you need
to precisely move items around

332
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
to precisely move items around
 

333
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,270
to precisely move items around
probably not a good idea to have more

334
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
probably not a good idea to have more
 

335
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,029
probably not a good idea to have more
than one minecart

336
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
than one minecart
 

337
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,350
than one minecart
doing the job well it looks like we

338
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
doing the job well it looks like we
 

339
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,430
doing the job well it looks like we
might have a bit of a reoccurring theme

340
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
might have a bit of a reoccurring theme
 

341
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,990
might have a bit of a reoccurring theme
today so this is quite a bit later

342
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
today so this is quite a bit later
 

343
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,909
today so this is quite a bit later
and i got the four layers built on this

344
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
and i got the four layers built on this
 

345
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,469
and i got the four layers built on this
farm right and i've been testing it out

346
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
farm right and i've been testing it out
 

347
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,430
farm right and i've been testing it out
and

348
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
and
 

349
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,629
and
well

350
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
well
 

351
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,150
well
disaster

352
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
disaster
 

353
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,189
disaster
oh man so my assumption was if we add

354
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
oh man so my assumption was if we add
 

355
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,710
oh man so my assumption was if we add
more layers to this

356
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
more layers to this
 

357
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,070
more layers to this
this guy

358
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
this guy
 

359
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,390
this guy
would have more places to duplicate to

360
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
would have more places to duplicate to
 

361
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,230
would have more places to duplicate to
and it would be less likely his

362
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
and it would be less likely his
 

363
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,230
and it would be less likely his
duplication will fail and when he

364
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
duplication will fail and when he
 

365
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,950
duplication will fail and when he
duplicates he gets healed up to full as

366
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
duplicates he gets healed up to full as
 

367
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,430
duplicates he gets healed up to full as
well which means it's more likely more

368
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
well which means it's more likely more
 

369
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,189
well which means it's more likely more
duplications will happen

370
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
duplications will happen
 

371
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,870
duplications will happen
less likely he'll want to teleport out

372
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
less likely he'll want to teleport out
 

373
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,749
less likely he'll want to teleport out
of there

374
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
of there
 

375
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,309
of there
and it the farm should get exponentially

376
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
and it the farm should get exponentially
 

377
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,110
and it the farm should get exponentially
better the more space

378
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
better the more space
 

379
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,110
better the more space
he has to teleport to the problem is it

380
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
he has to teleport to the problem is it
 

381
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,790
he has to teleport to the problem is it
seems like four layers isn't enough

382
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
seems like four layers isn't enough
 

383
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,350
seems like four layers isn't enough
space it still fails quite a bit

384
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
space it still fails quite a bit
 

385
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,830
space it still fails quite a bit
like it takes three or four shots

386
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
like it takes three or four shots
 

387
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,990
like it takes three or four shots
on average maybe for him to actually

388
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
on average maybe for him to actually
 

389
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,710
on average maybe for him to actually
duplicate to one of those places and it

390
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
duplicate to one of those places and it
 

391
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,950
duplicate to one of those places and it
only takes him like two shots

392
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
only takes him like two shots
 

393
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,270
only takes him like two shots
to get down to half health and then want

394
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
to get down to half health and then want
 

395
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,629
to get down to half health and then want
to teleport out of there and now we've

396
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
to teleport out of there and now we've
 

397
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,790
to teleport out of there and now we've
given him so much more space to teleport

398
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
given him so much more space to teleport
 

399
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,070
given him so much more space to teleport
to

400
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
to
 

401
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,390
to
that uh he's out of there

402
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
that uh he's out of there
 

403
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,230
that uh he's out of there
like right away he doesn't stick around

404
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
like right away he doesn't stick around
 

405
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,350
like right away he doesn't stick around
he's gone

406
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
he's gone
 

407
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
he's gone
uh so

408
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
uh so
 

409
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,350
uh so
that's an issue

410
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
that's an issue
 

411
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,909
that's an issue
and i've tried spam spamming him with

412
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
and i've tried spam spamming him with
 

413
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,909
and i've tried spam spamming him with
healing potions and it just can't keep

414
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
healing potions and it just can't keep
 

415
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,990
healing potions and it just can't keep
up he damages himself so quickly that no

416
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
up he damages himself so quickly that no
 

417
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,309
up he damages himself so quickly that no
it's not going to work and if we try to

418
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
it's not going to work and if we try to
 

419
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,390
it's not going to work and if we try to
add like a

420
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
add like a
 

421
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,309
add like a
replacement system where when the shulk

422
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
replacement system where when the shulk
 

423
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,469
replacement system where when the shulk
box disappears that we put a new one in

424
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
box disappears that we put a new one in
 

425
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,390
box disappears that we put a new one in
there it's just going to take too long i

426
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
there it's just going to take too long i
 

427
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,390
there it's just going to take too long i
think for the farm to run

428
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
think for the farm to run
 

429
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,070
think for the farm to run
at a decent rate even because every time

430
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
at a decent rate even because every time
 

431
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,589
at a decent rate even because every time
we replace this guy

432
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
we replace this guy
 

433
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,670
we replace this guy
if he teleports out of there the

434
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
if he teleports out of there the
 

435
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,350
if he teleports out of there the
snowglobe's gotta require target we

436
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
snowglobe's gotta require target we
 

437
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,950
snowglobe's gotta require target we
gotta detect when he leaves and get a

438
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
gotta detect when he leaves and get a
 

439
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,070
gotta detect when he leaves and get a
new one to

440
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
new one to
 

441
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,309
new one to
get carted over or whatever and this is

442
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
get carted over or whatever and this is
 

443
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,830
get carted over or whatever and this is
not gonna be very good

444
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
not gonna be very good
 

445
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,550
not gonna be very good
so

446
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
so
 

447
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,230
so
you guys might not like me for this but

448
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
you guys might not like me for this but
 

449
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,350
you guys might not like me for this but
i'm going to be building a new shocker

450
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
i'm going to be building a new shocker
 

451
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,469
i'm going to be building a new shocker
box farm

452
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
box farm
 

453
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,070
box farm
the other option is we tear down all

454
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
the other option is we tear down all
 

455
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,070
the other option is we tear down all
this stuff and add like 8 or 12 layers

456
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
this stuff and add like 8 or 12 layers
 

457
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,830
this stuff and add like 8 or 12 layers
to the thing and then it might work but

458
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
to the thing and then it might work but
 

459
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,350
to the thing and then it might work but
the problem is there's also the chance

460
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
the problem is there's also the chance
 

461
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,870
the problem is there's also the chance
it might fail again and we're back to

462
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
it might fail again and we're back to
 

463
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,270
it might fail again and we're back to
square one uh which i don't want to take

464
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
square one uh which i don't want to take
 

465
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,749
square one uh which i don't want to take
the risk on also there was some issues

466
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
the risk on also there was some issues
 

467
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,990
the risk on also there was some issues
where the snowglobe might randomly die i

468
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
where the snowglobe might randomly die i
 

469
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,629
where the snowglobe might randomly die i
never figured out why that was and i did

470
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
never figured out why that was and i did
 

471
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,749
never figured out why that was and i did
see

472
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
see
 

473
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,830
see
the minecarts break on me from the

474
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
the minecarts break on me from the
 

475
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,909
the minecarts break on me from the
choker box collection system so there's

476
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
choker box collection system so there's
 

477
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,189
choker box collection system so there's
like a lot of little problems with that

478
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
like a lot of little problems with that
 

479
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,469
like a lot of little problems with that
farm too

480
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
farm too
 

481
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,309
farm too
um and while i was building it i came up

482
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
um and while i was building it i came up
 

483
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,629
um and while i was building it i came up
with a new idea that i'm way more

484
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
with a new idea that i'm way more
 

485
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,710
with a new idea that i'm way more
excited about and i've

486
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
excited about and i've
 

487
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,550
excited about and i've
after that one failed i decided to test

488
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
after that one failed i decided to test
 

489
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,950
after that one failed i decided to test
it out the new idea and it works way

490
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
it out the new idea and it works way
 

491
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,110
it out the new idea and it works way
better now the main downside to building

492
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
better now the main downside to building
 

493
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,869
better now the main downside to building
a new shulker box farm is we have to get

494
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
a new shulker box farm is we have to get
 

495
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,029
a new shulker box farm is we have to get
brand new materials for it uh but

496
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
brand new materials for it uh but
 

497
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,950
brand new materials for it uh but
thankfully it's mostly just glass and

498
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
thankfully it's mostly just glass and
 

499
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,790
thankfully it's mostly just glass and
sandstone we're gonna be building out of

500
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
sandstone we're gonna be building out of
 

501
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,629
sandstone we're gonna be building out of
i grabbed some rails so we can cart a

502
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
i grabbed some rails so we can cart a
 

503
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,270
i grabbed some rails so we can cart a
shocker over to our main island area

504
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
shocker over to our main island area
 

505
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,469
shocker over to our main island area
i found one

506
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
i found one
 

507
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,710
i found one
just uh 2 000 blocks away there's a

508
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
just uh 2 000 blocks away there's a
 

509
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,029
just uh 2 000 blocks away there's a
leftover one in one of my fortresses

510
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
leftover one in one of my fortresses
 

511
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,709
leftover one in one of my fortresses
so i think it's worth just bringing it

512
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
so i think it's worth just bringing it
 

513
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,389
so i think it's worth just bringing it
back here actually

514
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
back here actually
 

515
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,630
back here actually
and we got to get started

516
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
and we got to get started
 

517
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,389
and we got to get started
off the main island here we're going to

518
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
off the main island here we're going to
 

519
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,070
off the main island here we're going to
go way down to the bottom of the world

520
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
go way down to the bottom of the world
 

521
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,430
go way down to the bottom of the world
and then we're gonna build way up to the

522
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
and then we're gonna build way up to the
 

523
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,350
and then we're gonna build way up to the
top of the world it's gonna be a huge

524
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
top of the world it's gonna be a huge
 

525
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,630
top of the world it's gonna be a huge
giant skinny farm is the plan

526
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
giant skinny farm is the plan
 

527
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,470
giant skinny farm is the plan
and

528
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
and
 

529
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,790
and
i think this is the best way of uh

530
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
i think this is the best way of uh
 

531
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,870
i think this is the best way of uh
starting out right i don't know

532
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
starting out right i don't know
 

533
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,630
starting out right i don't know
usually i just use a water bucket and

534
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
usually i just use a water bucket and
 

535
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,710
usually i just use a water bucket and
then like propel down

536
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
then like propel down
 

537
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,030
then like propel down
and build off of the island down and

538
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
and build off of the island down and
 

539
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,110
and build off of the island down and
just try to keep an eye i don't go past

540
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
just try to keep an eye i don't go past
 

541
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,110
just try to keep an eye i don't go past
zero

542
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
zero
 

543
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,190
zero
i've done it before but thankfully we

544
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
i've done it before but thankfully we
 

545
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,110
i've done it before but thankfully we
got the rockets now before you use that

546
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
got the rockets now before you use that
 

547
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,870
got the rockets now before you use that
like bow boost your way if you fell into

548
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
like bow boost your way if you fell into
 

549
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,389
like bow boost your way if you fell into
the void

550
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
the void
 

551
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,190
the void
that was uh that was scary

552
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
that was uh that was scary
 

553
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,829
that was uh that was scary
all right careful five four three

554
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
all right careful five four three
 

555
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,190
all right careful five four three
two

556
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
two
 

557
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,150
two
one we do one more

558
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
one we do one more
 

559
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,790
one we do one more
wait we can do two more

560
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
wait we can do two more
 

561
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,190
wait we can do two more
oh i can do another one

562
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
oh i can do another one
 

563
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,030
oh i can do another one
yes got it okay so that's the very

564
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
yes got it okay so that's the very
 

565
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,190
yes got it okay so that's the very
bottom of the world

566
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
bottom of the world
 

567
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,190
bottom of the world
awesome i'm gonna build off away from

568
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
awesome i'm gonna build off away from
 

569
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,870
awesome i'm gonna build off away from
our island now and it doesn't really

570
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
our island now and it doesn't really
 

571
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,470
our island now and it doesn't really
matter too much where we put this i just

572
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
matter too much where we put this i just
 

573
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,910
matter too much where we put this i just
want to be far enough away that the

574
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
want to be far enough away that the
 

575
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,990
want to be far enough away that the
dragon has like zero chance of ever

576
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
dragon has like zero chance of ever
 

577
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,150
dragon has like zero chance of ever
running into it uh-huh yeah okay so i

578
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
running into it uh-huh yeah okay so i
 

579
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,990
running into it uh-huh yeah okay so i
think the plan here is i'm gonna blitz

580
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
think the plan here is i'm gonna blitz
 

581
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,670
think the plan here is i'm gonna blitz
through building most of this farm it's

582
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
through building most of this farm it's
 

583
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,990
through building most of this farm it's
actually fairly simple except for the

584
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
actually fairly simple except for the
 

585
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
actually fairly simple except for the
bottom and the top of the farm this is

586
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
bottom and the top of the farm this is
 

587
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,670
bottom and the top of the farm this is
the bottom here so i'm going to show you

588
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
the bottom here so i'm going to show you
 

589
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,150
the bottom here so i'm going to show you
that before i cover over everything

590
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
that before i cover over everything
 

591
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,590
that before i cover over everything
and uh

592
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
and uh
 

593
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,870
and uh
you guys are probably sick of me

594
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
you guys are probably sick of me
 

595
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,350
you guys are probably sick of me
building shulker farms though

596
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
building shulker farms though
 

597
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,790
building shulker farms though
so i don't want to spend too much time

598
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
so i don't want to spend too much time
 

599
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,670
so i don't want to spend too much time
on this

600
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
on this
 

601
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,670
on this
but at the same time i really need

602
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
but at the same time i really need
 

603
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,829
but at the same time i really need
shocker shells like i need them i need

604
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
shocker shells like i need them i need
 

605
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,069
shocker shells like i need them i need
them guys they're such a big game

606
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
them guys they're such a big game
 

607
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,110
them guys they're such a big game
changer

608
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
changer
 

609
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,470
changer
uh i can't live without them now so

610
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
uh i can't live without them now so
 

611
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,190
uh i can't live without them now so
yeah let's get this actually working

612
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
yeah let's get this actually working
 

613
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,990
yeah let's get this actually working
now

614
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
now
 

615
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,910
now
the whole point of all this down here is

616
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
the whole point of all this down here is
 

617
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,389
the whole point of all this down here is
to bounce between the magma

618
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
to bounce between the magma
 

619
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,910
to bounce between the magma
block and the soul sand there's going to

620
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
block and the soul sand there's going to
 

621
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,350
block and the soul sand there's going to
be a bubble column in the center of the

622
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
be a bubble column in the center of the
 

623
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,269
be a bubble column in the center of the
farm that's either going to be

624
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
farm that's either going to be
 

625
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,870
farm that's either going to be
pushing us up with the soul sand or

626
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
pushing us up with the soul sand or
 

627
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,110
pushing us up with the soul sand or
pulling us down with magma

628
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
pulling us down with magma
 

629
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,190
pulling us down with magma
and the soul sand pushes you up faster

630
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
and the soul sand pushes you up faster
 

631
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,110
and the soul sand pushes you up faster
than the magma pulls you down so you

632
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
than the magma pulls you down so you
 

633
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,829
than the magma pulls you down so you
don't want the soul sound here as long

634
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
don't want the soul sound here as long
 

635
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,910
don't want the soul sound here as long
so we have two different timings for one

636
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
so we have two different timings for one
 

637
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,069
so we have two different timings for one
for the magma one for the soul sand and

638
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
for the magma one for the soul sand and
 

639
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,710
for the magma one for the soul sand and
the soul sand will be shorter

640
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
the soul sand will be shorter
 

641
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,790
the soul sand will be shorter
this is a sticky piston here

642
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
this is a sticky piston here
 

643
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,550
this is a sticky piston here
and this is a sticky piston here that's

644
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
and this is a sticky piston here that's
 

645
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,630
and this is a sticky piston here that's
regular that's regular and the other

646
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
regular that's regular and the other
 

647
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,829
regular that's regular and the other
thing to keep in mind whenever you're

648
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
thing to keep in mind whenever you're
 

649
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,230
thing to keep in mind whenever you're
building a shulker farm is shockers are

650
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
building a shulker farm is shockers are
 

651
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,030
building a shulker farm is shockers are
jerks they like to teleport everywhere

652
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
jerks they like to teleport everywhere
 

653
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,630
jerks they like to teleport everywhere
you don't want them to so i gotta make

654
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
you don't want them to so i gotta make
 

655
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,470
you don't want them to so i gotta make
sure every single surface is covered

656
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
sure every single surface is covered
 

657
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,550
sure every single surface is covered
here so that they can't teleport into my

658
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
here so that they can't teleport into my
 

659
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,030
here so that they can't teleport into my
redstone and mess up the rates of my

660
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
redstone and mess up the rates of my
 

661
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,150
redstone and mess up the rates of my
farms

662
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
farms
 

663
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,750
farms
okay on to the next layer here we're

664
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
okay on to the next layer here we're
 

665
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,310
okay on to the next layer here we're
gonna go a block and a half up on the

666
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
gonna go a block and a half up on the
 

667
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,870
gonna go a block and a half up on the
second glass block and then four blocks

668
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
second glass block and then four blocks
 

669
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,509
second glass block and then four blocks
out all around this thing and we end up

670
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
out all around this thing and we end up
 

671
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,430
out all around this thing and we end up
with something like this so again one

672
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
with something like this so again one
 

673
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,949
with something like this so again one
two three four

674
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
two three four
 

675
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,870
two three four
and the whole point of this layer is

676
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
and the whole point of this layer is
 

677
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,310
and the whole point of this layer is
we're gonna have a water cascading

678
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
we're gonna have a water cascading
 

679
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,550
we're gonna have a water cascading
system in this farm and this layer is

680
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
system in this farm and this layer is
 

681
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,470
system in this farm and this layer is
gonna catch that water and make sure it

682
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
gonna catch that water and make sure it
 

683
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,990
gonna catch that water and make sure it
doesn't pour down and wash away our

684
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
doesn't pour down and wash away our
 

685
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,150
doesn't pour down and wash away our
redstone we're gonna have a rim all

686
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
redstone we're gonna have a rim all
 

687
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,990
redstone we're gonna have a rim all
around the edge to catch the water i'm

688
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
around the edge to catch the water i'm
 

689
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,430
around the edge to catch the water i'm
gonna add a bunch of sea lanterns down

690
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
gonna add a bunch of sea lanterns down
 

691
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,949
gonna add a bunch of sea lanterns down
here as well just to light up the base

692
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
here as well just to light up the base
 

693
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,630
here as well just to light up the base
here make it look nice

694
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
here make it look nice
 

695
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,949
here make it look nice
and at this level is also where our item

696
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
and at this level is also where our item
 

697
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,470
and at this level is also where our item
collection system goes so all the

698
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
collection system goes so all the
 

699
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,069
collection system goes so all the
shocker shells are gonna end up in this

700
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
shocker shells are gonna end up in this
 

701
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,110
shocker shells are gonna end up in this
chest

702
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
chest
 

703
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,710
chest
and we gotta get set up some hoppers to

704
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
and we gotta get set up some hoppers to
 

705
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,350
and we gotta get set up some hoppers to
catch the shells as they fall down

706
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
catch the shells as they fall down
 

707
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,509
catch the shells as they fall down
and we kind of just do a ziggy ziggy's

708
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
and we kind of just do a ziggy ziggy's
 

709
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,069
and we kind of just do a ziggy ziggy's
id pattern like this awesome all right

710
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
id pattern like this awesome all right
 

711
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,750
id pattern like this awesome all right
so that's the bottom of the farm done

712
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
so that's the bottom of the farm done
 

713
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,509
so that's the bottom of the farm done
that's the trickiest part now we move on

714
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
that's the trickiest part now we move on
 

715
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,550
that's the trickiest part now we move on
to the body of the farm which is gonna

716
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
to the body of the farm which is gonna
 

717
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,030
to the body of the farm which is gonna
take the most time it's the biggest part

718
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
take the most time it's the biggest part
 

719
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,030
take the most time it's the biggest part
but thankfully it's an easy pattern so

720
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
but thankfully it's an easy pattern so
 

721
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,509
but thankfully it's an easy pattern so
basically this is it right here

722
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
basically this is it right here
 

723
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,990
basically this is it right here
and we have panes on the four four edges

724
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
and we have panes on the four four edges
 

725
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,430
and we have panes on the four four edges
and we just gotta build the glass up

726
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
and we just gotta build the glass up
 

727
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,350
and we just gotta build the glass up
basically it's pretty simple then in the

728
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
basically it's pretty simple then in the
 

729
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,150
basically it's pretty simple then in the
very center we also have four panes

730
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
very center we also have four panes
 

731
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,350
very center we also have four panes
like this

732
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
like this
 

733
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,750
like this
now the idea here is we're going to be

734
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
now the idea here is we're going to be
 

735
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,550
now the idea here is we're going to be
standing in the middle of farm and the

736
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
standing in the middle of farm and the
 

737
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,990
standing in the middle of farm and the
shulkers

738
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
shulkers
 

739
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,069
shulkers
will be here here here here here here

740
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
will be here here here here here here
 

741
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,190
will be here here here here here here
here here here here okay so there's 12

742
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
here here here here okay so there's 12
 

743
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,629
here here here here okay so there's 12
spots all around us they can occupy

744
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
spots all around us they can occupy
 

745
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,870
spots all around us they can occupy
and the reason for these pains is they

746
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
and the reason for these pains is they
 

747
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,870
and the reason for these pains is they
allow the shunkers to still see us they

748
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
allow the shunkers to still see us they
 

749
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,790
allow the shunkers to still see us they
don't block their vision of us

750
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
don't block their vision of us
 

751
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,870
don't block their vision of us
but they block the bullets so the

752
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
but they block the bullets so the
 

753
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,870
but they block the bullets so the
bullets will try to shoot

754
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
bullets will try to shoot
 

755
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,110
bullets will try to shoot
through the middle at us and we'll kind

756
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
through the middle at us and we'll kind
 

757
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,110
through the middle at us and we'll kind
of all funnel towards the middle

758
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
of all funnel towards the middle
 

759
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,150
of all funnel towards the middle
and

760
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
and
 

761
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,470
and
a shocker cannot

762
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
a shocker cannot
 

763
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,230
a shocker cannot
attach to the surface here because the

764
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
attach to the surface here because the
 

765
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,069
attach to the surface here because the
pain is in the way if they try to do

766
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
pain is in the way if they try to do
 

767
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,710
pain is in the way if they try to do
that so they can't open up this way they

768
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
that so they can't open up this way they
 

769
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,590
that so they can't open up this way they
have to

770
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
have to
 

771
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,829
have to
attach to this surface if they're over

772
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
attach to this surface if they're over
 

773
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,710
attach to this surface if they're over
here

774
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
here
 

775
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,389
here
and they open up towards the middle

776
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
and they open up towards the middle
 

777
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,829
and they open up towards the middle
which is where all the bullets are going

778
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
which is where all the bullets are going
 

779
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,990
which is where all the bullets are going
to funnel funnel down and there's gonna

780
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
to funnel funnel down and there's gonna
 

781
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,910
to funnel funnel down and there's gonna
be a high probability

782
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
be a high probability
 

783
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,509
be a high probability
that they'll get shot by the bullets

784
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
that they'll get shot by the bullets
 

785
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,470
that they'll get shot by the bullets
that way

786
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
that way
 

787
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,829
that way
that's the whole thing with this farm

788
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
that's the whole thing with this farm
 

789
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,230
that's the whole thing with this farm
it's kind of like a nuclear reactor

790
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
it's kind of like a nuclear reactor
 

791
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,470
it's kind of like a nuclear reactor
we gotta increase the probability of a

792
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
we gotta increase the probability of a
 

793
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,350
we gotta increase the probability of a
chain reaction going off and make sure

794
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
chain reaction going off and make sure
 

795
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,030
chain reaction going off and make sure
there's enough probability for them to

796
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
there's enough probability for them to
 

797
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,949
there's enough probability for them to
duplicate and not just fizzle out the

798
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
duplicate and not just fizzle out the
 

799
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,150
duplicate and not just fizzle out the
reaction

800
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
reaction
 

801
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,110
reaction
um

802
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
um
 

803
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,030
um
and what i found when i was testing this

804
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
and what i found when i was testing this
 

805
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,030
and what i found when i was testing this
is originally i had water on the outside

806
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
is originally i had water on the outside
 

807
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,310
is originally i had water on the outside
of this farm to stop them from

808
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
of this farm to stop them from
 

809
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,310
of this farm to stop them from
teleporting out here

810
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
teleporting out here
 

811
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,710
teleporting out here
but with just the 12 spots on each layer

812
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
but with just the 12 spots on each layer
 

813
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,190
but with just the 12 spots on each layer
on the inside of the reactor

814
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
on the inside of the reactor
 

815
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,670
on the inside of the reactor
it is not enough for the reaction to

816
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
it is not enough for the reaction to
 

817
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,870
it is not enough for the reaction to
continue

818
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
continue
 

819
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,509
continue
uh they actually need more

820
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
uh they actually need more
 

821
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,350
uh they actually need more
places they can duplicate to otherwise

822
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
places they can duplicate to otherwise
 

823
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,269
places they can duplicate to otherwise
the duplication doesn't happen often

824
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
the duplication doesn't happen often
 

825
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,670
the duplication doesn't happen often
enough and now basically i get to shut

826
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
enough and now basically i get to shut
 

827
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,230
enough and now basically i get to shut
my brain off and i get to build and go

828
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
my brain off and i get to build and go
 

829
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,389
my brain off and i get to build and go
put on a youtube video what's old doc up

830
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
put on a youtube video what's old doc up
 

831
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,550
put on a youtube video what's old doc up
to on the hermitcraft server this is the

832
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
to on the hermitcraft server this is the
 

833
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,389
to on the hermitcraft server this is the
time i catch up on my videos guys when

834
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
time i catch up on my videos guys when
 

835
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,150
time i catch up on my videos guys when
i'm doing stuff like this

836
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
i'm doing stuff like this
 

837
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,310
i'm doing stuff like this
uh also you know a lot of times when i'm

838
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
uh also you know a lot of times when i'm
 

839
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,590
uh also you know a lot of times when i'm
doing things like this i might need to

840
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
doing things like this i might need to
 

841
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,269
doing things like this i might need to
add lighting every once in a while just

842
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
add lighting every once in a while just
 

843
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,110
add lighting every once in a while just
to make it look a bit nicer and i don't

844
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
to make it look a bit nicer and i don't
 

845
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,430
to make it look a bit nicer and i don't
really like to count

846
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
really like to count
 

847
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,150
really like to count
so what i'll do is uh oh i went too far

848
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
so what i'll do is uh oh i went too far
 

849
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,750
so what i'll do is uh oh i went too far
actually

850
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
actually
 

851
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,350
actually
there's a trick to shut off your brain

852
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
there's a trick to shut off your brain
 

853
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,030
there's a trick to shut off your brain
and still like get the right placements

854
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
and still like get the right placements
 

855
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,590
and still like get the right placements
i just do every 10 blocks i'm at 30 now

856
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
i just do every 10 blocks i'm at 30 now
 

857
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,110
i just do every 10 blocks i'm at 30 now
put one over here

858
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
put one over here
 

859
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,389
put one over here
i just got to remember to check every

860
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
i just got to remember to check every
 

861
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,910
i just got to remember to check every
once in a while

862
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
once in a while
 

863
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,350
once in a while
but i don't have to count like oh one

864
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
but i don't have to count like oh one
 

865
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,949
but i don't have to count like oh one
block up two blocks up three blocks up i

866
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
block up two blocks up three blocks up i
 

867
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,069
block up two blocks up three blocks up i
just know by looking at the y

868
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
just know by looking at the y
 

869
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,310
just know by looking at the y
coordinates all right everybody check it

870
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
coordinates all right everybody check it
 

871
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,069
coordinates all right everybody check it
out we got our built up here all the way

872
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
out we got our built up here all the way
 

873
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,269
out we got our built up here all the way
to the top of the world pretty much

874
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
to the top of the world pretty much
 

875
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,590
to the top of the world pretty much
we're at 2 45 right now

876
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
we're at 2 45 right now
 

877
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,389
we're at 2 45 right now
and i did not need to go this tall with

878
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
and i did not need to go this tall with
 

879
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,470
and i did not need to go this tall with
it like even at half the size it works

880
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
it like even at half the size it works
 

881
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,590
it like even at half the size it works
just fine but i think it gets slightly

882
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
just fine but i think it gets slightly
 

883
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,230
just fine but i think it gets slightly
more efficient the taller it is and also

884
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
more efficient the taller it is and also
 

885
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,470
more efficient the taller it is and also
slightly less likely the reaction will

886
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
slightly less likely the reaction will
 

887
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,910
slightly less likely the reaction will
fizzle out so i went the full deal here

888
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
fizzle out so i went the full deal here
 

889
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,430
fizzle out so i went the full deal here
because each layer is only 20 blocks to

890
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
because each layer is only 20 blocks to
 

891
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,110
because each layer is only 20 blocks to
build so it actually goes pretty quick

892
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
build so it actually goes pretty quick
 

893
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,069
build so it actually goes pretty quick
also

894
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
also
 

895
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,829
also
anyways we're at the top now comes the

896
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
anyways we're at the top now comes the
 

897
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,990
anyways we're at the top now comes the
next next complicated part i'm going to

898
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
next next complicated part i'm going to
 

899
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,750
next next complicated part i'm going to
start putting down some slabs here again

900
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
start putting down some slabs here again
 

901
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,750
start putting down some slabs here again
so they don't attach underneath these

902
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
so they don't attach underneath these
 

903
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,509
so they don't attach underneath these
okay so the only thing we really got to

904
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
okay so the only thing we really got to
 

905
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,310
okay so the only thing we really got to
do with this top layer is add a water

906
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
do with this top layer is add a water
 

907
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,230
do with this top layer is add a water
flooding system for the outside of our

908
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
flooding system for the outside of our
 

909
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,670
flooding system for the outside of our
reactor for all the shulkers that

910
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
reactor for all the shulkers that
 

911
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,350
reactor for all the shulkers that
teleport outside

912
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
teleport outside
 

913
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,150
teleport outside
this will launch them back inside

914
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
this will launch them back inside
 

915
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,550
this will launch them back inside
but we got to keep the outside clean so

916
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
but we got to keep the outside clean so
 

917
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,230
but we got to keep the outside clean so
that they'll have that extra space to

918
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
that they'll have that extra space to
 

919
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,910
that they'll have that extra space to
duplicate too and again we're going to

920
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
duplicate too and again we're going to
 

921
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,910
duplicate too and again we're going to
do upside down slabs here to hold the

922
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
do upside down slabs here to hold the
 

923
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,590
do upside down slabs here to hold the
water in place so it doesn't spread all

924
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
water in place so it doesn't spread all
 

925
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,350
water in place so it doesn't spread all
over the place because what happens with

926
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
over the place because what happens with
 

927
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,310
over the place because what happens with
water

928
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
water
 

929
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
water
if it spreads and like joins together

930
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
if it spreads and like joins together
 

931
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,710
if it spreads and like joins together
with each other then

932
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
with each other then
 

933
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,430
with each other then
it takes much longer for it to disappear

934
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
it takes much longer for it to disappear
 

935
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,350
it takes much longer for it to disappear
and i think it also causes a lot more

936
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
and i think it also causes a lot more
 

937
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,590
and i think it also causes a lot more
lag on the game so you kind of just want

938
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
lag on the game so you kind of just want
 

939
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,910
lag on the game so you kind of just want
single columns of water flowing down the

940
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
single columns of water flowing down the
 

941
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,269
single columns of water flowing down the
side here and not really merging

942
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
side here and not really merging
 

943
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,430
side here and not really merging
together and constantly updating on the

944
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
together and constantly updating on the
 

945
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,310
together and constantly updating on the
way down so we got 16 dispensers here

946
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
way down so we got 16 dispensers here
 

947
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,069
way down so we got 16 dispensers here
and we gotta power each and every one of

948
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
and we gotta power each and every one of
 

949
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,629
and we gotta power each and every one of
them with redstone and i think the most

950
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
them with redstone and i think the most
 

951
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,069
them with redstone and i think the most
easy and efficient way of doing that is

952
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
easy and efficient way of doing that is
 

953
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,910
easy and efficient way of doing that is
just have a redstone dust

954
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
just have a redstone dust
 

955
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,509
just have a redstone dust
like that all around

956
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
like that all around
 

957
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,150
like that all around
and this if we put a block here

958
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
and this if we put a block here
 

959
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,749
and this if we put a block here
it'll power three of them

960
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
it'll power three of them
 

961
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,910
it'll power three of them
from that redstone dust if we put one

962
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
from that redstone dust if we put one
 

963
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,829
from that redstone dust if we put one
here it'll power that one but we don't

964
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
here it'll power that one but we don't
 

965
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,670
here it'll power that one but we don't
want to put another one here because

966
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
want to put another one here because
 

967
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,430
want to put another one here because
then it will get double powered it'll

968
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
then it will get double powered it'll
 

969
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,509
then it will get double powered it'll
get powered from that dust here and that

970
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
get powered from that dust here and that
 

971
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,749
get powered from that dust here and that
one there um so instead i'm gonna put a

972
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
one there um so instead i'm gonna put a
 

973
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,590
one there um so instead i'm gonna put a
glass block here each side we only need

974
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
glass block here each side we only need
 

975
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,110
glass block here each side we only need
to power four of them

976
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
to power four of them
 

977
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,110
to power four of them
and same deal glass block there glass

978
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
and same deal glass block there glass
 

979
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,710
and same deal glass block there glass
block there glass block there just keep

980
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
block there glass block there just keep
 

981
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,790
block there glass block there just keep
that pattern going

982
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
that pattern going
 

983
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,949
that pattern going
uh-huh okay so we gotta attach these

984
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
uh-huh okay so we gotta attach these
 

985
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,870
uh-huh okay so we gotta attach these
four redstone dust together but we can't

986
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
four redstone dust together but we can't
 

987
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,550
four redstone dust together but we can't
just attach them in the middle here

988
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
just attach them in the middle here
 

989
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,470
just attach them in the middle here
because that's where our water column is

990
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
because that's where our water column is
 

991
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,230
because that's where our water column is
gonna go so instead i'm gonna put some

992
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
gonna go so instead i'm gonna put some
 

993
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,710
gonna go so instead i'm gonna put some
observers facing down towards the

994
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
observers facing down towards the
 

995
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,550
observers facing down towards the
redstone

996
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
redstone
 

997
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,110
redstone
and i guess blocks here

998
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
and i guess blocks here
 

999
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,310
and i guess blocks here
underneath

1000
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
underneath
 

1001
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,069
underneath
so that'll power through the block the

1002
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
so that'll power through the block the
 

1003
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,990
so that'll power through the block the
redstone dust and then we can attach

1004
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
redstone dust and then we can attach
 

1005
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,749
redstone dust and then we can attach
them together just like this

1006
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
them together just like this
 

1007
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,910
them together just like this
oh but we're not done with it yet no no

1008
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
oh but we're not done with it yet no no
 

1009
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,629
oh but we're not done with it yet no no
no

1010
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
no
 

1011
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,509
no
we still need to regularly activate the

1012
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
we still need to regularly activate the
 

1013
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,670
we still need to regularly activate the
dispensers with some kind of clock we

1014
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
dispensers with some kind of clock we
 

1015
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,670
dispensers with some kind of clock we
also need to fire them twice once to

1016
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
also need to fire them twice once to
 

1017
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,030
also need to fire them twice once to
shoot the water out wants to pick it

1018
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
shoot the water out wants to pick it
 

1019
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,150
shoot the water out wants to pick it
back up

1020
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
back up
 

1021
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,509
back up
and

1022
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
and
 

1023
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,790
and
it's gonna get a little bit complicated

1024
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
it's gonna get a little bit complicated
 

1025
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,269
it's gonna get a little bit complicated
here so my plan is to

1026
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
here so my plan is to
 

1027
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,870
here so my plan is to
the water column's gonna be right here

1028
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
the water column's gonna be right here
 

1029
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,669
the water column's gonna be right here
right

1030
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
right
 

1031
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,510
right
whenever that switches between the soul

1032
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
whenever that switches between the soul
 

1033
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,669
whenever that switches between the soul
sand and the magma block it's gonna

1034
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
sand and the magma block it's gonna
 

1035
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,829
sand and the magma block it's gonna
update and this will detect it so it's

1036
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
update and this will detect it so it's
 

1037
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,829
update and this will detect it so it's
gonna steal the clock from all the way

1038
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
gonna steal the clock from all the way
 

1039
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,750
gonna steal the clock from all the way
at the bottom of the world there

1040
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
at the bottom of the world there
 

1041
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,750
at the bottom of the world there
and take that clock

1042
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
and take that clock
 

1043
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,789
and take that clock
and bring it up here okay

1044
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
and bring it up here okay
 

1045
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,390
and bring it up here okay
does that make sense yes it does of

1046
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
does that make sense yes it does of
 

1047
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,669
does that make sense yes it does of
course it does okay then what we do

1048
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
course it does okay then what we do
 

1049
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,429
course it does okay then what we do
is

1050
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
is
 

1051
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,750
is
take that signal

1052
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
take that signal
 

1053
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,590
take that signal
we're going to send it this way and this

1054
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
we're going to send it this way and this
 

1055
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,270
we're going to send it this way and this
part is pretty hard to explain but

1056
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
part is pretty hard to explain but
 

1057
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,029
part is pretty hard to explain but
basically there is a lot of finicky

1058
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
basically there is a lot of finicky
 

1059
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,870
basically there is a lot of finicky
timings involved with when we want the

1060
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
timings involved with when we want the
 

1061
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,750
timings involved with when we want the
wave of water to be released and also

1062
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
wave of water to be released and also
 

1063
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,669
wave of water to be released and also
like how the dispensers get activated

1064
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
like how the dispensers get activated
 

1065
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,230
like how the dispensers get activated
they're pretty picky and the observers

1066
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
they're pretty picky and the observers
 

1067
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,950
they're pretty picky and the observers
complicate that even more and uh

1068
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
complicate that even more and uh
 

1069
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,669
complicate that even more and uh
i i don't need to explain it all i hope

1070
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
i i don't need to explain it all i hope
 

1071
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,950
i i don't need to explain it all i hope
just uh

1072
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
just uh
 

1073
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,950
just uh
yeah this is what we're gonna do here so

1074
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
yeah this is what we're gonna do here so
 

1075
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,110
yeah this is what we're gonna do here so
i think i want a repeater here

1076
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
i think i want a repeater here
 

1077
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,710
i think i want a repeater here
and then we go this way and then we

1078
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
and then we go this way and then we
 

1079
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,990
and then we go this way and then we
gotta lengthen the signal again

1080
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
gotta lengthen the signal again
 

1081
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,350
gotta lengthen the signal again
for reasons

1082
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
for reasons
 

1083
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,350
for reasons
that are hard to explain

1084
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
that are hard to explain
 

1085
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,390
that are hard to explain
i think we want a block here and a block

1086
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
i think we want a block here and a block
 

1087
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,750
i think we want a block here and a block
here

1088
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
here
 

1089
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,870
here
and a repeater here at two this one's at

1090
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
and a repeater here at two this one's at
 

1091
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,870
and a repeater here at two this one's at
four i believe

1092
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
four i believe
 

1093
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,630
four i believe
there so the signal got sent here and

1094
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
there so the signal got sent here and
 

1095
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,470
there so the signal got sent here and
then again it gets extended by another

1096
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
then again it gets extended by another
 

1097
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,909
then again it gets extended by another
two ticks with this

1098
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
two ticks with this
 

1099
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,190
two ticks with this
now all we gotta do is get the water

1100
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
now all we gotta do is get the water
 

1101
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,789
now all we gotta do is get the water
column in and kind of just finish

1102
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
column in and kind of just finish
 

1103
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,230
column in and kind of just finish
putting this up and making sure

1104
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
putting this up and making sure
 

1105
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,830
putting this up and making sure
everything's spawn proof that kind of

1106
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
everything's spawn proof that kind of
 

1107
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,950
everything's spawn proof that kind of
stuff so i oh i want to sneak one in

1108
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
stuff so i oh i want to sneak one in
 

1109
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,470
stuff so i oh i want to sneak one in
over here i'm gonna build this up

1110
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
over here i'm gonna build this up
 

1111
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,390
over here i'm gonna build this up
and then maybe we'll put some slabs at

1112
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
and then maybe we'll put some slabs at
 

1113
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,270
and then maybe we'll put some slabs at
the top layer here

1114
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280

 

1115
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,950

cool we got a water bucket and all the

1116
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
cool we got a water bucket and all the
 

1117
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,029
cool we got a water bucket and all the
dispensers and now we're free to cover

1118
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
dispensers and now we're free to cover
 

1119
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,190
dispensers and now we're free to cover
over all of this so that no shockers

1120
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
over all of this so that no shockers
 

1121
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,430
over all of this so that no shockers
will will teleport here just put a slab

1122
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
will will teleport here just put a slab
 

1123
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,350
will will teleport here just put a slab
over top everything

1124
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
over top everything
 

1125
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,590
over top everything
oh snappers okay so i think this is

1126
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
oh snappers okay so i think this is
 

1127
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,990
oh snappers okay so i think this is
actually the last thing we need to do

1128
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
actually the last thing we need to do
 

1129
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,789
actually the last thing we need to do
and we gotta go get a shoulder uh but

1130
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
and we gotta go get a shoulder uh but
 

1131
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,150
and we gotta go get a shoulder uh but
we're about done with this so we're

1132
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
we're about done with this so we're
 

1133
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,990
we're about done with this so we're
gonna add a water source here

1134
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
gonna add a water source here
 

1135
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,150
gonna add a water source here
this is gonna flow down all the way to

1136
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
this is gonna flow down all the way to
 

1137
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,669
this is gonna flow down all the way to
the bottom

1138
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
the bottom
 

1139
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,669
the bottom
and we gotta turn these all into water

1140
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
and we gotta turn these all into water
 

1141
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,230
and we gotta turn these all into water
sources actually so

1142
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
sources actually so
 

1143
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,909
sources actually so
oh that was a bad throw

1144
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919

 

1145
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,669

doing
things are pretty good with me

1156

things are pretty good with me
 

1157
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,710
things are pretty good with me
that's right

1158
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
that's right
 

1159
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,070
that's right
just uh it's killing time here

1160
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
just uh it's killing time here
 

1161
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,710
just uh it's killing time here
is it coming down yet here we go

1162
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
is it coming down yet here we go
 

1163
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,150
is it coming down yet here we go
oh you can see the water on the outside

1164
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
oh you can see the water on the outside
 

1165
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,950
oh you can see the water on the outside
too coming down awesome that's working

1166
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
too coming down awesome that's working
 

1167
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,630
too coming down awesome that's working
and then it gets caught over there

1168
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
and then it gets caught over there
 

1169
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,230
and then it gets caught over there
doesn't flow over the edge or anything

1170
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
doesn't flow over the edge or anything
 

1171
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,750
doesn't flow over the edge or anything
and disappears

1172
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
and disappears
 

1173
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,029
and disappears
okay so what we're gonna do we're gonna

1174
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
okay so what we're gonna do we're gonna
 

1175
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,029
okay so what we're gonna do we're gonna
plant the kelp i brought a bunch of bone

1176
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
plant the kelp i brought a bunch of bone
 

1177
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,470
plant the kelp i brought a bunch of bone
meal here and we're just gonna grow that

1178
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
meal here and we're just gonna grow that
 

1179
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,590
meal here and we're just gonna grow that
up

1180
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
up
 

1181
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,270
up
all the way to the top and that's gonna

1182
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
all the way to the top and that's gonna
 

1183
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,029
all the way to the top and that's gonna
turn it all into water source blocks and

1184
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
turn it all into water source blocks and
 

1185
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,230
turn it all into water source blocks and
then we break it

1186
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
then we break it
 

1187
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,190
then we break it
oh my ender pro finally landed

1188
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
oh my ender pro finally landed
 

1189
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,470
oh my ender pro finally landed
okay so now we're testing out the

1190
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
okay so now we're testing out the
 

1191
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,070
okay so now we're testing out the
timings on those hopper clocks we

1192
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
timings on those hopper clocks we
 

1193
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,230
timings on those hopper clocks we
installed the bottom we want this to

1194
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
installed the bottom we want this to
 

1195
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,789
installed the bottom we want this to
take us just about to the very bottom

1196
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
take us just about to the very bottom
 

1197
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,990
take us just about to the very bottom
but we don't want to actually hit that

1198
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
but we don't want to actually hit that
 

1199
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,750
but we don't want to actually hit that
magma block

1200
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
magma block
 

1201
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,310
magma block
like we just did oh it was close though

1202
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
like we just did oh it was close though
 

1203
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,590
like we just did oh it was close though
it was really close

1204

1205
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,909

okay the magma one had 65 in let's take

1206
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
okay the magma one had 65 in let's take
 

1207
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,830
okay the magma one had 65 in let's take
that to 63

1208
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
that to 63
 

1209
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,070
that to 63
and the soul sand careful not to fall

1210
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
and the soul sand careful not to fall
 

1211
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,430
and the soul sand careful not to fall
uh we'll just take two out of there as

1212
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
uh we'll just take two out of there as
 

1213

okay everybody so this is the part of
 

1235
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,630
okay everybody so this is the part of
the project i've really been dreading we

1236
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
the project i've really been dreading we
 

1237
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,510
the project i've really been dreading we
gotta get a shocker all the way back to

1238
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
gotta get a shocker all the way back to
 

1239
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,350
gotta get a shocker all the way back to
our main end island which is two

1240
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
our main end island which is two
 

1241
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,990
our main end island which is two
thousand blocks that way now i've been

1242
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
thousand blocks that way now i've been
 

1243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,990
thousand blocks that way now i've been
trying to decide if i should do a flying

1244
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
trying to decide if i should do a flying
 

1245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,070
trying to decide if i should do a flying
machine or rails and i think i'm gonna

1246
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
machine or rails and i think i'm gonna
 

1247
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,070
machine or rails and i think i'm gonna
go with rails

1248
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
go with rails
 

1249
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,470
go with rails
just because it'll probably take longer

1250
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
just because it'll probably take longer
 

1251
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,830
just because it'll probably take longer
but it'll for sure be safer

1252
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
but it'll for sure be safer
 

1253
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,029
but it'll for sure be safer
okay

1254
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
okay
 

1255
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,549
okay
um

1256
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
um
 

1257
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,390
um
and that safer sounds better to me and

1258
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
and that safer sounds better to me and
 

1259
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,470
and that safer sounds better to me and
if for some reason he dies

1260
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
if for some reason he dies
 

1261
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,909
if for some reason he dies
we'll still have the rail here and if we

1262
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
we'll still have the rail here and if we
 

1263
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,350
we'll still have the rail here and if we
go a thousand blocks that way there's

1264
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
go a thousand blocks that way there's
 

1265
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,590
go a thousand blocks that way there's
another fortress loaded up with chalkers

1266
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
another fortress loaded up with chalkers
 

1267
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,909
another fortress loaded up with chalkers
we can grab another one

1268
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919

 

1269
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,990

oh that does not work oh snappers all

1270
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
oh that does not work oh snappers all
 

1271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,430
oh that does not work oh snappers all
right we got her done it goes all the

1272
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
right we got her done it goes all the
 

1273
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,750
right we got her done it goes all the
way to our new farm we just gotta move

1274
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
way to our new farm we just gotta move
 

1275
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,149
way to our new farm we just gotta move
this guy now uh i think it took about 40

1276
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
this guy now uh i think it took about 40
 

1277
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,070
this guy now uh i think it took about 40
minutes or so a little bit of time but

1278
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
minutes or so a little bit of time but
 

1279
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,909
minutes or so a little bit of time but

and
 

1373
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,710
and
at the start of this farm it's not

1374
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
at the start of this farm it's not
 

1375
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,549
at the start of this farm it's not
really going to do much because like we

1376
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
really going to do much because like we
 

1377
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,230
really going to do much because like we
got to pass by them and every time

there's a chance he might duplicate
 

1381
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,590

but there's supposed to be like hundreds
 

1383
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,230
but there's supposed to be like hundreds
of guys in here so most of the time as

1384
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
of guys in here so most of the time as
 

1385
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,590
of guys in here so most of the time as
we're riding this we're just wasting

1386
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
we're riding this we're just wasting
 

1387
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,149
we're riding this we're just wasting
time um as we're first starting out the

1388
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
time um as we're first starting out the
 

1389
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,390
time um as we're first starting out the
farm but once it's going once uh

1390
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
farm but once it's going once uh
 

1391
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,470
farm but once it's going once uh
the reaction is going

1392
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
the reaction is going
 

1393
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,470
the reaction is going
it'll be awesome there's a bullet biome

1394
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
it'll be awesome there's a bullet biome
 

1395
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,070
it'll be awesome there's a bullet biome
there let's see if this will get them

1396
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080

 

1397
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,110

1416
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679

 

1417
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,470

oh that's good

1418
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480

 

1419
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,750

all right so i think we got three or

1420
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
all right so i think we got three or
 

1421
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,510
all right so i think we got three or
four guys in there now so it's probably

1422
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
four guys in there now so it's probably
 

1423
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,110
four guys in there now so it's probably
safe we probably don't need to heal them

1424
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
safe we probably don't need to heal them
 

1425
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,590
safe we probably don't need to heal them
anymore

1426
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600

 

1427
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,029

1430
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
there's like four or five now every time
 

1431
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,549
there's like four or five now every time
i pass by here it's gonna

1432
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
i pass by here it's gonna
 

1433
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,990
i pass by here it's gonna
create more some of them are gonna start

1434
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
create more some of them are gonna start
 

1435
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,909

dying now though i think as well

1436
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
dying now though i think as well
 

1437
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,590
dying now though i think as well
uh basically they die just by shooting

1438
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
uh basically they die just by shooting
 

1439
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,510
uh basically they die just by shooting
each other cool cool all right so i

1440
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
each other cool cool all right so i
 

1441
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,789
each other cool cool all right so i
stepped out of the farm for a second

1442
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:20,799
stepped out of the farm for a second
 

1443
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,070
stepped out of the farm for a second
just to show you how it's looking from

1444
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
just to show you how it's looking from
 

1445
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,830
just to show you how it's looking from
the outside and i don't think i've shown

1446
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
the outside and i don't think i've shown
 

1447
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,750
the outside and i don't think i've shown
the water thing too well just yet but

1448
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
the water thing too well just yet but
 

1449
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,269
the water thing too well just yet but
basically it starts from the top and

1450
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
basically it starts from the top and
 

1451
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,190
basically it starts from the top and
flows all the way down

1452
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
flows all the way down
 

1453
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,070
flows all the way down
and any shulkers it passes on the way

1454
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
and any shulkers it passes on the way
 

1455
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,830
and any shulkers it passes on the way
they are forced to teleport that helps

1456
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
they are forced to teleport that helps
 

1457
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,590
they are forced to teleport that helps
to scatter them

1458
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
to scatter them
 

1459
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,110
to scatter them
and it also helps to get them back

1460
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
and it also helps to get them back
 

1461
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,870
and it also helps to get them back
inside so that they can take part of the

1462
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
inside so that they can take part of the
 

1463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,669
inside so that they can take part of the
reaction uh if they're needed if they're

1464
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
reaction uh if they're needed if they're
 

1465
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,430
reaction uh if they're needed if they're
not needed then they'll just die and get

1466
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
not needed then they'll just die and get
 

1467
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,789
not needed then they'll just die and get
the shells from them right um so the one

1468
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
the shells from them right um so the one
 

1469
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,470
the shells from them right um so the one
thing is it takes a very long time for

1470
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
thing is it takes a very long time for
 

1471
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,110
thing is it takes a very long time for
them to scatter to the two extreme ends

1472
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
them to scatter to the two extreme ends
 

1473
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,750
them to scatter to the two extreme ends
we still we only put one in the middle

1474
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
we still we only put one in the middle
 

1475
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,110
we still we only put one in the middle
and it's starting to get dense in the

1476
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
and it's starting to get dense in the
 

1477
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,470
and it's starting to get dense in the
middle like there's a lot of guys here

1478
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
middle like there's a lot of guys here
 

1479
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,549
middle like there's a lot of guys here
now but it's taking a long time for them

1480
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
now but it's taking a long time for them
 

1481
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,390
now but it's taking a long time for them
to spread

1482
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
to spread
 

1483
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,070
to spread
eventually the whole tubal gets filled

1484
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
eventually the whole tubal gets filled
 

1485
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,590
eventually the whole tubal gets filled
up though i think

1486
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
up though i think
 

1487
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,750
up though i think
um but this is about as dense as they

1488
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
um but this is about as dense as they
 

1489
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,230
um but this is about as dense as they
get before they start killing themselves

1490
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
get before they start killing themselves
 

1491
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,149
get before they start killing themselves
now to be honest with you i have no idea

1492
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
now to be honest with you i have no idea
 

1493
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,350
now to be honest with you i have no idea
what the rates are on this farm i

1494
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
what the rates are on this farm i
 

1495
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,870
what the rates are on this farm i
haven't really figured that out yet but

1496
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
haven't really figured that out yet but
 

1497
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,430
haven't really figured that out yet but
we got 24 so far just in kickstarting it

1498
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
we got 24 so far just in kickstarting it
 

1499
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,029
we got 24 so far just in kickstarting it
for a few minutes i'm guessing it's

1500
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
for a few minutes i'm guessing it's
 

1501
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,549
for a few minutes i'm guessing it's
probably gonna be a few stacks an hour

1502
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
probably gonna be a few stacks an hour
 

1503
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,149
probably gonna be a few stacks an hour
though um but we'll have to wait and see

1504
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
though um but we'll have to wait and see
 

1505
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,990
though um but we'll have to wait and see
i'm gonna be uh doing something here

1506
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
i'm gonna be uh doing something here
 

1507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,990
i'm gonna be uh doing something here
just kind of this experiment

1508
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
just kind of this experiment
 

1509
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,669
just kind of this experiment
uh so from here

1510
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
uh so from here
 

1511
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,390
uh so from here
i'm gonna count one two three four five

1512
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
i'm gonna count one two three four five
 

1513
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,149
i'm gonna count one two three four five
six seven eight

1514
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
six seven eight
 

1515
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,990
six seven eight
and then here we're gonna set up some

1516
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
and then here we're gonna set up some
 

1517
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,269
and then here we're gonna set up some
trap doors three of them i think

1518
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
trap doors three of them i think
 

1519
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,630
trap doors three of them i think
this is gonna go all the way up to the

1520
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
this is gonna go all the way up to the
 

1521
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,230
this is gonna go all the way up to the
sky

1522
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
sky
 

1523
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,990
sky
now the reason for this is a little hard

1524
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
now the reason for this is a little hard
 

1525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,390
now the reason for this is a little hard
to explain but basically they're going

1526
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
to explain but basically they're going
 

1527
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,470
to explain but basically they're going
to be like this right

1528
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
to be like this right
 

1529
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,950
to be like this right
these are this this is the only surface

1530
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
these are this this is the only surface
 

1531
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,710
these are this this is the only surface
this front part that the chalkers can

1532
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
this front part that the chalkers can
 

1533
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,390
this front part that the chalkers can
teleport to they can't teleport to the

1534
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
teleport to they can't teleport to the
 

1535
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,990
teleport to they can't teleport to the
sides of the trapdoors or the back of it

1536
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
sides of the trapdoors or the back of it
 

1537
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,870
sides of the trapdoors or the back of it
just this front part and it's outside of

1538
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
just this front part and it's outside of
 

1539
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,149
just this front part and it's outside of
the range

1540
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:58,159
the range
 

1541
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,470
the range
of the shulkers to teleport to when they

1542
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
of the shulkers to teleport to when they
 

1543
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,310
of the shulkers to teleport to when they
are inside the reactor but when they're

1544
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
are inside the reactor but when they're
 

1545
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,470
are inside the reactor but when they're
on the outside here they can either

1546
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
on the outside here they can either
 

1547
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,549
on the outside here they can either
teleport inside the reactor or onto the

1548
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
teleport inside the reactor or onto the
 

1549
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,310
teleport inside the reactor or onto the
trap doors there and those are gonna act

1550
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
trap doors there and those are gonna act
 

1551
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,950
trap doors there and those are gonna act
as sort of like a backup emergency in

1552
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
as sort of like a backup emergency in
 

1553
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,950
as sort of like a backup emergency in
case something goes wrong

1554
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
case something goes wrong
 

1555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,269
case something goes wrong
but also they might work as an overdrive

1556
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
but also they might work as an overdrive
 

1557
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,350
but also they might work as an overdrive
system where we can flood the trap doors

1558
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
system where we can flood the trap doors
 

1559
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,549
system where we can flood the trap doors
and they'll send like hundreds of

1560
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:20,559
and they'll send like hundreds of
 

1561
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,029
and they'll send like hundreds of
shulkers inside yeah i gotta say shocker

1562
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
shulkers inside yeah i gotta say shocker
 

1563
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,789
shulkers inside yeah i gotta say shocker
farms are actually pretty complicated

1564
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
farms are actually pretty complicated
 

1565
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,029
farms are actually pretty complicated
there's a lot of like

1566
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
there's a lot of like
 

1567
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,710
there's a lot of like
careful maneuvering you need to do with

1568
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
careful maneuvering you need to do with
 

1569
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,110
careful maneuvering you need to do with
them they're very prone to problems

1570
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
them they're very prone to problems
 

1571
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,390
them they're very prone to problems
uh but the idea with this the

1572
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,400
uh but the idea with this the
 

1573
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,669
uh but the idea with this the
duplications only happen inside the

1574
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
duplications only happen inside the
 

1575
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,350
duplications only happen inside the
reactor there

1576
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
reactor there
 

1577
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,390
reactor there
and every shocker within eight blocks of

1578
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
and every shocker within eight blocks of
 

1579
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,149
and every shocker within eight blocks of
a duplication happening

1580
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
a duplication happening
 

1581
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,149
a duplication happening
lowers the chance by 20

1582
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
lowers the chance by 20
 

1583
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:44,950
lowers the chance by 20
so

1584
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
so
 

1585
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,269
so
when it's densely packed like that

1586
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
when it's densely packed like that
 

1587
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,909
when it's densely packed like that
duplications happen rarely it's not good

1588
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
duplications happen rarely it's not good
 

1589
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,190
duplications happen rarely it's not good
so what we're trying to do with this

1590
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
so what we're trying to do with this
 

1591
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,789
so what we're trying to do with this
inside the reactor when a duplication

1592
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
inside the reactor when a duplication
 

1593
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,390
inside the reactor when a duplication
happens

1594
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
happens
 

1595
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,470
happens
the full health guy stays inside the

1596
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
the full health guy stays inside the
 

1597
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,549
the full health guy stays inside the
reactor and the guy that got hit

1598
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
reactor and the guy that got hit
 

1599
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,630
reactor and the guy that got hit
teleports on the outside

1600
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
teleports on the outside
 

1601
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,230
teleports on the outside
of the reactor or he might teleport

1602
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
of the reactor or he might teleport
 

1603
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,750
of the reactor or he might teleport
inside as well

1604
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
inside as well
 

1605
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,990
inside as well
if he's on the outside ideally we want

1606
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
if he's on the outside ideally we want
 

1607
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,350
if he's on the outside ideally we want
to get rid of him

1608
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
to get rid of him
 

1609
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,950
to get rid of him
because he's low health

1610
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
because he's low health
 

1611
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,350
because he's low health
he's unlikely to duplicate again

1612
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,360
he's unlikely to duplicate again
 

1613
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,110
he's unlikely to duplicate again
so we're trying to send them to these

1614
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
so we're trying to send them to these
 

1615
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,430
so we're trying to send them to these
trap door outer rings

1616
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
trap door outer rings
 

1617
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,430
trap door outer rings
and because it's a double hop he hops

1618
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
and because it's a double hop he hops
 

1619
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,510
and because it's a double hop he hops
once from inside to the outside ring and

1620
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
once from inside to the outside ring and
 

1621
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,350
once from inside to the outside ring and
then from the outside ring to the trap

1622
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
then from the outside ring to the trap
 

1623
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,389
then from the outside ring to the trap
door

1624
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
door
 

1625
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,870
door
it's far enough away on these trap doors

1626
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
it's far enough away on these trap doors
 

1627
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,789
it's far enough away on these trap doors
that it has no interference on the

1628
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
that it has no interference on the
 

1629
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,990
that it has no interference on the
duplication rates inside the reactor

1630
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
duplication rates inside the reactor
 

1631
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,430
duplication rates inside the reactor
so we're going to store as many as we

1632
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
so we're going to store as many as we
 

1633
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,350
so we're going to store as many as we
want on these trapdoors

1634
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
want on these trapdoors
 

1635
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,789
want on these trapdoors
and then since they're all kind of low

1636
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
and then since they're all kind of low
 

1637
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,070
and then since they're all kind of low
health guys

1638
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
health guys
 

1639
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,230
health guys
once we get a bunch of them

1640
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
once we get a bunch of them
 

1641
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,630
once we get a bunch of them
we can just send a water

1642
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
we can just send a water
 

1643
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,350
we can just send a water
uh fall down it'll wash them all off

1644
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
uh fall down it'll wash them all off
 

1645
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,350
uh fall down it'll wash them all off
onto the outside of the ring

1646
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
onto the outside of the ring
 

1647
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,149
onto the outside of the ring
and then that waterfall will wash them

1648
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
and then that waterfall will wash them
 

1649
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,389
and then that waterfall will wash them
onto the inside most likely

1650
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
onto the inside most likely
 

1651
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,350
onto the inside most likely
so

1652
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360
so
 

1653
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,750
so
then we're gonna have a massacre

1654
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:55,760
then we're gonna have a massacre
 

1655
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,510
then we're gonna have a massacre
is the basic idea with all the low

1656
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
is the basic idea with all the low
 

1657
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,870
is the basic idea with all the low
health guys

1658
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
health guys
 

1659
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,110
health guys
is how i foresee it working i haven't

1660
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
is how i foresee it working i haven't
 

1661
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,350
is how i foresee it working i haven't
tried it yet but that's my plan

1662
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360

 

1663
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,269

anyways i don't think we're gonna see

1664
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
anyways i don't think we're gonna see
 

1665
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,710
anyways i don't think we're gonna see
anything like that happening today

1666
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
anything like that happening today
 

1667
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,630
anything like that happening today
though i gotta run the farm for quite a

1668
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
though i gotta run the farm for quite a
 

1669
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,350
though i gotta run the farm for quite a
while before something like that happens

1670
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
while before something like that happens
 

1671
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,909
while before something like that happens
but we did get all the trap doors in and

1672
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:15,919
but we did get all the trap doors in and
 

1673
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,269
but we did get all the trap doors in and
i think i'm gonna go inside there and

1674
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
i think i'm gonna go inside there and
 

1675
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,710
i think i'm gonna go inside there and
just run it for a while and just make

1676
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
just run it for a while and just make
 

1677
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,389
just run it for a while and just make
sure they're actually teleporting onto

1678
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
sure they're actually teleporting onto
 

1679
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,669
sure they're actually teleporting onto
the trap doors and then we'll probably

1680
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
the trap doors and then we'll probably
 

1681
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,750
the trap doors and then we'll probably
have to wrap up for today and before we

1682
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
have to wrap up for today and before we
 

1683
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,110
have to wrap up for today and before we
wrap up here maybe i'll mention a few

1684
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
wrap up here maybe i'll mention a few
 

1685
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,110
wrap up here maybe i'll mention a few
more details about how this farm works

1686
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
more details about how this farm works
 

1687
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,870
more details about how this farm works
so if you're wondering why we're not

1688
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
so if you're wondering why we're not
 

1689
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,310
so if you're wondering why we're not
getting shot

1690
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
getting shot
 

1691
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,909
getting shot
it's because

1692
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
it's because
 

1693
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,669
it's because
like there's nothing blocking the boats

1694
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
like there's nothing blocking the boats
 

1695
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,669
like there's nothing blocking the boats
from hitting us but we're just moving so

1696
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
from hitting us but we're just moving so
 

1697
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,350
from hitting us but we're just moving so
fast through this that they can't really

1698
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
fast through this that they can't really
 

1699
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,029
fast through this that they can't really
catch up to us

1700
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
catch up to us
 

1701
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,630
catch up to us
which so they just kind of follow the

1702
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
which so they just kind of follow the
 

1703
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,830
which so they just kind of follow the
sides here which works out pretty

1704
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
sides here which works out pretty
 

1705
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,029
sides here which works out pretty
awesome uh also

1706
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
awesome uh also
 

1707
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,029
awesome uh also
it works better on the downward than the

1708
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
it works better on the downward than the
 

1709
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,789
it works better on the downward than the
upward the upward works a little bit

1710
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
upward the upward works a little bit
 

1711
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,149
upward the upward works a little bit
like they'll still hit each other a few

1712
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
like they'll still hit each other a few
 

1713
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,389
like they'll still hit each other a few
times but we go by a little too quickly

1714
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
times but we go by a little too quickly
 

1715
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,830
times but we go by a little too quickly
that way

1716
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
that way
 

1717
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,430
that way
but we have to get back up to the top

1718
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
but we have to get back up to the top
 

1719
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,430
but we have to get back up to the top
somehow so i figured let's just do it

1720
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
somehow so i figured let's just do it
 

1721
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,110
somehow so i figured let's just do it
inside the farm

1722
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
inside the farm
 

1723
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,389
inside the farm
and you'll notice like the bullets kind

1724
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
and you'll notice like the bullets kind
 

1725
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,630
and you'll notice like the bullets kind
of hang around for quite a while

1726
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
of hang around for quite a while
 

1727
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,389
of hang around for quite a while
so they can kind of like build up and

1728
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
so they can kind of like build up and
 

1729
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,870
so they can kind of like build up and
then like shock on these guys and create

1730
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
then like shock on these guys and create
 

1731
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,230
then like shock on these guys and create
a bunch of duplications at once

1732
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
a bunch of duplications at once
 

1733
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,430
a bunch of duplications at once
sometimes

1734
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
sometimes
 

1735
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,190
sometimes
which is cool the other thing you'll

1736
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
which is cool the other thing you'll
 

1737
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,510
which is cool the other thing you'll
notice is we're losing food because

1738
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
notice is we're losing food because
 

1739
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,389
notice is we're losing food because
we're traveling so far here where i

1740
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
we're traveling so far here where i
 

1741
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,990
we're traveling so far here where i
think it counts as swimming maybe and

1742
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
think it counts as swimming maybe and
 

1743
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,149
think it counts as swimming maybe and
swimming takes up hunger

1744
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
swimming takes up hunger
 

1745
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,830
swimming takes up hunger
so eventually we'll run out of food if

1746
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
so eventually we'll run out of food if
 

1747
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,389
so eventually we'll run out of food if
we can this and then we're in trouble

1748
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
we can this and then we're in trouble
 

1749
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,470
we can this and then we're in trouble
right well we can also set up a regen

1750
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
right well we can also set up a regen
 

1751
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,950
right well we can also set up a regen
beacon and that counteracts the food

1752
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
