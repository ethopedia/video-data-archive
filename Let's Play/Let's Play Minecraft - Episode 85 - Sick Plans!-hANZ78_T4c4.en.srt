next part of building my base here is

62
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
next part of building my base here is
 

63
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,340
next part of building my base here is
setting up the spawning pads maybe we'll

64
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,350
setting up the spawning pads maybe we'll
 

65
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,780
setting up the spawning pads maybe we'll
go over to that spiral over there first

66
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:01,790
go over to that spiral over there first
 

67
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,030
go over to that spiral over there first
talk about that so all the grass is gone

68
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
talk about that so all the grass is gone
 

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,419
talk about that so all the grass is gone
now pretty much there's a few loose

70
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,429
now pretty much there's a few loose
 

71
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,960
now pretty much there's a few loose
grass blocks still in that junk which

72
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:11,970
grass blocks still in that junk which
 

73
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,530
grass blocks still in that junk which
will disappear when I for

74
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,540
will disappear when I for
 

75
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,289
will disappear when I for
use it over but most of it's over here

76
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:16,299
use it over but most of it's over here
 

77
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,539
use it over but most of it's over here
now so this is where all the mobs are

78
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:18,549
now so this is where all the mobs are
 

79
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,869
now so this is where all the mobs are
spawning pretty much for the passive

80
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:21,879
spawning pretty much for the passive
 

81
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,390
spawning pretty much for the passive
mobs and I just need to run the grass up

82
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
mobs and I just need to run the grass up
 

83
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,339
mobs and I just need to run the grass up
high because the spawning pads are gonna

84
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:29,349
high because the spawning pads are gonna
 

85
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,479
high because the spawning pads are gonna
go up high like they were in the Alpha

86
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:33,489
go up high like they were in the Alpha
 

87
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,179
go up high like they were in the Alpha
base so that's what the spirals for just

88
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:39,189
base so that's what the spirals for just
 

89
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,949
base so that's what the spirals for just
to bring the grass up it takes grass a

90
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
to bring the grass up it takes grass a
 

91
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,819
to bring the grass up it takes grass a
long long time to spread not really any

92
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:44,829
long long time to spread not really any
 

93
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:53,069
long long time to spread not really any
shortcuts ie a stupid healthy Pig he was

94
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:53,079
shortcuts ie a stupid healthy Pig he was
 

95
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,409
shortcuts ie a stupid healthy Pig he was
a sick Pig I woulda let him live so it's

96
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:58,419
a sick Pig I woulda let him live so it's
 

97
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,110
a sick Pig I woulda let him live so it's
got a ways to go here yet when running

98
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
got a ways to go here yet when running
 

99
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,539
got a ways to go here yet when running
grass up though I strongly recommend you

100
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:03,549
grass up though I strongly recommend you
 

101
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,190
grass up though I strongly recommend you
do this bigger spiral method let's go

102
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,200
do this bigger spiral method let's go
 

103
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:18,540
do this bigger spiral method let's go
down I'll try to explain why

104
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,550

 

105
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,699

so the way I set this up is I just built

106
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:21,709
so the way I set this up is I just built
 

107
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:29,910
so the way I set this up is I just built
like a two-by-two tower up into the sky

108
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920

 

109
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,180

and put lights up it's when I had it all

110
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,190
and put lights up it's when I had it all
 

111
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,080
and put lights up it's when I had it all
hollowed out okay good enough so what I

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,090
hollowed out okay good enough so what I
 

113
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,979
hollowed out okay good enough so what I
did is I had it up like this started

114
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:41,989
did is I had it up like this started
 

115
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:52,990
did is I had it up like this started
digging down making this spiral connect

116
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
digging down making this spiral connect
 

117
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,979
digging down making this spiral connect
at the bottom with the grass I had there

118
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:55,989
at the bottom with the grass I had there
 

119
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,449
at the bottom with the grass I had there
but if you try to run grass up that

120
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:58,459
but if you try to run grass up that
 

121
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,350
but if you try to run grass up that
it'll take

122
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
it'll take
 

123
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,390
it'll take
I don't know years it'll take forever so

124
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
I don't know years it'll take forever so
 

125
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,750
I don't know years it'll take forever so
the next thing I did is I just made this

126
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
the next thing I did is I just made this
 

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,539
the next thing I did is I just made this
wider I went like this this is how I did

128
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:13,549
wider I went like this this is how I did
 

129
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,219
wider I went like this this is how I did
the spiral and that'll get the grass up

130
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:18,229
the spiral and that'll get the grass up
 

131
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:24,400
the spiral and that'll get the grass up
a lot faster if your soil is wider and

132
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,410
a lot faster if your soil is wider and
 

133
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,080
a lot faster if your soil is wider and
you do that all the way to the top

134
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,090
you do that all the way to the top
 

135
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,020
you do that all the way to the top
and make sure you have torches otherwise

136
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,030
and make sure you have torches otherwise
 

137
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,279
and make sure you have torches otherwise
the grass won't spread probably although

138
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,289
the grass won't spread probably although
 

139
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:40,990
the grass won't spread probably although
in the might I don't know okay so that's

140
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,000
in the might I don't know okay so that's
 

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,400
in the might I don't know okay so that's
how I am moving the grass up you can see

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,410
how I am moving the grass up you can see
 

143
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,279
how I am moving the grass up you can see
cow just spawned up there so it's gonna

144
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,289
cow just spawned up there so it's gonna
 

145
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:53,129
cow just spawned up there so it's gonna
work out pretty good when it's all done

146
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:53,139

 

147
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,460

the plan for this ice base here is to

148
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:57,470
the plan for this ice base here is to
 

149
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,690
the plan for this ice base here is to
build five different mob systems

150
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:00,700
build five different mob systems
 

151
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,360
build five different mob systems
okay so there's gonna be a squid system

152
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,370
okay so there's gonna be a squid system
 

153
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,450
okay so there's gonna be a squid system
I'll probably do that last because it's

154
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,460
I'll probably do that last because it's
 

155
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,210
I'll probably do that last because it's
the most work I think it'll be a slime

156
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,220
the most work I think it'll be a slime
 

157
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,800
the most work I think it'll be a slime
system for collecting slimes I have a

158
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:14,810
system for collecting slimes I have a
 

159
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,040
system for collecting slimes I have a
good idea in mind that's unique that I

160
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,050
good idea in mind that's unique that I
 

161
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,000
good idea in mind that's unique that I
haven't seen before

162
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,010
haven't seen before
 

163
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,400
haven't seen before
and it should be pretty effective so I'm

164
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,410
and it should be pretty effective so I'm
 

165
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,719
and it should be pretty effective so I'm
excited to do that sometime so we get

166
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:25,729
excited to do that sometime so we get
 

167
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,080
excited to do that sometime so we get
squid slime there'll also be the passive

168
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,090
squid slime there'll also be the passive
 

169
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,410
squid slime there'll also be the passive
mob system

170
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:31,420
mob system
 

171
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,540
mob system
haven't fully decided how I'm gonna do

172
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:33,550
haven't fully decided how I'm gonna do
 

173
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,840
haven't fully decided how I'm gonna do
that yet I'll probably make it similar

174
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:36,850
that yet I'll probably make it similar
 

175
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,370
that yet I'll probably make it similar
to the one I have on

176
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,380
to the one I have on
 

177
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,240
to the one I have on
chocolate island the only difference is

178
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,250
chocolate island the only difference is
 

179
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,390
chocolate island the only difference is
I would like to although be two main

180
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,400
I would like to although be two main
 

181
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,630
I would like to although be two main
differences number one I won't use the

182
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:48,640
differences number one I won't use the
 

183
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,790
differences number one I won't use the
canal system like I have with the water

184
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
canal system like I have with the water
 

185
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,100
canal system like I have with the water
stairs and sign trick that I came up

186
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,110
stairs and sign trick that I came up
 

187
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,610
stairs and sign trick that I came up
with I won't be using that because

188
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:58,620
with I won't be using that because
 

189
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,120
with I won't be using that because
checking you got stuck in the stairs so

190
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,130
checking you got stuck in the stairs so
 

191
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,530
checking you got stuck in the stairs so
I'm gonna use a different method for the

192
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:04,540
I'm gonna use a different method for the
 

193
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm gonna use a different method for the
canals and also for the spawning pads I

194
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,410
canals and also for the spawning pads I
 

195
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,710
canals and also for the spawning pads I
would like to have it on off for the

196
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
would like to have it on off for the
 

197
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
would like to have it on off for the
passing lobs and the only way of doing

198
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,090
passing lobs and the only way of doing
 

199
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,980
passing lobs and the only way of doing
that is water really so I need come up

200
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:19,990
that is water really so I need come up
 

201
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,650
that is water really so I need come up
with a design that the water will spread

202
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:22,660
with a design that the water will spread
 

203
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,300
with a design that the water will spread
evenly over all the pads if you have a

204
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,310
evenly over all the pads if you have a
 

205
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,220
evenly over all the pads if you have a
square though it doesn't do that

206
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,230
square though it doesn't do that
 

207
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,410
square though it doesn't do that
it's a problem and I like to use the six

208
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:34,420
it's a problem and I like to use the six
 

209
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,530
it's a problem and I like to use the six
by six pads ideally but I don't think

210
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:40,540
by six pads ideally but I don't think
 

211
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,950
by six pads ideally but I don't think
the water will cooperate with that too

212
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:43,960
the water will cooperate with that too
 

213
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,710
the water will cooperate with that too
well so I might have to make a diamond

214
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
well so I might have to make a diamond
 

215
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,370
well so I might have to make a diamond
shape possibly or I may just skip to the

216
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:50,380
shape possibly or I may just skip to the
 

217
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:58,070
shape possibly or I may just skip to the
idea of having an on/off with water

218
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080

 

219
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,290

okay so this is kind of these four

220
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,300
okay so this is kind of these four
 

221
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,260
okay so this is kind of these four
blocks or the center you place water on

222
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,270
blocks or the center you place water on
 

223
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,310
blocks or the center you place water on
them though it won't spread all over

224
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,320
them though it won't spread all over
 

225
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,100
them though it won't spread all over
take the shortest route down so

226
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,110
take the shortest route down so
 

227
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,310
take the shortest route down so
gonna be a problem another way to do

228
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,320
gonna be a problem another way to do
 

229
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,770
gonna be a problem another way to do
something like roboticus did is having

230
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:19,780
something like roboticus did is having
 

231
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,890
something like roboticus did is having
signs all the way on the outside hold

232
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:22,900
signs all the way on the outside hold
 

233
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,810
signs all the way on the outside hold
the water in and still let the mob's

234
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:24,820
the water in and still let the mob's
 

235
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,800
the water in and still let the mob's
pass through but that seems like more

236
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,810
pass through but that seems like more
 

237
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,960
pass through but that seems like more
work than I'm willing to put into the

238
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:30,970
work than I'm willing to put into the
 

239
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,070
work than I'm willing to put into the
idea so probably either be a diamond

240
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,080
idea so probably either be a diamond
 

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,040
idea so probably either be a diamond
shape or I'll just forget about having

242
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,050
shape or I'll just forget about having
 

243
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,380
shape or I'll just forget about having
an on/off

244
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,390
an on/off
 

245
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,910
an on/off
okay so squid slime passive mobs and

246
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:43,920
okay so squid slime passive mobs and
 

247
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,530
okay so squid slime passive mobs and
then there's gonna be two hostile mob

248
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:46,540
then there's gonna be two hostile mob
 

249
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,760
then there's gonna be two hostile mob
systems the first one's gonna be pretty

250
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:50,770
systems the first one's gonna be pretty
 

251
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,380
systems the first one's gonna be pretty
much the same as the one I'm using now

252
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,390
much the same as the one I'm using now
 

253
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,390
much the same as the one I'm using now
this is my favorite it's a 6x6 pad and

254
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,400
this is my favorite it's a 6x6 pad and
 

255
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,210
this is my favorite it's a 6x6 pad and
then I have these four half slabs to

256
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,220
then I have these four half slabs to
 

257
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,500
then I have these four half slabs to
prevent spiders from spawning when

258
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,510
prevent spiders from spawning when
 

259
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,060
prevent spiders from spawning when
Pistons came out I had the idea of

260
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,070
Pistons came out I had the idea of
 

261
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,860
Pistons came out I had the idea of
attaching Pistons to the half slabs and

262
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:09,870
attaching Pistons to the half slabs and
 

263
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,270
attaching Pistons to the half slabs and
retracting these so that I could turn

264
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,280
retracting these so that I could turn
 

265
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,940
retracting these so that I could turn
spiders spawning on and off when I

266
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:14,950
spiders spawning on and off when I
 

267
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,130
spiders spawning on and off when I
attempted the wire though I deem up on

268
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,140
attempted the wire though I deem up on
 

269
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,870
attempted the wire though I deem up on
the idea because it just seemed like a

270
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:18,880
the idea because it just seemed like a
 

271
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,080
the idea because it just seemed like a
huge hassle but then it wasn't long

272
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,090
huge hassle but then it wasn't long
 

273
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,870
huge hassle but then it wasn't long
after that my viewers start sending me

274
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:24,880
after that my viewers start sending me
 

275
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,240
after that my viewers start sending me
video responses with the idea as well

276
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,250
video responses with the idea as well
 

277
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,670
video responses with the idea as well
and they actually showed how to wire it

278
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
and they actually showed how to wire it
 

279
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,290
and they actually showed how to wire it
so kind of regained my interest in it

280
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,300
so kind of regained my interest in it
 

281
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,350
so kind of regained my interest in it
and that it'll probably use it

282
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
and that it'll probably use it
 

283
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,070
and that it'll probably use it
unfortunately it was a long time ago

284
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,080
unfortunately it was a long time ago
 

285
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,440
unfortunately it was a long time ago
that people said to me these video

286
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,450
that people said to me these video
 

287
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,080
that people said to me these video
responses so don't remember who it was

288
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,090
responses so don't remember who it was
 

289
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,060
responses so don't remember who it was
but if you want you can send them again

290
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,070
but if you want you can send them again
 

291
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,460
but if you want you can send them again
to this video and that way you can get

292
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,470
to this video and that way you can get
 

293
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,860
to this video and that way you can get
credit that you deserve I did change the

294
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:55,870
credit that you deserve I did change the
 

295
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,300
credit that you deserve I did change the
wiring though from what they showed me

296
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,310
wiring though from what they showed me
 

297
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,610
wiring though from what they showed me
this is how I'm doing it I think and

298
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:04,620
this is how I'm doing it I think and
 

299
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,540
this is how I'm doing it I think and
probably just have a redstone torch

300
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,550
probably just have a redstone torch
 

301
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,150
probably just have a redstone torch
underneath somewhere here and then have

302
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
underneath somewhere here and then have
 

303
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,790
underneath somewhere here and then have
canals on the outside here the wiring

304
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
canals on the outside here the wiring
 

305
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,420
canals on the outside here the wiring
has to go underneath the canals which is

306
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,430
has to go underneath the canals which is
 

307
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:25,640
has to go underneath the canals which is
the main issue oops

308
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:25,650

 

309
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,790

okay so I need a break again one sec so

310
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
okay so I need a break again one sec so
 

311
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,470
okay so I need a break again one sec so
I'll have the spider option on/off and I

312
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll have the spider option on/off and I
 

313
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,390
I'll have the spider option on/off and I
also plan on setting up a light system

314
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,400
also plan on setting up a light system
 

315
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,080
also plan on setting up a light system
for above each of these pads to turn

316
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,090
for above each of these pads to turn
 

317
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,450
for above each of these pads to turn
hostile mob spawns on or off as well in

318
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,460
hostile mob spawns on or off as well in
 

319
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,460
hostile mob spawns on or off as well in
the system so this should work out

spiders if you want or not this one you
 

371
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,700
spiders if you want or not this one you
don't have any option for that this one

372
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:19,710
don't have any option for that this one
 

373
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,780
don't have any option for that this one
this is the one I'm gonna be hooking up

374
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:21,790
this is the one I'm gonna be hooking up
 

375
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,110
this is the one I'm gonna be hooking up
to the EMP units so I'll be able to do

376
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
to the EMP units so I'll be able to do
 

377
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,250
to the EMP units so I'll be able to do
different things with that feature

378
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,260
different things with that feature
 

379
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,460
different things with that feature
with this style you can manipulate mobs

380
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,470
with this style you can manipulate mobs
 

381
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,290
with this style you can manipulate mobs
while they're still alive while with

while they're still alive while with
 

383
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,210
while they're still alive while with
this one you pretty much have to kill

384
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,220
this one you pretty much have to kill
 

385
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,910
this one you pretty much have to kill
them instantly nothing special you can

386
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
them instantly nothing special you can
 

387
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,960
them instantly nothing special you can
do with them and you know stuff like

388
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:41,970
do with them and you know stuff like
 

389
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,000
do with them and you know stuff like
that another big thing this 6x6 by let's

390
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,010
that another big thing this 6x6 by let's
 

391
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,500
that another big thing this 6x6 by let's
say three high pad has 32 blocks that

392
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:51,510
say three high pad has 32 blocks that
 

393
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,570
say three high pad has 32 blocks that
mobs can spawn on and by comparison this

394
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:55,580
mobs can spawn on and by comparison this
 

395
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:05,540
mobs can spawn on and by comparison this
7 by 3 by 8 long section here there's

396
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:05,550
7 by 3 by 8 long section here there's
 

397
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,470
7 by 3 by 8 long section here there's
only 16 spots that mobs can spawn on so

398
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,480
only 16 spots that mobs can spawn on so
 

399
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,610
only 16 spots that mobs can spawn on so
this one's way bigger and it has less

400
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:13,620
this one's way bigger and it has less
 

401
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,870
this one's way bigger and it has less
sin well has half the spawning space so

402
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:19,880
sin well has half the spawning space so
 

403
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,640
sin well has half the spawning space so
yeah that's a disadvantage I also plan

404
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:22,650
yeah that's a disadvantage I also plan
 

405
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,100
yeah that's a disadvantage I also plan
on oops

406
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,110
on oops
 

407
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,660
on oops
putting a light system in here as well

408
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,670
putting a light system in here as well
 

409
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,660
putting a light system in here as well
and I will only have one of them going

410
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:29,670
and I will only have one of them going
 

411
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,100
and I will only have one of them going
at a time so if I want to click

412
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,110
at a time so if I want to click
 

413
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,130
at a time so if I want to click
gunpowder this one will be on if I want

414
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,140
gunpowder this one will be on if I want
 

415
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,230
gunpowder this one will be on if I want
them to go to the EMP unit this one will

416
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
them to go to the EMP unit this one will
 

417
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,060
them to go to the EMP unit this one will
be on it's a plan acid mob system and

418
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,070
be on it's a plan acid mob system and
 

419
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,590
be on it's a plan acid mob system and
both these hostile mob systems are gonna

420
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
both these hostile mob systems are gonna
 

421
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
both these hostile mob systems are gonna
be built up in the air but like 30

422
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:48,810
be built up in the air but like 30
 

423
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,150
be built up in the air but like 30
blocks are so high above the middle of

424
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
blocks are so high above the middle of
 

425
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,120
blocks are so high above the middle of
my base here and that's so I can take

426
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,130
my base here and that's so I can take
 

427
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,180
my base here and that's so I can take
advantage of gravity I still do

428
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,190
advantage of gravity I still do
 

429
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,110
advantage of gravity I still do
recommend the hostile mob system I use

430
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
recommend the hostile mob system I use
 

431
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,760
recommend the hostile mob system I use
on chocolate island if you want a

432
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:07,770
on chocolate island if you want a
 

433
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,720

the nice thing about it is you gain

436
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,170
the nice thing about it is you gain
 

437
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,750
the nice thing about it is you gain
resources when you're digging it out

438
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
resources when you're digging it out
 

439
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,240
resources when you're digging it out
it's easy to set up you know and it you

440
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,250
it's easy to set up you know and it you
 

441
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,550
it's easy to set up you know and it you
don't have an ugly spawning pad up in

442
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
don't have an ugly spawning pad up in
 

443
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,640
don't have an ugly spawning pad up in
the air you know messing up the look of

444
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:22,650
the air you know messing up the look of
 

445
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,060
the air you know messing up the look of
your base if you go with the system I

446
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,070
your base if you go with the system I
 

447
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,700
your base if you go with the system I
use on chocolate island after you build

448
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:28,710
use on chocolate island after you build
 

449
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,950
use on chocolate island after you build
one in the air though a sky trap style

450
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:32,960
one in the air though a sky trap style
 

451
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,450
one in the air though a sky trap style
the advantage is you don't need to use a

452
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:35,460
the advantage is you don't need to use a
 

453
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,030
the advantage is you don't need to use a
mob Vader which takes time for them to

454
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
mob Vader which takes time for them to
 

455
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,790
mob Vader which takes time for them to
swim up you can just drop them down no

456
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
swim up you can just drop them down no
 

457
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,750
swim up you can just drop them down no
problem so

458
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
problem so
 

459
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,160
problem so
most instant so it's much more efficient

460
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,170
most instant so it's much more efficient
 

461
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,420
most instant so it's much more efficient
because he can kill the mobs quicker

462
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,430
because he can kill the mobs quicker
 

463
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,880
because he can kill the mobs quicker
doing that but you know they each have

464
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:52,890
doing that but you know they each have
 

465
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,950
doing that but you know they each have
their advantages and disadvantages use

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,390

of course they're freezing right now

482
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:23,400
of course they're freezing right now
 

483
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,840
of course they're freezing right now
because there's no floor over this this

484
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:26,850
because there's no floor over this this
 

485
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,070
because there's no floor over this this
will be too high in here flip the floor

486
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,080
will be too high in here flip the floor
 

487
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,990
will be too high in here flip the floor
over it

488
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
over it
 

489
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,730
over it
so that I can still come down here and

490
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:34,740
so that I can still come down here and
 

491
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,130
so that I can still come down here and
do maintenance if I need to and I have

492
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,140
do maintenance if I need to and I have
 

493
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,920
do maintenance if I need to and I have
all these piston things set up and they

494
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:42,930
all these piston things set up and they
 

495
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,810
all these piston things set up and they
turned out really well

496
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:46,820

 

497
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,490

waters on waters off let's see a working

498
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,500
waters on waters off let's see a working
 

499
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,560
waters on waters off let's see a working
one with a fake floor here this is a

500
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:57,570
one with a fake floor here this is a
 

501
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,270
one with a fake floor here this is a
block that moves these barriers are open

502
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,280
block that moves these barriers are open
 

503
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,550
block that moves these barriers are open
so the water is free to flow a big

504
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
so the water is free to flow a big
 

505
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,740
so the water is free to flow a big
concern of many of my viewers was that

506
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:06,750
concern of many of my viewers was that
 

507
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,240
concern of many of my viewers was that
the water was going to destroy the

508
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,250
the water was going to destroy the
 

509
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,480
the water was going to destroy the
levers I was also worried about this but

510
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,490
levers I was also worried about this but
 

511
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,800
levers I was also worried about this but
there's a trick to it if you timed this

512
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,810
there's a trick to it if you timed this
 

513
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:22,640
there's a trick to it if you timed this
block moving just right oh nothing wrong

514
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:22,650
block moving just right oh nothing wrong
 

515
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,800
block moving just right oh nothing wrong
there is it gonna flood it does a little

516
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:27,810
there is it gonna flood it does a little
 

517
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,300
there is it gonna flood it does a little
bit but it doesn't wreck anything so

518
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,310
bit but it doesn't wreck anything so
 

519
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:37,010
bit but it doesn't wreck anything so
that turned out perfect why this works

520
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,020
that turned out perfect why this works
 

521
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,850
that turned out perfect why this works
is a little bit complicated should I

522
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:40,860
is a little bit complicated should I
 

523
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,700
is a little bit complicated should I
attempt to explain it yeah I'll do my

524
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:46,710
attempt to explain it yeah I'll do my
 

525
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,700
attempt to explain it yeah I'll do my
best here

526
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:49,710

 

527
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,010

okay so the water is right above here

528
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,020
okay so the water is right above here
 

529
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,670
okay so the water is right above here
right behind this piston so it needs to

530
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:58,680
right behind this piston so it needs to
 

531
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,500
right behind this piston so it needs to
move one block to where that piston is

532
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,510
move one block to where that piston is
 

533
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,570
move one block to where that piston is
then over one more that's two three four

534
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:04,580
then over one more that's two three four
 

535
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:10,340
then over one more that's two three four
five so five blocks movement over here

536
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,350
five so five blocks movement over here
 

537
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,199
five so five blocks movement over here
is equivalent to twenty five ticks

538
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,209
is equivalent to twenty five ticks
 

539
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:22,160
is equivalent to twenty five ticks
because water moves five ticks each time

540
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,170
because water moves five ticks each time
 

541
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,090
because water moves five ticks each time
ooh not doing well on the explaining

542
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,100
ooh not doing well on the explaining
 

543
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,199
ooh not doing well on the explaining
here okay time it takes water stream to

544
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:30,209
here okay time it takes water stream to
 

545
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:34,280
here okay time it takes water stream to
move over one block is five ticks so

546
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,290
move over one block is five ticks so
 

547
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,750
move over one block is five ticks so
here is five five block changes here is

548
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:38,760
here is five five block changes here is
 

549
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,730
here is five five block changes here is
six so that's 30 ticks okay if we go

550
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:43,740
six so that's 30 ticks okay if we go
 

551
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,030
six so that's 30 ticks okay if we go
around to the back here the way I have

552
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
around to the back here the way I have
 

553
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,410
around to the back here the way I have
it wired the lever for the water control

554
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,420
it wired the lever for the water control
 

555
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,500
it wired the lever for the water control
is over behind the snow block here goes

556
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,510
is over behind the snow block here goes
 

557
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,160
is over behind the snow block here goes
over excellent activates the piston to

558
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,170
over excellent activates the piston to
 

559
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,900
over excellent activates the piston to
let the water out but it also branches

560
00:16:59,900 --> 00:16:59,910
let the water out but it also branches
 

561
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:06,579
let the water out but it also branches
off here goes down there's one torch

562
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,589

 

563
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,290

okay

564
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,300
okay
 

565
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,329
okay
okay it comes down there's that torch

566
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
okay it comes down there's that torch
 

567
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,370
okay it comes down there's that torch
there's another torch here that's two

568
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,380
there's another torch here that's two
 

569
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:22,370
there's another torch here that's two
torches over to here and towards my

570
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:22,380
torches over to here and towards my
 

571
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,649
torches over to here and towards my
third torch oh yeah

572
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:28,659

 

573
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:31,680

this is my third torch plus three

574
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:31,690
this is my third torch plus three
 

575
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,460
this is my third torch plus three
torches and there's three repeaters set

576
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:35,470
torches and there's three repeaters set
 

577
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,909
torches and there's three repeaters set
to four for a total of fifteen torches

578
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:38,919
to four for a total of fifteen torches
 

579
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,089
to four for a total of fifteen torches
and one torch has a delay of two ticks

580
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:45,099
and one torch has a delay of two ticks
 

581
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,279
and one torch has a delay of two ticks
so in total that comes to 30 ticks which

582
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,289
so in total that comes to 30 ticks which
 

583
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,789
so in total that comes to 30 ticks which
is the same as the water remember I said

584
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:53,799
is the same as the water remember I said
 

585
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,049
is the same as the water remember I said
water moving six blocks is 30 ticks the

586
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:58,059
water moving six blocks is 30 ticks the
 

587
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,060
water moving six blocks is 30 ticks the
redstone current passing through fifteen

588
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,070
redstone current passing through fifteen
 

589
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,279
redstone current passing through fifteen
torches is also 30 ticks so it's the

590
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,289
torches is also 30 ticks so it's the
 

591
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:10,859
torches is also 30 ticks so it's the
same amount of time let's go back up so

592
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:10,869
same amount of time let's go back up so
 

593
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,629
same amount of time let's go back up so
when the water gets to this glass block

594
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:12,639
when the water gets to this glass block
 

595
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,570
when the water gets to this glass block
here that's when this block moves down

596
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:15,580
here that's when this block moves down
 

597
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,960
here that's when this block moves down
so that it finds the opening here and it

598
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:18,970
so that it finds the opening here and it
 

599
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,229
so that it finds the opening here and it
goes straight to the hole instead of

600
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:22,239
goes straight to the hole instead of
 

601
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:26,159
goes straight to the hole instead of
spreading everywhere now when its watch

602
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:26,169
spreading everywhere now when its watch
 

603
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,169
spreading everywhere now when its watch
right when it gets here so when that

604
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:28,179
right when it gets here so when that
 

605
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:33,269
right when it gets here so when that
goes down the reason it does that is

606
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:33,279
goes down the reason it does that is
 

607
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,719
goes down the reason it does that is
because I believe the piston cuts the

608
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:36,729
because I believe the piston cuts the
 

609
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:40,649
because I believe the piston cuts the
water so it only retracts one two three

610
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:40,659
water so it only retracts one two three
 

611
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,769
water so it only retracts one two three
four five blocks instead of six or

612
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:43,779
four five blocks instead of six or
 

613
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,269
four five blocks instead of six or
twenty five ticks so there's a

614
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:45,279
twenty five ticks so there's a
 

615
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,989
twenty five ticks so there's a
difference it doesn't take as long for

616
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:48,999
difference it doesn't take as long for
 

617
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,509
difference it doesn't take as long for
the water to disappear as it takes for

618
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:51,519
the water to disappear as it takes for
 

619
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,180
the water to disappear as it takes for
it to appear which is why we don't need

620
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,190
it to appear which is why we don't need
 

621
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,029
it to appear which is why we don't need
any fancy wiring to achieve this effect

622
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039

 

623
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,769

it's very simple I just made it very

624
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:01,779
it's very simple I just made it very
 

625
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:07,769
it's very simple I just made it very
complicated for no good reason and as

626
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:07,779
complicated for no good reason and as
 

627
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,749
complicated for no good reason and as
you can see moves the items

628
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:12,759
you can see moves the items
 

629
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:19,889
you can see moves the items
all is good assuming of course my water

630
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:19,899
all is good assuming of course my water
 

631
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,869
all is good assuming of course my water
streams down here down here aren't

632
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:21,879
streams down here down here aren't
 

633
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,629
streams down here down here aren't
frozen this should work good they won't

634
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:24,639
frozen this should work good they won't
 

635
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:30,390
frozen this should work good they won't
freeze once the floor is on

636
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400

 

637
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,990

so it's pretty cool pretty cool and this

638
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,000
so it's pretty cool pretty cool and this
 

639
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,480
so it's pretty cool pretty cool and this
corner these corner ones have extra

640
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,490
corner these corner ones have extra
 

641
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,570
corner these corner ones have extra
logic to them there's an or gate so that

642
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:44,580

 

643
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,650

this one's on this is open these are

644
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:49,660
this one's on this is open these are
 

645
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,710
this one's on this is open these are
both on still open only this one's on

646
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
both on still open only this one's on
 

647
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,700
both on still open only this one's on
it's still open ooh oh that might be a

648
00:19:59,700 --> 00:19:59,710
it's still open ooh oh that might be a
 

649
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,940
it's still open ooh oh that might be a
problem no that's that's fine even if it

650
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:02,950
problem no that's that's fine even if it
 

651
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,260
problem no that's that's fine even if it
does that because it goes over the hole

652
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,270
does that because it goes over the hole
 

653
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:16,640
does that because it goes over the hole
I can't believe I never saw that before

654
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:16,650

 

655
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,350

it's only if they're both off that this

656
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
it's only if they're both off that this
 

657
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,380
it's only if they're both off that this
block comes back and we have our solid

658
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,390
block comes back and we have our solid
 

659
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,950
block comes back and we have our solid
floor again so if this or this then that

660
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
floor again so if this or this then that
 

661
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:37,580
floor again so if this or this then that
so I use it or gate for this and I

662
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,590
so I use it or gate for this and I
 

663
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,490
so I use it or gate for this and I
believe I showed it already

664
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,500
believe I showed it already
 

665
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,640
believe I showed it already
take another fall here ouch so this is

666
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,650
take another fall here ouch so this is
 

667
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,650
take another fall here ouch so this is
one wire goes to this torch here and

668
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:51,660
one wire goes to this torch here and
 

669
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,430
one wire goes to this torch here and
there's also the other wire oops

670
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
there's also the other wire oops
 

671
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,260
there's also the other wire oops
which goes to the same torch so this

672
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,270
which goes to the same torch so this
 

673
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,220
which goes to the same torch so this
torch here is the or gate sends power

674
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,230
torch here is the or gate sends power
 

675
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,090
torch here is the or gate sends power
above which activates this repeater

676
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,100
above which activates this repeater
 

677
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,880
above which activates this repeater
which sends power to this block and

678
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:08,890
which sends power to this block and
 

679
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,740
which sends power to this block and
activates the Pistons and all that fancy

680
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:10,750
activates the Pistons and all that fancy
 

681
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,790
activates the Pistons and all that fancy
stuff which we saw in an earlier video

682
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:13,800
stuff which we saw in an earlier video
 

683
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:21,000
stuff which we saw in an earlier video
so that's how that's working now okay so

684
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,010
so that's how that's working now okay so
 

685
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,730
so that's how that's working now okay so
I set up this diagonal string of ice

686
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:23,740
I set up this diagonal string of ice
 

687
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,350
I set up this diagonal string of ice
here just because I wanted to show you

here just because I wanted to show you
 

689
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,410
here just because I wanted to show you
something fun you can do with ice if you

690
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:28,420
something fun you can do with ice if you
 

691
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,490
something fun you can do with ice if you
got to fill in big area with water this

692
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:32,500
got to fill in big area with water this
 

693
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,210

697
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:49,120

make the ice melt for the big area

698
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,130
make the ice melt for the big area
 

699
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,230
make the ice melt for the big area
normally if you try to place water with

700
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,240
normally if you try to place water with
 

701
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,850
normally if you try to place water with
buckets to fill us in you'll have to

702
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:52,860
buckets to fill us in you'll have to
 

703
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,330
buckets to fill us in you'll have to
deal with the water freezing and messing

704
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,340
deal with the water freezing and messing
 

705
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,350
deal with the water freezing and messing
up your fill pattern and it takes a long

706
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,360
up your fill pattern and it takes a long
 

707
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,669
up your fill pattern and it takes a long
time to do even with buckets so else is

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
time to do even with buckets so else is
 

709
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,360
time to do even with buckets so else is
kind of weird

710
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,370
kind of weird
 

711
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:18,139
kind of weird

I'm gonna place a torch and see what

722
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:39,419
I'm gonna place a torch and see what
 

723
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm gonna place a torch and see what
happens next to it

724
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,530

 

725
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,120

no keys they're all water now wasn't

726
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,130
no keys they're all water now wasn't
 

727
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,590
no keys they're all water now wasn't
expecting this but if we place a block

728
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:52,600
expecting this but if we place a block
 

729
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,300
expecting this but if we place a block
next to the water it should force them

730
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,310
next to the water it should force them
 

731
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,570
next to the water it should force them
to update so this should still work I

732
00:22:59,570 --> 00:22:59,580
to update so this should still work I
 

733
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,240
to update so this should still work I
think actually that won't work okay

734
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,250
think actually that won't work okay
 

735
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:13,230
think actually that won't work okay
let's try this out yeah that's pretty

736
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,240
let's try this out yeah that's pretty
 

737
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720

little bit long now I would like to wrap
it up pretty quick here the last thing I

754
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
it up pretty quick here the last thing I
 

755
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,240
it up pretty quick here the last thing I
wanted to talk about is the aesthetics

756
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,250
wanted to talk about is the aesthetics
 

757
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,550
wanted to talk about is the aesthetics
of this building here I think I might

758
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:02,560
of this building here I think I might
 

759
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,860
of this building here I think I might
refer to it as a lab from now on I'm not

760
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:04,870
refer to it as a lab from now on I'm not
 

761
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,430
refer to it as a lab from now on I'm not
sure originally what I was planning on

762
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:08,440
sure originally what I was planning on
 

763
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,610
sure originally what I was planning on
doing was having like a black was it

764
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:11,620
doing was having like a black was it
 

765
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,240
doing was having like a black was it
black no I think a green blue I think um

766
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,250
black no I think a green blue I think um
 

767
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:25,470
black no I think a green blue I think um
having a blue outline something like

768
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,480
having a blue outline something like
 

769
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,840
having a blue outline something like
this doesn't really match with this

770
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:30,850
this doesn't really match with this
 

771
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,610
this doesn't really match with this
pattern here so I'd probably fill this

772
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:32,620
pattern here so I'd probably fill this
 

773
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,820
pattern here so I'd probably fill this
make it straight and make that five wide

774
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:37,830
make it straight and make that five wide
 

775
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:45,859
make it straight and make that five wide
walkway type thing

776
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:45,869

 

777
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:50,430

something like this and then fill center

778
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:50,440
something like this and then fill center
 

779
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:58,529
something like this and then fill center
with black wool this is the color scheme

780
00:24:58,529 --> 00:24:58,539
with black wool this is the color scheme
 

781
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:06,509
with black wool this is the color scheme
wise thinking of originally something

782
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:06,519
wise thinking of originally something
 

783
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,450
wise thinking of originally something
like that so there'd be a walkway on

784
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:08,460
like that so there'd be a walkway on
 

785
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,460
like that so there'd be a walkway on
this right side it'll go around and then

786
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,470
this right side it'll go around and then
 

787
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,580
this right side it'll go around and then
come back on that side there and then

788
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,590
come back on that side there and then
 

789
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,279
come back on that side there and then
they'll be stairs coming up to this

790
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,289
they'll be stairs coming up to this
 

791
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,659
they'll be stairs coming up to this
section here or going down to this

792
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:18,669
section here or going down to this
 

793
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:21,330
section here or going down to this
section here I'm not sure yet and this

794
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,340
section here I'm not sure yet and this
 

795
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,609
section here I'm not sure yet and this
will be the walkway another thing I was

796
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:23,619
will be the walkway another thing I was
 

797
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:26,279
will be the walkway another thing I was
thinking of is using green or purple

798
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:26,289
thinking of is using green or purple
 

799
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:31,619
thinking of is using green or purple
instead of the blue but you know I've

800
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:31,629
instead of the blue but you know I've
 

801
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,869
instead of the blue but you know I've
never really used color wool for

802
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:33,879
