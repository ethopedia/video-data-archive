they actually look very different from
 

65
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,789
they actually look very different from
zombies though just because of the

66
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
zombies though just because of the
 

67
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,630
zombies though just because of the
the the coloring on them but it's a

68
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
the the coloring on them but it's a
 

69
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,469
the the coloring on them but it's a
similar skin for sure

70
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
similar skin for sure
 

71
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,510
similar skin for sure
uh or similar texture they only spawn

72
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
uh or similar texture they only spawn
 

73
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,149
uh or similar texture they only spawn
in hot climates so i have confirmed they

74
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
in hot climates so i have confirmed they
 

75
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,910
in hot climates so i have confirmed they
do spawn in deserts

76
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
do spawn in deserts
 

77
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,590
do spawn in deserts
in sandy city here this is where they

78
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
in sandy city here this is where they
 

79
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,950
in sandy city here this is where they
all came from

80
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
all came from
 

81
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,990
all came from
um pretty much exactly like

82
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
um pretty much exactly like
 

83
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,310
um pretty much exactly like
zombies they don't burn in the day

84
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
zombies they don't burn in the day
 

85
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,590
zombies they don't burn in the day
though

86
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
though
 

87
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,190
though
so that's why they're kind of sticking

88
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
so that's why they're kind of sticking
 

89
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,950
so that's why they're kind of sticking
around here even even though it was

90
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
around here even even though it was
 

91
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,990
around here even even though it was
sunny

92
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
sunny
 

93
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,270
sunny

97
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,749
going to get a bunch more of them
spawning

98
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759

villagers and
it's it's like a zombie pretty much

108
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
it's it's like a zombie pretty much
 

109
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,469

exactly like them

110
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
exactly like them
 

111
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,630
exactly like them
when they uh when you hit them and they

112
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
when they uh when you hit them and they
 

113
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,230
when they uh when you hit them and they
spawn new

114
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
spawn new
 

115
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,630
spawn new
zombies like the the reinforcements it

116
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
zombies like the the reinforcements it
 

117
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,749
zombies like the the reinforcements it
actually spawns these

118
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
actually spawns these
 

119
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,990
actually spawns these
types not just random green zombies

120
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
types not just random green zombies
 

121
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,750
types not just random green zombies
and when they hit you they cause a

122
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
and when they hit you they cause a
 

123
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,869
and when they hit you they cause a
hunger status effect so

124
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
hunger status effect so
 

125
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,030
hunger status effect so
i think they have to have an empty hand

126
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
i think they have to have an empty hand
 

127
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,070
i think they have to have an empty hand
though

128
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
though
 

129
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,229
though
yeah so he gave it to me it lasts for 20

130
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
yeah so he gave it to me it lasts for 20
 

131
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,110
yeah so he gave it to me it lasts for 20
seconds

132
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120

 

133
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710

let's get hit by one of the guys with

134
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
let's get hit by one of the guys with
 

135
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,229
let's get hit by one of the guys with
the items like a boner

136
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239

 

137
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,990

yeah so it doesn't actually cause the

138
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
yeah so it doesn't actually cause the
 

139
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,710
yeah so it doesn't actually cause the
status effect because it's their hand

140
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
status effect because it's their hand
 

141
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,949
status effect because it's their hand
that causes it and if they have any item

142
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
that causes it and if they have any item
 

143
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,070
that causes it and if they have any item
it counts as a weapon i think

144
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
it counts as a weapon i think
 

145
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,710

of the guys like up on the pyramid here
so they're definitely spawning

172
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
so they're definitely spawning
 

173
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,550
so they're definitely spawning
in uh in the desert here i'm trying to

174
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
in uh in the desert here i'm trying to
 

175
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,229
in uh in the desert here i'm trying to
see if i can show you them spawning

176
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
see if i can show you them spawning
 

177
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,990
see if i can show you them spawning
reinforcements

178
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
reinforcements
 

179
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,990
reinforcements
but we gotta find one that actually does

180
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
but we gotta find one that actually does
 

181
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,190
but we gotta find one that actually does
that

182
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
that
 

183
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,550
that
doesn't look like this guy's doing it

184
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560

 

185
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,630

oh right there you see that from a

186
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
oh right there you see that from a
 

187
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,350
oh right there you see that from a
normal zombie we got a husk

188
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
normal zombie we got a husk
 

189
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,630
normal zombie we got a husk
so i think it's actually biome dependent

190
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
so i think it's actually biome dependent
 

191
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,750
so i think it's actually biome dependent
so wherever the reinforcement spawns

192
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
so wherever the reinforcement spawns
 

193
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,670
so wherever the reinforcement spawns
that is what determines what type of

194
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
that is what determines what type of
 

195
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,990
that is what determines what type of
zombie it is so a regular zombie

196
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
zombie it is so a regular zombie
 

197
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,949
zombie it is so a regular zombie
in a desert can make husks and i think a

198
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
in a desert can make husks and i think a
 

199
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,470
in a desert can make husks and i think a
husk in like a forest

200
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
husk in like a forest
 

201
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,750
husk in like a forest
can probably make regular zombies is my

202
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
can probably make regular zombies is my
 

203
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,390
can probably make regular zombies is my
theory

204
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
theory
 

205
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,830
theory
anyway oh look at this a little baby one

206
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
anyway oh look at this a little baby one
 

207
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,589
anyway oh look at this a little baby one
so it is possible you can get the baby

208
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
so it is possible you can get the baby
 

209
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,149
so it is possible you can get the baby
ones now i'm wondering if you can get a

210
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
ones now i'm wondering if you can get a
 

211
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,110
ones now i'm wondering if you can get a
chicken jackie

212
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
chicken jackie
 

213
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,589
chicken jackie
like this as well i probably can just

214
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
like this as well i probably can just
 

215
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,750
like this as well i probably can just
extremely rare

216
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
extremely rare
 

217
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,830
extremely rare
uh they don't drop anything special

218
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
uh they don't drop anything special
 

219
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,110
uh they don't drop anything special
though these guys same

220
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
though these guys same
 

221
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,830
though these guys same
drops as normal zombies as of right now

222
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
drops as normal zombies as of right now
 

223
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,910
drops as normal zombies as of right now
just zombie flesh

224
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
just zombie flesh
 

225
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,590
just zombie flesh
and i have gotten a carrot off of one of

226
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
and i have gotten a carrot off of one of
 

227
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,990
and i have gotten a carrot off of one of
them so i'm guessing you can get an iron

228
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
them so i'm guessing you can get an iron
 

229
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,509
them so i'm guessing you can get an iron
ingot as well

230
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
ingot as well
 

231
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,110
ingot as well
here's something weird though i wanted

232
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
here's something weird though i wanted
 

233
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,430
here's something weird though i wanted
to point out to you so we saw one spawn

234
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
to point out to you so we saw one spawn
 

235
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,870
to point out to you so we saw one spawn
on the pyramid right

236
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
on the pyramid right
 

237
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,990
on the pyramid right
that is actually where my uh mob system

238
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
that is actually where my uh mob system
 

239
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,350
that is actually where my uh mob system
is

240
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
is
 

241
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,430
is
underneath there that's all desert biome

242
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
underneath there that's all desert biome
 

243
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,390
underneath there that's all desert biome
we can go up there and

244
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
we can go up there and
 

245
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,550
we can go up there and
confirm that

246
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560

 

247
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,590

yeah so right underneath here is the

248
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
yeah so right underneath here is the
 

249
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,710
yeah so right underneath here is the
mob system if we look at the

250
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
mob system if we look at the
 

251
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,790
mob system if we look at the
biome there it says desert all the way

252
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
biome there it says desert all the way
 

253
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,030
biome there it says desert all the way
through here

254
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
through here
 

255
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,950
through here
but yeah check this out down below where

256
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
but yeah check this out down below where
 

257
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,950
but yeah check this out down below where
we just were

258
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
we just were
 

259
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,870
we just were
underneath the pyramid underneath the

260
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
underneath the pyramid underneath the
 

261
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,990
underneath the pyramid underneath the
mob system where they fall

262
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
mob system where they fall
 

263
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,670
mob system where they fall
down and die all the zombies

264
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
down and die all the zombies
 

265
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,590
down and die all the zombies
are just regular zombies they're regular

266
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
are just regular zombies they're regular
 

267
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,590
are just regular zombies they're regular
zombies there's no husks spawning so i

268
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
zombies there's no husks spawning so i
 

269
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,189
zombies there's no husks spawning so i
believe

270
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
believe
 

271
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,670
believe
uh they require sunlight or something to

272
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
uh they require sunlight or something to
 

273
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,469
uh they require sunlight or something to
spawn

274
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
spawn
 

275
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,110
spawn
they can't spawn in a covered area if i

276
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
they can't spawn in a covered area if i
 

277
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,189
they can't spawn in a covered area if i
was to guess

278
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
was to guess
 

279
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,110
was to guess
either that or they require certain

280
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
either that or they require certain
 

281
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,430
either that or they require certain
block types to spawn on like sand

282
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
block types to spawn on like sand
 

283
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,150
block types to spawn on like sand
uh the mop system is made out of clay

284
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
uh the mop system is made out of clay
 

285
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,070
uh the mop system is made out of clay
but i'm guessing it has to do with

286
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
but i'm guessing it has to do with
 

287
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,029
but i'm guessing it has to do with
direct sunlight uh-huh so that's

288
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
direct sunlight uh-huh so that's
 

289
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,310
direct sunlight uh-huh so that's
interesting

290
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
interesting
 

291
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,790
interesting
anyways let's go and check out maybe the

292
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
anyways let's go and check out maybe the
 

293
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,029
anyways let's go and check out maybe the
the new blocks in this patch

294
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
the new blocks in this patch
 

295
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,310
the new blocks in this patch
there's i believe five or six

296
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
there's i believe five or six
 

297
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,189
there's i believe five or six
six right i'm gonna say six um

298
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
six right i'm gonna say six um
 

299
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,310
six right i'm gonna say six um
yeah most of them are easy to get uh

300
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
yeah most of them are easy to get uh
 

301
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,550
yeah most of them are easy to get uh
they require nether brick

302
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
they require nether brick
 

303
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,310
they require nether brick
and we're gonna need some nether warts

304
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
and we're gonna need some nether warts
 

305
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,950
and we're gonna need some nether warts
which we just pass at our netherwort

306
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
which we just pass at our netherwort
 

307
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,510
which we just pass at our netherwort
farm

308
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
farm
 

309
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,230
farm
might have some in the chest here

310
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240

 

311
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,270

not that one thirteen

312
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
not that one thirteen
 

313
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,790
not that one thirteen
ah all right that's not very much

314
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
ah all right that's not very much
 

315
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,469
ah all right that's not very much
let's see so the recipes are for

316
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
let's see so the recipes are for
 

317
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,309
let's see so the recipes are for
the nether the red nether brick that's

318
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
the nether the red nether brick that's
 

319
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,510
the nether the red nether brick that's
what's called

320
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
what's called
 

321
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,510
what's called
is like that do netherwort two nether

322
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
is like that do netherwort two nether
 

323
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,110
is like that do netherwort two nether
bricks um

324
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
bricks um
 

325
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,790
bricks um
i believe that's not a recipe i knew

326
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
i believe that's not a recipe i knew
 

327
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,150
i believe that's not a recipe i knew
that

328
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
that
 

329
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,590
that
is it two by two three by three oh it's

330
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
is it two by two three by three oh it's
 

331
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,390
is it two by two three by three oh it's
three by three for the nether wart block

332
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
three by three for the nether wart block
 

333
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,430
three by three for the nether wart block
and then there's also

334
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
and then there's also
 

335
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,590
and then there's also
a magma block which looks kind of cool

336
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
a magma block which looks kind of cool
 

337
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,990
a magma block which looks kind of cool
that requires i believe

338
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
that requires i believe
 

339
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,309
that requires i believe
are they called magma cream yeah so

340
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
are they called magma cream yeah so
 

341
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,830
are they called magma cream yeah so
let's grab some blaze powder

342
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
let's grab some blaze powder
 

343
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,590
let's grab some blaze powder
you get magma cream from the magma

344
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
you get magma cream from the magma
 

345
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,230
you get magma cream from the magma
slimes but don't forget you can also get

346
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
slimes but don't forget you can also get
 

347
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,230
slimes but don't forget you can also get
it just from regular slimes and a blaze

348
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
it just from regular slimes and a blaze
 

349
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,270
it just from regular slimes and a blaze
farm

350
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
farm
 

351
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,510
farm
so you have to place powder slime ball

352
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
so you have to place powder slime ball
 

353
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,790
so you have to place powder slime ball
mix them together

354
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
mix them together
 

355
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,309
mix them together
so it's it's a pretty easy block to get

356
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
so it's it's a pretty easy block to get
 

357
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,510
so it's it's a pretty easy block to get
like so all right and then the other one

358
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
like so all right and then the other one
 

359
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,350
like so all right and then the other one
the one i'm most excited about

360
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
the one i'm most excited about
 

361
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,070
the one i'm most excited about
is the bone blocks oh and i got salami

362
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
is the bone blocks oh and i got salami
 

363
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,749
is the bone blocks oh and i got salami
actually

364
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759

 

365
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,870

not like that it is bone meal you

366
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
not like that it is bone meal you
 

367
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,629
not like that it is bone meal you
actually convert it into bone meal

368
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
actually convert it into bone meal
 

369
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,150
actually convert it into bone meal
so it's three bones per block

370
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
so it's three bones per block
 

371
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,749
so it's three bones per block
and then in creative mode there's a

372
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
and then in creative mode there's a
 

373
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,589
and then in creative mode there's a
structure block in the void

374
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
structure block in the void
 

375
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,710
structure block in the void
block structure void so six total right

376
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
block structure void so six total right
 

377
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,629
block structure void so six total right
okay guys so i took a moment here to

378
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
okay guys so i took a moment here to
 

379
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,230
okay guys so i took a moment here to
make a bunch of them up and to

380
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
make a bunch of them up and to
 

381
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,230
make a bunch of them up and to
get a few other blocks together here so

382
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
get a few other blocks together here so
 

383
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,469
get a few other blocks together here so
we can try find some color combinations

384
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
we can try find some color combinations
 

385
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,350
we can try find some color combinations
and that kind of thing

386
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
and that kind of thing
 

387
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,029
and that kind of thing
we're going to indulge for a little bit

388
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
we're going to indulge for a little bit
 

389
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,029
we're going to indulge for a little bit
here we're going to bring out our

390
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
here we're going to bring out our
 

391
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,150
here we're going to bring out our
inner builder and see if we can find

392
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
inner builder and see if we can find
 

393
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,589
inner builder and see if we can find
some way of using these so i do

394
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
some way of using these so i do
 

395
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,189
some way of using these so i do
i let me know what you guys think of

396
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
i let me know what you guys think of
 

397
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,309
i let me know what you guys think of
these too like before i

398
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
these too like before i
 

399
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,189
these too like before i
bias your opinion here i will say i love

400
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
bias your opinion here i will say i love
 

401
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,189
bias your opinion here i will say i love
the bone block i think the bone block is

402
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
the bone block i think the bone block is
 

403
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,469
the bone block i think the bone block is
great

404
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
great
 

405
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,710
great
uh the other three not quite as excited

406
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
uh the other three not quite as excited
 

407
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,189
uh the other three not quite as excited
about

408
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
about
 

409
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,029
about
this one is probably my second favorite

410
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
this one is probably my second favorite
 

411
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,710
this one is probably my second favorite
the magma block

412
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
the magma block
 

413
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,869
the magma block
just because it's animated like look at

414
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
just because it's animated like look at
 

415
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,469
just because it's animated like look at
this

416
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
this
 

417
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,749
this
oh yeah it's animated and it has a

418
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
oh yeah it's animated and it has a
 

419
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,309
oh yeah it's animated and it has a
special function where if you

420
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
special function where if you
 

421
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,150
special function where if you
if you step on it or if a mob steps on

422
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
if you step on it or if a mob steps on
 

423
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,869
if you step on it or if a mob steps on
it they take damage and this is not

424
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
it they take damage and this is not
 

425
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,749
it they take damage and this is not
fire damage it is lowering the

426
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
fire damage it is lowering the
 

427
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,110
fire damage it is lowering the
durability on my armor here

428
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
durability on my armor here
 

429
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,350
durability on my armor here
not on the lyra wings though of course

430
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
not on the lyra wings though of course
 

431
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,150
not on the lyra wings though of course
um

432
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
um
 

433
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,309
um
it's not fire damage it's similar to the

434
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
it's not fire damage it's similar to the
 

435
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,070
it's not fire damage it's similar to the
damage you get from a cactus

436
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
damage you get from a cactus
 

437
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,070
damage you get from a cactus
but unlike a cactus i don't believe it

438
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
but unlike a cactus i don't believe it
 

439
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,350
but unlike a cactus i don't believe it
destroys items

440
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
destroys items
 

441
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,990
destroys items
let's try that out yeah so you can have

442
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
let's try that out yeah so you can have
 

443
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,430
let's try that out yeah so you can have
items on there

444
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
items on there
 

445
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,589
items on there
it's really good as like a mob grinder

446
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
it's really good as like a mob grinder
 

447
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,630
it's really good as like a mob grinder
though

448
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640

 

449
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,750

all right let's try out the

450
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
all right let's try out the
 

451
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,909
all right let's try out the
the nether brick i do really like how

452
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
the nether brick i do really like how
 

453
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,070
the nether brick i do really like how
this looks just on its own but i

454
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
this looks just on its own but i
 

455
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,389
this looks just on its own but i
worry guys i'm very concerned we're not

456
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
worry guys i'm very concerned we're not
 

457
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,949
worry guys i'm very concerned we're not
going to be able to use it in the game

458
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
going to be able to use it in the game
 

459
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,350
going to be able to use it in the game
because it doesn't go with anything else

460
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
because it doesn't go with anything else
 

461
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,230
because it doesn't go with anything else
i don't think

462
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
i don't think
 

463
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,070
i don't think
and especially this one the netherward

464
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
and especially this one the netherward
 

465
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,750
and especially this one the netherward
block

466
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
block
 

467
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,949
block
um i will say i like the textures on all

468
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
um i will say i like the textures on all
 

469
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,110
um i will say i like the textures on all
of the blocks i'm just not so sure about

470
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
of the blocks i'm just not so sure about
 

471
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,430
of the blocks i'm just not so sure about
like the saturation level and

472
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
like the saturation level and
 

473
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,910
like the saturation level and
and the coloring in that might not be

474
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
and the coloring in that might not be
 

475
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,590
and the coloring in that might not be
the best

476
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
the best
 

477
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,190
the best
but we'll see we'll try some stuff out

478
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
but we'll see we'll try some stuff out
 

479
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,070
but we'll see we'll try some stuff out
here so

480
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
here so
 

481
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,710
here so
we got our blocks um what do we try

482
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
we got our blocks um what do we try
 

483
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,630
we got our blocks um what do we try
first

484
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
first
 

485
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
first
okay nether brick netherrack let's try

486
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
okay nether brick netherrack let's try
 

487
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,710
okay nether brick netherrack let's try
the nether stuff first

488
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
the nether stuff first
 

489
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,230
the nether stuff first
and just see how it goes with it was

490
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
and just see how it goes with it was
 

491
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,230
and just see how it goes with it was
there any other nether stuff

492
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
there any other nether stuff
 

493
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,990
there any other nether stuff
uh i guess soul sand but i didn't bring

494
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
uh i guess soul sand but i didn't bring
 

495
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,430
uh i guess soul sand but i didn't bring
that

496
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
that
 

497
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,150
that
okay so nether brick next to this stuff

498
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
okay so nether brick next to this stuff
 

499
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,670
okay so nether brick next to this stuff
it's not bad it's not bad right

500
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
it's not bad it's not bad right
 

501
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,070
it's not bad it's not bad right
um it does look like the same texture

502
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
um it does look like the same texture
 

503
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,269
um it does look like the same texture
actually just a different

504
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
actually just a different
 

505
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,550
actually just a different
color and this one you can tell it has

506
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
color and this one you can tell it has
 

507
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,110
color and this one you can tell it has
like blotches that are particularly

508
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
like blotches that are particularly
 

509
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,949
like blotches that are particularly
high saturation and i like how that

510
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
high saturation and i like how that
 

511
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,310
high saturation and i like how that
looks like this brick here for example

512
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
looks like this brick here for example
 

513
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,630
looks like this brick here for example
is really stands out in this little

514
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
is really stands out in this little
 

515
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,550
is really stands out in this little
little square over here

516
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
little square over here
 

517
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,829
little square over here
i think that looks okay though i don't

518
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
i think that looks okay though i don't
 

519
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,269
i think that looks okay though i don't
know i think if i was to use it i would

520
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
know i think if i was to use it i would
 

521
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,069
know i think if i was to use it i would
use it for the

522
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
use it for the
 

523
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,670
use it for the
floor and the nether brick for the wall

524
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
floor and the nether brick for the wall
 

525
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,990
floor and the nether brick for the wall
maybe

526
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
maybe
 

527
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,870
maybe
it's not too bad okay okay

528
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
it's not too bad okay okay
 

529
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,350
it's not too bad okay okay
i could see putting those two together

530
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
i could see putting those two together
 

531
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,069
i could see putting those two together
let's try

532
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
let's try
 

533
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,870
let's try
another rack next to it netherrack is

534
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
another rack next to it netherrack is
 

535
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,630
another rack next to it netherrack is
one of my least favorite blocks in this

536
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
one of my least favorite blocks in this
 

537
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,030
one of my least favorite blocks in this
game

538
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040

 

539
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,389

but it's all over the nether so

540
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
but it's all over the nether so
 

541
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,670
but it's all over the nether so
yeah they work together too for sure

542
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
yeah they work together too for sure
 

543
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,910
yeah they work together too for sure
oh yeah check it out guys

544
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
oh yeah check it out guys
 

545
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,949
oh yeah check it out guys
you can see it i am the best builder

546
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
you can see it i am the best builder
 

547
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,389
you can see it i am the best builder
in this game now i i know this looks

548
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
in this game now i i know this looks
 

549
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,269
in this game now i i know this looks
pretty bad

550
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
pretty bad
 

551
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,190
pretty bad
uh i was just doing some experiments

552
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
uh i was just doing some experiments
 

553
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,630
uh i was just doing some experiments
here trying to learn

554
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
here trying to learn
 

555
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,870
here trying to learn
a few things about the blocks and uh

556
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
a few things about the blocks and uh
 

557
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,550
a few things about the blocks and uh
yeah i think i

558
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
yeah i think i
 

559
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,230
yeah i think i
i figured out a couple things here let's

560
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
i figured out a couple things here let's
 

561
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,389
i figured out a couple things here let's
start with the netherwort block

562
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
start with the netherwort block
 

563
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,790
start with the netherwort block
um i would say this this netherward

564
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
um i would say this this netherward
 

565
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,470
um i would say this this netherward
block is not really good for um

566
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
block is not really good for um
 

567
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,910
block is not really good for um
like the foreground it's more of a

568
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
like the foreground it's more of a
 

569
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,990
like the foreground it's more of a
background block a backdrop

570
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
background block a backdrop
 

571
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,630
background block a backdrop
because it has it doesn't have any

572
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
because it has it doesn't have any
 

573
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,870
because it has it doesn't have any
straight lines in the texture it's more

574
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
straight lines in the texture it's more
 

575
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,509
straight lines in the texture it's more
chaotic

576
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
chaotic
 

577
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,790
chaotic
kind of like netherrack um i find in

578
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
kind of like netherrack um i find in
 

579
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,990
kind of like netherrack um i find in
this game blocks that have

580
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
this game blocks that have
 

581
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,150
this game blocks that have
straight lines look like they give

582
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
straight lines look like they give
 

583
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,350
straight lines look like they give
structural supports

584
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
structural supports
 

585
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,910
structural supports
like bricks here so those those are

586
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
like bricks here so those those are
 

587
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,230
like bricks here so those those are
better suited for the foreground

588
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
better suited for the foreground
 

589
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,110
better suited for the foreground
um that being said though i usually like

590
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
um that being said though i usually like
 

591
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,829
um that being said though i usually like
my background blocks to be kind of dull

592
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
my background blocks to be kind of dull
 

593
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,269
my background blocks to be kind of dull
and i want the foreground blocks to

594
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
and i want the foreground blocks to
 

595
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,710
and i want the foreground blocks to
stand out

596
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
stand out
 

597
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,710
stand out
so it's almost a conflict of interest

598
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
so it's almost a conflict of interest
 

599
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,590
so it's almost a conflict of interest
having a bright background block

600
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
having a bright background block
 

601
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,470
having a bright background block
but hey in if you use it right it'll

602
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
but hey in if you use it right it'll
 

603
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,990
but hey in if you use it right it'll
probably look good

604
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
probably look good
 

605
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,230
probably look good
it is very similar to the red nether

606
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
it is very similar to the red nether
 

607
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,670
it is very similar to the red nether
brick

608
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
brick
 

609
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,030
brick
and i do like how it looks with the

610
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
and i do like how it looks with the
 

611
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,030
and i do like how it looks with the
regular nether brick too

612
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
regular nether brick too
 

613
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,829
regular nether brick too
in fact i would maybe even prefer to use

614
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
in fact i would maybe even prefer to use
 

615
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,670
in fact i would maybe even prefer to use
regular just so there's that that

616
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
regular just so there's that that
 

617
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,710
regular just so there's that that
more contrast between the two

618
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
more contrast between the two
 

619
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
more contrast between the two
if i was to choose between red and and

620
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
if i was to choose between red and and
 

621
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,030
if i was to choose between red and and
regular um

622
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
regular um
 

623
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,069
regular um
also goes well with netherrack i do feel

624
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
also goes well with netherrack i do feel
 

625
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,150
also goes well with netherrack i do feel
though this magma block

626
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
though this magma block
 

627
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,590
though this magma block
doesn't look the best with the red

628
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
doesn't look the best with the red
 

629
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,430
doesn't look the best with the red
nether brick or with the

630
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
nether brick or with the
 

631
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,990
nether brick or with the
the netherwort over here because this is

632
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
the netherwort over here because this is
 

633
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,590
the netherwort over here because this is
more red burgundy

634
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
more red burgundy
 

635
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,350
more red burgundy
and this is more orange with the

636
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
and this is more orange with the
 

637
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,190
and this is more orange with the
in between here being kind of a burgundy

638
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
in between here being kind of a burgundy
 

639
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,470
in between here being kind of a burgundy
brown

640
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
brown
 

641
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,069
brown
um yeah not the best together

642
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
um yeah not the best together
 

643
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,150
um yeah not the best together
i do really like regular nether brick

644
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
i do really like regular nether brick
 

645
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,750
i do really like regular nether brick
with this stuff though because this

646
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
with this stuff though because this
 

647
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,910
with this stuff though because this
color over here in the middle

648
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
color over here in the middle
 

649
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,230
color over here in the middle
very very close to this isn't it

650
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240

 

651
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,150

i think so they complement each other

652
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
i think so they complement each other
 

653
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,230
i think so they complement each other
pretty nicely

654
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
pretty nicely
 

655
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,389
pretty nicely
um this magma stuff actually spawns

656
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
um this magma stuff actually spawns
 

657
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,389
um this magma stuff actually spawns
next to netherrack i'm pretty sure and

658
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
next to netherrack i'm pretty sure and
 

659
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,870
next to netherrack i'm pretty sure and
together i don't know

660
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
together i don't know
 

661
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,030
together i don't know
i i feel like they could blend a little

662
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
i i feel like they could blend a little
 

663
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,550
i i feel like they could blend a little
bit better

664
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
bit better
 

665
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,230
bit better
but it's not it's not terrible it's not

666
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
but it's not it's not terrible it's not
 

667
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,829
but it's not it's not terrible it's not
terrible i guess

668
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
terrible i guess
 

669
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,670
terrible i guess
uh the bone block though because it's a

670
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
uh the bone block though because it's a
 

671
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,190
uh the bone block though because it's a
white block it could pretty much

672
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
white block it could pretty much
 

673
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,190
white block it could pretty much
be used with anything i feel um

674
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
be used with anything i feel um
 

675
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,710
be used with anything i feel um
kind of like nether quartz nether quartz

676
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
kind of like nether quartz nether quartz
 

677
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,829
kind of like nether quartz nether quartz
could pretty much be used with

678
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
could pretty much be used with
 

679
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,190
could pretty much be used with
everything too

680
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
everything too
 

681
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,670
everything too
uh i wanted to actually compare the two

682
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
uh i wanted to actually compare the two
 

683
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,509
uh i wanted to actually compare the two
next to each other

684
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
next to each other
 

685
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,030
next to each other
wow you know they're they're really

686
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
wow you know they're they're really
 

687
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,110
wow you know they're they're really
close together you could probably

688
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
close together you could probably
 

689
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,829
close together you could probably
replace quartz with the bone block in a

690
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
replace quartz with the bone block in a
 

691
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,949
replace quartz with the bone block in a
lot of cases

692
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
lot of cases
 

693
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,829
lot of cases
and that's uh that is wonderful if you

694
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
and that's uh that is wonderful if you
 

695
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,470
and that's uh that is wonderful if you
didn't know

696
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
didn't know
 

697
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,230
didn't know
collecting quartz is one of my least

698
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
collecting quartz is one of my least
 

699
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,990
collecting quartz is one of my least
favorite things in this game i've always

700
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
favorite things in this game i've always
 

701
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,710
favorite things in this game i've always
wished that villagers would trade it

702
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
wished that villagers would trade it
 

703
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,509
wished that villagers would trade it
i think that would be amazing and i

704
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
i think that would be amazing and i
 

705
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,110
i think that would be amazing and i
actually try to avoid using it just

706
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
actually try to avoid using it just
 

707
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,870
actually try to avoid using it just
because it's such a pain to get

708
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
because it's such a pain to get
 

709
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,110
because it's such a pain to get
some people like collecting quartz but i

710
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
some people like collecting quartz but i
 

711
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,069
some people like collecting quartz but i
don't

712
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
don't
 

713
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,949
don't
so i'm very happy it looks like i'm

714
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
so i'm very happy it looks like i'm
 

715
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,110
so i'm very happy it looks like i'm
going to be able to replace it

716
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
going to be able to replace it
 

717
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,750
going to be able to replace it
which is great and honestly this might

718
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
which is great and honestly this might
 

719
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,230
which is great and honestly this might
be better in most cases than quartz

720
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
be better in most cases than quartz
 

721
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,110
be better in most cases than quartz
because it doesn't have the lines so if

722
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
because it doesn't have the lines so if
 

723
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,470
because it doesn't have the lines so if
you have a bunch of them together it

724
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
you have a bunch of them together it
 

725
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,030
you have a bunch of them together it
looks cleaner than the quartz block

726
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
looks cleaner than the quartz block
 

727
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,910
looks cleaner than the quartz block
it looks like one big piece uh i am

728
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
it looks like one big piece uh i am
 

729
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,829
it looks like one big piece uh i am
noticing something weird going on here

730
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
noticing something weird going on here
 

731
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,910
noticing something weird going on here
though like if you look from a distance

732
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
though like if you look from a distance
 

733
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,310
though like if you look from a distance
there's definitely a horizontal line

734
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
there's definitely a horizontal line
 

735
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,990
there's definitely a horizontal line
right there

736
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
right there
 

737
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,470
right there
and when i had the nether brick over top

738
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480

 

739
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,310

wait a second yeah i'm just playing with

740
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
wait a second yeah i'm just playing with
 

741
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,150
wait a second yeah i'm just playing with
the lighting here when i had it over top

742
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
the lighting here when i had it over top
 

743
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,150
the lighting here when i had it over top
i noticed two lines

744
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
i noticed two lines
 

745
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,670
i noticed two lines
yeah there's definitely a line over

746
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
yeah there's definitely a line over
 

747
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,910
yeah there's definitely a line over
there now too

748
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
there now too
 

749
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,350
there now too
so what is causing that exactly

750
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
so what is causing that exactly
 

751
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,430
so what is causing that exactly
i'm not so sure is it the torch here

752
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
i'm not so sure is it the torch here
 

753
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,269
i'm not so sure is it the torch here
could that possibly affect it

754
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
could that possibly affect it
 

755
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,389
could that possibly affect it
i would think

756
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
i would think
 

757
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,629
i would think
it would be the same throughout because

758
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
it would be the same throughout because
 

759
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,710
it would be the same throughout because
i don't see a line right now at the top

760
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
i don't see a line right now at the top
 

761
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,030
i don't see a line right now at the top
there

762
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
there
 

763
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,030
there
just at the bottom okay i i think i know

764
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
just at the bottom okay i i think i know
 

765
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,470
just at the bottom okay i i think i know
what's happening now it's pretty clear

766
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
what's happening now it's pretty clear
 

767
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,030
what's happening now it's pretty clear
here

768
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
here
 

769
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,269
here
i put a bigger piece down and it only

770
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
i put a bigger piece down and it only
 

771
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,509
i put a bigger piece down and it only
happens at the very bottom and that is

772
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
happens at the very bottom and that is
 

773
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,350
happens at the very bottom and that is
because of the smooth lighting engine

774
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
because of the smooth lighting engine
 

775
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,470
because of the smooth lighting engine
if there's a block below then it

776
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
if there's a block below then it
 

777
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,430
if there's a block below then it
transitions to that so it darkens

778
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
transitions to that so it darkens
 

779
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,189
transitions to that so it darkens
these blocks here so if we were to

780
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
these blocks here so if we were to
 

781
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,189
these blocks here so if we were to
remove this grass

782
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
remove this grass
 

783
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,710
remove this grass
i think it disappeared well maybe not

784
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
i think it disappeared well maybe not
 

785
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,949
i think it disappeared well maybe not
wait a second

786
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
wait a second
 

787
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,870
wait a second
i'm telling you that's what it is right

788
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
i'm telling you that's what it is right
 

789
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,150
i'm telling you that's what it is right
yeah now it's gone

790
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
yeah now it's gone
 

791
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,069
yeah now it's gone
so it sort of uh darkens things oops

792
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
so it sort of uh darkens things oops
 

793
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,430
so it sort of uh darkens things oops
and we can probably see that actually if

794
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
and we can probably see that actually if
 

795
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,150
and we can probably see that actually if
we put uh quartz

796
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
we put uh quartz
 

797
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,189
we put uh quartz
right here yeah so now we have a line

798
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
right here yeah so now we have a line
 

799
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,189
right here yeah so now we have a line
there and one over there

800
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
there and one over there
 

801
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,509
there and one over there
aha so that's what's going on with that

802
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
aha so that's what's going on with that
 

803
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,790
aha so that's what's going on with that
from a distance you don't want a big

804
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
from a distance you don't want a big
 

805
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,629
from a distance you don't want a big
chunk of this bone block so i don't

806
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
chunk of this bone block so i don't
 

807
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,670
chunk of this bone block so i don't
think because then it makes these

808
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
think because then it makes these
 

809
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,430
think because then it makes these
vertical lines that are very

810
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
vertical lines that are very
 

811
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,790
vertical lines that are very
very clear and

812
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
very clear and
 

813
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,230
very clear and
yeah not the best um i tried prismarine

814
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
yeah not the best um i tried prismarine
 

815
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,230
yeah not the best um i tried prismarine
stuff here by the way

816
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
stuff here by the way
 

817
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,790
stuff here by the way
um i don't feel this or this works with

818
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
um i don't feel this or this works with
 

819
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,430
um i don't feel this or this works with
any of them

820
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
any of them
 

821
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,629
any of them
maybe the dark prismarine kind of works

822
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
maybe the dark prismarine kind of works
 

823
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,670
maybe the dark prismarine kind of works
with this

824
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
with this
 

825
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,550
with this
maybe you could combine it with this and

826
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
maybe you could combine it with this and
 

827
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,749
maybe you could combine it with this and
this

828
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
this
 

829
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,350
this
if you want like a really strong

830
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
if you want like a really strong
 

831
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,110
if you want like a really strong
contrast

832
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
contrast
 

833
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,749
contrast
um let's do some some testing here

834
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
um let's do some some testing here
 

835
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,550
um let's do some some testing here
though with the

836
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
though with the
 

837
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,430
though with the
quartz and the bone block i'll tell you

838
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
quartz and the bone block i'll tell you
 

839
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,110
quartz and the bone block i'll tell you
why i think the bone block is going to

840
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
why i think the bone block is going to
 

841
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,030
why i think the bone block is going to
be better in just about every case

842
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
be better in just about every case
 

843
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,069
be better in just about every case
besides the whole line issue

844
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
besides the whole line issue
 

845
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,990
besides the whole line issue
um i shouldn't have put the chest back

846
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
um i shouldn't have put the chest back
 

847
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,189
um i shouldn't have put the chest back
here because now i never

848
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
here because now i never
 

849
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,310
here because now i never
check back here i always go to the first

850
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
check back here i always go to the first
 

851
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,990
check back here i always go to the first
chest i see i don't think of what i'm

852
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
chest i see i don't think of what i'm
 

853
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,670
chest i see i don't think of what i'm
actually looking for

854
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
actually looking for
 

855
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,230
actually looking for
um yeah so if we put like dark oak next

856
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
um yeah so if we put like dark oak next
 

857
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,069
um yeah so if we put like dark oak next
to both of these i bet you the bone is

858
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
to both of these i bet you the bone is
 

859
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,470
to both of these i bet you the bone is
going to be better

860
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
going to be better
 

861
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,790
going to be better
yeah most definitely definitely like the

862
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
yeah most definitely definitely like the
 

863
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,710
yeah most definitely definitely like the
bone block better there

864
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
bone block better there
 

865
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,269
bone block better there
um it's going to be like that for pretty

866
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
um it's going to be like that for pretty
 

867
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,189
um it's going to be like that for pretty
much all the blocks in the game because

868
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
much all the blocks in the game because
 

869
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,030
much all the blocks in the game because
this is darker

870
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
this is darker
 

871
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,629
this is darker
a little bit darker and since this hat

872
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
a little bit darker and since this hat
 

873
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,509
a little bit darker and since this hat
this game generally has like doll dollar

874
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
this game generally has like doll dollar
 

875
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,870
this game generally has like doll dollar
blocks

876
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
blocks
 

877
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,590
blocks
um dollar d-u-l-l

878
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
um dollar d-u-l-l
 

879
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,590
um dollar d-u-l-l
er yeah again i would say

880
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
er yeah again i would say
 

881
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,470
er yeah again i would say
bone winds uh it's gonna blend better

882
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
bone winds uh it's gonna blend better
 

883
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,189
bone winds uh it's gonna blend better
with them

884
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
with them
 

885
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,110
with them
that's gonna complement them better than

886
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
that's gonna complement them better than
 

887
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,949
that's gonna complement them better than
the quartz the quartz might look better

888
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
the quartz the quartz might look better
 

889
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,550
the quartz the quartz might look better
with clay though

890
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
with clay though
 

891
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,990
with clay though
because clay is a very smooth

892
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
because clay is a very smooth
 

893
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,949
because clay is a very smooth
block again i did it here let's just try

894
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
block again i did it here let's just try
 

895
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,230
block again i did it here let's just try
let's try maybe blue i usually really

896
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
let's try maybe blue i usually really
 

897
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,789
let's try maybe blue i usually really
like

898
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
like
 

899
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,949
like
this blue clay with quartz

900
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
this blue clay with quartz
 

901
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,110
this blue clay with quartz
and now which would i prefer

902
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
and now which would i prefer
 

903
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,309
and now which would i prefer
yeah again i think the bone block wins

904
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
yeah again i think the bone block wins
 

905
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,669
yeah again i think the bone block wins
so let's talk about some block

906
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
so let's talk about some block
 

907
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,830
so let's talk about some block
combinations now guys uh we're gonna

908
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
combinations now guys uh we're gonna
 

909
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,669
combinations now guys uh we're gonna
assume just about everything works with

910
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
assume just about everything works with
 

911
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,390
assume just about everything works with
the bone

912
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
the bone
 

913
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,350
the bone
the bone block because it's white white

914
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
the bone block because it's white white
 

915
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,990
the bone block because it's white white
and black

916
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
and black
 

917
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,669
and black
kind of work with everything but when

918
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
kind of work with everything but when
 

919
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,830
kind of work with everything but when
you mix colors together then things get

920
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
you mix colors together then things get
 

921
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,110
you mix colors together then things get
crazy

922
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
crazy
 

923
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,070
crazy
especially very bright red and orange

924
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
especially very bright red and orange
 

925
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,789
especially very bright red and orange
colors things might not work the best

926
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
colors things might not work the best
 

927
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,669
colors things might not work the best
but uh yeah doing logs here i was

928
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
but uh yeah doing logs here i was
 

929
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,830
but uh yeah doing logs here i was

surprised the oak wood looks very good
with this

932
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120

here but the dark oak could work
 

945
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,310

hmm i have a hard time deciding i think
 

955
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,830
hmm i have a hard time deciding i think
the dark oak is better it's closer to

956
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
the dark oak is better it's closer to
 

957
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,310

black
 

959
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,789
black
than spruce wood so i think in general

960
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
than spruce wood so i think in general
 

961
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,510
than spruce wood so i think in general
it's better

962
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
it's better
 

963
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,630
it's better
with most blocks on the other side here

964
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
with most blocks on the other side here
 

965
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,909
with most blocks on the other side here
we have the uglier

966
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
we have the uglier
 

967
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,110

and
next up guys we have the plank blocks so

986
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
next up guys we have the plank blocks so
 

987
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,590
next up guys we have the plank blocks so
what do you think about these

988
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
what do you think about these
 

989
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,070

here
either of these it's bad but everything

994
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
either of these it's bad but everything
 

995
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,029
either of these it's bad but everything
else i think is decent like

996

especially this is jungle wood
 

1013
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,830
especially this is jungle wood
it's got a little bit of red to it so

1014
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
it's got a little bit of red to it so
 

1015
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,070
it's got a little bit of red to it so
that might be a pretty good one too

1016
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
that might be a pretty good one too
 

1017
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,750
that might be a pretty good one too
usually i really don't like jungle wood

1018
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
usually i really don't like jungle wood
 

1019
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,029
usually i really don't like jungle wood
but with this

1020
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
but with this
 

1021
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,029
but with this
might be not too bad oh hello

1022
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
might be not too bad oh hello
 

1023
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,789
might be not too bad oh hello
oh no it's three hits i forgot it's

1024
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
oh no it's three hits i forgot it's

oh no it's three hits i forgot it's
three hits

1026
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919

 

1027
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,789

um birchwood is bad with all three of

1028
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
um birchwood is bad with all three of
 

1029
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,590
um birchwood is bad with all three of
them

1030
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
them
 

1031
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,430
them
i would say um and then between dark oak

1032
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
i would say um and then between dark oak
 

1033
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,230
i would say um and then between dark oak
and spruce

1034
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
and spruce
 

1035
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,510
and spruce
wood it's kind of hard to say i like uh

1036
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
wood it's kind of hard to say i like uh
 

1037
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,470
wood it's kind of hard to say i like uh
i like the dark oak more with this one

1038
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
i like the dark oak more with this one
 

1039
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,149
i like the dark oak more with this one
but i think i like the spruce wood more

1040
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
but i think i like the spruce wood more
 

1041
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,470
but i think i like the spruce wood more
with

1042
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
with
 

1043
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,990
with
this one

1044
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
this one
 

1045
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,029
this one
and don't really like the jungle wood

1046
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
and don't really like the jungle wood
 

1047
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,590
and don't really like the jungle wood
with the the magma here

1048
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
with the the magma here
 

1049
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,590
with the the magma here
all right guys here we have the stone

1050
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
all right guys here we have the stone
 

1051
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,990
all right guys here we have the stone
blocks and i find they stand out quite a

1052
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
blocks and i find they stand out quite a
 

1053
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,149
blocks and i find they stand out quite a
bit don't they

1054
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
bit don't they
 

1055
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,710
bit don't they
yeah uh they're a bit on the light side

1056
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
yeah uh they're a bit on the light side
 

1057
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,230
yeah uh they're a bit on the light side
if they were a darker gray i think they

1058
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
if they were a darker gray i think they
 

1059
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,710
if they were a darker gray i think they
would work

1060
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720

 

1061
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,510

clay blocks okay so i don't really like

1062
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
clay blocks okay so i don't really like
 

1063
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,070
clay blocks okay so i don't really like
the white clay blocks with any of these

1064
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
the white clay blocks with any of these
 

1065
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,669
the white clay blocks with any of these
but everything else here is pretty good

1066
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
but everything else here is pretty good
 

1067
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,470
but everything else here is pretty good
this is the light gray this is a gray

1068
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
this is the light gray this is a gray
 

1069
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,549
this is the light gray this is a gray
i think that works good with all three

1070
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
i think that works good with all three
 

1071
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,510
i think that works good with all three
on the other side here we have black

1072
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
on the other side here we have black
 

1073
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,110
on the other side here we have black
pretty good as well brown it's not bad

1074
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
pretty good as well brown it's not bad
 

1075
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,270
pretty good as well brown it's not bad
and then the hardened clay just the

1076
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
and then the hardened clay just the
 

1077
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,950
and then the hardened clay just the
regular stuff

1078
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
regular stuff
 

1079
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,830
regular stuff
i find it works the best with this one

1080
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
i find it works the best with this one
 

1081
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,710
i find it works the best with this one
then maybe this one then this one

1082
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
then maybe this one then this one
 

1083
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,870
then maybe this one then this one
now we get into the colors here so

1084
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
now we get into the colors here so
 

1085
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,070
now we get into the colors here so
yellow and orange

1086
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
yellow and orange
 

1087
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,110
yellow and orange
good with this not the red uh

1088
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
good with this not the red uh
 

1089
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,870
good with this not the red uh
not the yellow with this but maybe the

1090
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
not the yellow with this but maybe the
 

1091
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,390
not the yellow with this but maybe the
orange and red

1092
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
orange and red
 

1093
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,190
orange and red
and same with this one um on the back

1094
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
and same with this one um on the back
 

1095
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,830
and same with this one um on the back
side here i am not sure

1096
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
side here i am not sure
 

1097
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,710
side here i am not sure
uh none of these with this one i know

1098
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
uh none of these with this one i know
 

1099
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,149
uh none of these with this one i know
that

1100
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
that
 

1101
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,310
that
but if you want something crazy looking

1102
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
but if you want something crazy looking
 

1103
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,070
but if you want something crazy looking
you might be able to pull this off

1104
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080

 

1105
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,149

this one is a little bit more tricky for

1106
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
this one is a little bit more tricky for
 

1107
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,390
this one is a little bit more tricky for
me to decide i don't mind the green

1108
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
me to decide i don't mind the green
 

1109
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,029
me to decide i don't mind the green
actually

1110
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
actually
 

1111
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,590
actually
i thought i i thought they would be bad

1112
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
i thought i i thought they would be bad
 

1113
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,390
i thought i i thought they would be bad
but i don't mind it especially with the

1114
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
but i don't mind it especially with the
 

1115
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,510
but i don't mind it especially with the
orange here uh the cyan is bad

1116
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
orange here uh the cyan is bad
 

1117
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,590
orange here uh the cyan is bad
it doesn't really go on the other side

1118
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
it doesn't really go on the other side
 

1119
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,350
it doesn't really go on the other side
here we have the blues

1120
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
here we have the blues
 

1121
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,270
here we have the blues
and the lighter blues definitely no

1122
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
and the lighter blues definitely no
 

1123
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,310
and the lighter blues definitely no
but maybe the the dark blue here could

1124
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
but maybe the the dark blue here could
 

1125
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,029
but maybe the the dark blue here could
be pretty good um

1126
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
be pretty good um
 

1127
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,549
be pretty good um
and yeah that's that's probably enough

1128
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
and yeah that's that's probably enough
 

1129
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,710
and yeah that's that's probably enough
uh checking there's more blocks in the

1130
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
uh checking there's more blocks in the
 

1131
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,310
uh checking there's more blocks in the
game but we could be here forever

1132
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
game but we could be here forever
 

1133
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,990
game but we could be here forever
i will say one thing though you might be

1134
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
i will say one thing though you might be
 

1135
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,830
i will say one thing though you might be
like wow there's so many blocks that

1136
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
like wow there's so many blocks that
 

1137
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,669
like wow there's so many blocks that
work with this

1138
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
work with this
 

1139
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,750
work with this
uh you might notice every time i've been

1140
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
uh you might notice every time i've been
 

1141
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,669
uh you might notice every time i've been
testing these i've had them either on

1142
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
testing these i've had them either on
 

1143
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,630
testing these i've had them either on
the ground or

1144
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
the ground or
 

1145
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,470
the ground or
one block in front like that

1146
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
one block in front like that
 

1147
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,470
one block in front like that
the main problem with these new blocks

1148
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
the main problem with these new blocks
 

1149
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,750
the main problem with these new blocks
is nothing really

1150
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
is nothing really
 

1151
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,270
is nothing really
works flush with them okay

1152
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
works flush with them okay
 

1153
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,390
works flush with them okay
let me explain so let's take prismarine

1154
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
let me explain so let's take prismarine
 

1155
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,590
let me explain so let's take prismarine
for example

1156
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
for example
 

1157
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,070
for example
we have the bricks yeah here's the

1158
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
we have the bricks yeah here's the
 

1159
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,029
we have the bricks yeah here's the
bricks

1160
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
bricks
 

1161
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,590
bricks
so these two blocks they're very similar

1162
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
so these two blocks they're very similar
 

1163
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,350
so these two blocks they're very similar
in color and they're also very similar

1164
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
in color and they're also very similar
 

1165
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,510
in color and they're also very similar
in texture like the

1166
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
in texture like the
 

1167
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,310
in texture like the
they're both kind of broken looking um

1168
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
they're both kind of broken looking um
 

1169
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,070
they're both kind of broken looking um
because of that you can put them side by

1170
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
because of that you can put them side by
 

1171
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,430
because of that you can put them side by
side and they look pretty good

1172
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
side and they look pretty good
 

1173
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,870
side and they look pretty good
but these nothing is very

1174
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
but these nothing is very
 

1175
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,789
but these nothing is very
nothing really matches the color and

1176
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
nothing really matches the color and
 

1177
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,029
nothing really matches the color and
there's very few that match the texture

1178
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
there's very few that match the texture
 

1179
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,909
there's very few that match the texture
there are bricks in the game but like

1180
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
there are bricks in the game but like
 

1181
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,350
there are bricks in the game but like
even if we put nether brick

1182
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
even if we put nether brick
 

1183
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,230
even if we put nether brick
next to this like flush with it and we

1184
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
next to this like flush with it and we
 

1185
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,830
next to this like flush with it and we
tried to mix them in here i don't know

1186
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
tried to mix them in here i don't know
 

1187
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,909
tried to mix them in here i don't know
if it would look good

1188
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
if it would look good
 

1189
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,510
if it would look good
this is like as close as you're gonna

1190
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
this is like as close as you're gonna
 

1191
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,430
this is like as close as you're gonna
get to this

1192
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
get to this
 

1193
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,669
get to this
now it just stands out way too much the

1194
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
now it just stands out way too much the
 

1195
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,710
now it just stands out way too much the
color is so different

1196
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
color is so different
 

1197
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,750
color is so different
i don't know uh what other bricks are

1198
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
i don't know uh what other bricks are
 

1199
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,390
i don't know uh what other bricks are
there

1200
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400

 

1201
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,630

yeah there's a

1202
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
yeah there's a
 

1203
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,029
yeah there's a
oh i guess there's regular bricks but

1204
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
oh i guess there's regular bricks but
 

1205
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,029
oh i guess there's regular bricks but
those probably wouldn't be good

1206
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
those probably wouldn't be good
 

1207
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,950
those probably wouldn't be good
um oh red sandstone kind of a brick look

1208
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960

 

1209
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,430

like nope that's not gonna work this

1210
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
like nope that's not gonna work this
 

1211
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,789
like nope that's not gonna work this
again that's probably gonna be one of

1212
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
again that's probably gonna be one of
 

1213
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,029
again that's probably gonna be one of
the closest you can get to it and it

1214
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
the closest you can get to it and it
 

1215
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,549
the closest you can get to it and it
stands out so much so anything flush

1216
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
stands out so much so anything flush
 

1217
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,230
stands out so much so anything flush
with it is gonna be tough to do but if

1218
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
with it is gonna be tough to do but if
 

1219
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,070
with it is gonna be tough to do but if
you go one block forward a lot of stuff

1220
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
you go one block forward a lot of stuff
 

1221
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,830
you go one block forward a lot of stuff
will work

1222
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
will work
 

1223
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,430
will work
and there's one more trick i want to

1224
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
and there's one more trick i want to
 

1225
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,350
and there's one more trick i want to
remind you guys about in this game

1226
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
remind you guys about in this game
 

1227
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,950
remind you guys about in this game
not just with these blocks but all the

1228
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
not just with these blocks but all the
 

1229
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,390
not just with these blocks but all the
blocks in the game

1230
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
blocks in the game
 

1231
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,630
blocks in the game
if you find you can't quite make

1232
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
if you find you can't quite make
 

1233
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,390
if you find you can't quite make
something blend well

1234
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
something blend well
 

1235
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,750
something blend well
you can always try stained glass so

1236
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
you can always try stained glass so
 

1237
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,350
you can always try stained glass so
it gives it a slightly different hue

1238
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,360
it gives it a slightly different hue
 

1239
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,269
it gives it a slightly different hue
so you can make something look maybe a

1240
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:57,279
so you can make something look maybe a
 

1241
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,190
so you can make something look maybe a
bit more green or a bit more whatever

1242
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
bit more green or a bit more whatever
 

1243
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,630
bit more green or a bit more whatever
color you want

1244
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
color you want
 

1245
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,590
color you want
you still got the cool animated texture

1246
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
you still got the cool animated texture
 

1247
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,350
you still got the cool animated texture
in the back here

1248
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
in the back here
 

1249
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,269
in the back here
but now it kind of suits this a bit

1250
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
but now it kind of suits this a bit
 

1251
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,029
but now it kind of suits this a bit
better

1252
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
better
 

1253
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,350
better
uh so now let's look at a couple more

1254
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
uh so now let's look at a couple more
 

1255
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,190
uh so now let's look at a couple more
details with these new blocks

1256
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
details with these new blocks
 

1257
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,070
details with these new blocks
the magma block for example actually

1258
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
the magma block for example actually
 

1259
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,510
the magma block for example actually
puts out light

1260
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
puts out light
 

1261
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,110
puts out light
you won't notice this in the nether

1262
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
you won't notice this in the nether
 

1263
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,029
you won't notice this in the nether
because the nether has a

1264
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
because the nether has a
 

1265
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,269
because the nether has a
permanent light of seven if i remember

1266
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
permanent light of seven if i remember
 

1267
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,470
permanent light of seven if i remember
right

1268
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
right
 

1269
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,710
right
and this only puts out a light level of

1270
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
and this only puts out a light level of
 

1271
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,830
and this only puts out a light level of
uh i think

1272
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
uh i think
 

1273
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,669
uh i think
three at our feet right now it says two

1274
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
three at our feet right now it says two
 

1275
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,190
three at our feet right now it says two
one if we're over here so yeah i think

1276
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
one if we're over here so yeah i think
 

1277
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,029
one if we're over here so yeah i think
it's three

1278
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
it's three
 

1279
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,549
it's three
something kind of weird with them which

1280
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
something kind of weird with them which
 

1281
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,789
something kind of weird with them which
might be a bug is they actually save

1282
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
might be a bug is they actually save
 

1283
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,430
might be a bug is they actually save
the the lighting so if i place a torch

1284
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
the the lighting so if i place a torch
 

1285
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,190
the the lighting so if i place a torch
and then break it

1286
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
and then break it
 

1287
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,830
and then break it
it keeps the lighting that the torch

1288
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
it keeps the lighting that the torch
 

1289
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,669
it keeps the lighting that the torch
provided it

1290
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
provided it
 

1291
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,269
provided it
crazy i know all right now if we look at

1292
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
crazy i know all right now if we look at
 

1293
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,630
crazy i know all right now if we look at
the bone blocks

1294
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
the bone blocks
 

1295
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,230
the bone blocks
this is really neat something you might

1296
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
this is really neat something you might
 

1297
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,909
this is really neat something you might
not expect

1298
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
not expect
 

1299
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,470
not expect
but they're actually transparent blocks

1300
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
but they're actually transparent blocks
 

1301
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,070
but they're actually transparent blocks
so that means if we have a torch

1302
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
so that means if we have a torch
 

1303
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,029
so that means if we have a torch
on that side and we go to this side if

1304
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
on that side and we go to this side if
 

1305
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,390
on that side and we go to this side if
we look at our lighting it says light

1306
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
we look at our lighting it says light
 

1307
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,269
we look at our lighting it says light
level 11

1308
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
level 11
 

1309
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,950
level 11
12 11. so the light passes through these

1310
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
12 11. so the light passes through these
 

1311
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,950
12 11. so the light passes through these
they're kind of like glass but you can't

1312
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
they're kind of like glass but you can't
 

1313
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,510
they're kind of like glass but you can't
see through them

1314
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
see through them
 

1315
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,669
see through them
all right another thing to look at is

1316
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
all right another thing to look at is
 

1317
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,350
all right another thing to look at is
the redstone

1318
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
the redstone
 

1319
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,669
the redstone
functionality of them nether brick is a

1320
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
functionality of them nether brick is a
 

1321
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,950
functionality of them nether brick is a
solid block

1322
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
solid block
 

1323
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,470
solid block
so the redstone passes through but

1324
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
so the redstone passes through but
 

1325
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,710
so the redstone passes through but
nether warts and the

1326
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
nether warts and the
 

1327
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,029
nether warts and the
bone block are not magma one is

1328
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
bone block are not magma one is
 

1329
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,669
bone block are not magma one is
and another cool trick you might not

1330
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
and another cool trick you might not
 

1331
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,549
and another cool trick you might not
know if you hold

1332
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
know if you hold
 

1333
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,470
know if you hold
shift and you walk on the magma block

1334
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
shift and you walk on the magma block
 

1335
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,350
shift and you walk on the magma block
you don't take damage

1336
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
you don't take damage
 

1337
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,430
you don't take damage
if you let go of shift you do

1338
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440

 

1339
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,470

and i wanted to try out the uh

1340
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
and i wanted to try out the uh
 

1341
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,110
and i wanted to try out the uh
block resistance on these so i have some

1342
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
block resistance on these so i have some
 

1343
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,750
block resistance on these so i have some
tnt set up we're gonna have some fun

1344
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
tnt set up we're gonna have some fun
 

1345
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,590
tnt set up we're gonna have some fun
first off nether brick i'm expecting to

1346
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
first off nether brick i'm expecting to
 

1347
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,990
first off nether brick i'm expecting to
be pretty tough

1348
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
be pretty tough
 

1349
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,269
be pretty tough
let's go ahead and light that see how

1350
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
let's go ahead and light that see how
 

1351
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,310
let's go ahead and light that see how
many dirt blocks get blown up

1352
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
many dirt blocks get blown up
 

1353
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,710
many dirt blocks get blown up
oh wow okay so that is actually tougher

1354
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
oh wow okay so that is actually tougher
 

1355
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,549
oh wow okay so that is actually tougher
than stone because if that was stone all

1356
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
than stone because if that was stone all
 

1357
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,029
than stone because if that was stone all
the blocks would have disappeared

1358
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
the blocks would have disappeared
 

1359
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,950
the blocks would have disappeared
interesting um bone

1360
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
interesting um bone
 

1361
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,590
interesting um bone
might be strong oh i can't place oh i

1362
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
might be strong oh i can't place oh i
 

1363
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,470
might be strong oh i can't place oh i
forgot

1364
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480

 

1365
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,990

oh this might be tough to set off

1366
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
oh this might be tough to set off
 

1367
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,190
oh this might be tough to set off
because i can't actually place any

1368
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
because i can't actually place any
 

1369
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,149
because i can't actually place any
levers or buttons on here

1370
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159

 

1371
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,990

yeah not quite as resistant for sure

1372
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
yeah not quite as resistant for sure
 

1373
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,669
yeah not quite as resistant for sure
let's do the magma

1374
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679

 

1375
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,590

uh i'm guessing this stuff's probably

1376
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
uh i'm guessing this stuff's probably
 

1377
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,430
uh i'm guessing this stuff's probably
like stone

1378
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
like stone
 

1379
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,350
like stone
oh actually very similar so two blocks

1380
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
oh actually very similar so two blocks
 

1381
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,669
oh actually very similar so two blocks
down and actually the ground

1382
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
down and actually the ground
 

1383
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,909
down and actually the ground
got damaged so it's not very resistant

1384
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
got damaged so it's not very resistant
 

1385
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,350
got damaged so it's not very resistant
at all

1386
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
at all
 

1387
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,549
at all
um now this stuff

1388
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
um now this stuff
 

1389
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,350
um now this stuff
is probably pretty weak if i was to

1390
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
is probably pretty weak if i was to
 

1391
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,669
is probably pretty weak if i was to
guess

1392
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
guess
 

1393
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,510
guess
it's kind of like mushroom blocks i

1394
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
it's kind of like mushroom blocks i
 

1395
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,350
it's kind of like mushroom blocks i
think

1396
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
think
 

1397
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,269
think
but let's just see you break it with

1398
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
but let's just see you break it with
 

1399
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,029
but let's just see you break it with
your axe all the other blocks you use

1400
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
your axe all the other blocks you use
 

1401
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,590
your axe all the other blocks you use
your pick on

1402
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
your pick on
 

1403
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,350
your pick on
oh it's not not as bad as i thought

1404
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
oh it's not not as bad as i thought
 

1405
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,950
oh it's not not as bad as i thought
actually

1406
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
actually
 

1407
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,590
actually
so the magma was the the lowest blast

1408
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
so the magma was the the lowest blast
 

1409
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,669
so the magma was the the lowest blast
resistance i believe

1410
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
resistance i believe
 

1411
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,710
resistance i believe
um yeah you mine these with your pick

1412
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:12,720
um yeah you mine these with your pick
 

1413
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,470
um yeah you mine these with your pick
even with the ace 2

1414
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
even with the ace 2
 

1415
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,710
even with the ace 2
and efficiency 5 pick here you cannot

1416
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
and efficiency 5 pick here you cannot
 

1417
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,590
and efficiency 5 pick here you cannot
instant mind the bone

1418
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
instant mind the bone
 

1419
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,149
instant mind the bone
you can however instant mind this magma

1420
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
you can however instant mind this magma
 

1421
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,710
you can however instant mind this magma
stuff even without haste 2

1422
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
stuff even without haste 2
 

1423
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,230
stuff even without haste 2
um can't insta mine this you can insta

1424
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
um can't insta mine this you can insta
 

1425
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,789
um can't insta mine this you can insta
mine

1426
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
mine
 

1427
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,269
mine
the netherwart blocks with your axe if

1428
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
the netherwart blocks with your axe if
 

1429
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,909
the netherwart blocks with your axe if
you have efficiency

1430
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
you have efficiency
 

1431
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,190
you have efficiency
oh it's only four on here i guess

1432
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
oh it's only four on here i guess
 

1433
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,029
oh it's only four on here i guess
all right i think we covered the blocks

1434
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
all right i think we covered the blocks
 

1435
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,230
all right i think we covered the blocks
finally

1436
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
finally
 

1437
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,909
finally
there's a lot to this update i might

1438
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
there's a lot to this update i might
 

1439
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,669
there's a lot to this update i might
have talked about them too long

1440
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
have talked about them too long
 

1441
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,830
have talked about them too long
but it's exciting getting new building

1442
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:47,840
but it's exciting getting new building
 

1443
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,029
but it's exciting getting new building
blocks

1444
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
blocks
 

1445
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,830
blocks
um something i wanted to try here is the

1446
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
um something i wanted to try here is the
 

1447
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,990
um something i wanted to try here is the
auto jump feature

1448
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
auto jump feature
 

1449
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,830
auto jump feature
which a lot of people were complaining

1450
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
which a lot of people were complaining
 

1451
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,789
which a lot of people were complaining
about to clarify i believe this is for

1452
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
about to clarify i believe this is for
 

1453
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,350
about to clarify i believe this is for
people with disabilities mainly

1454
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
people with disabilities mainly
 

1455
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,750
people with disabilities mainly
by default they decided to turn it on

1456
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
by default they decided to turn it on
 

1457
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,510
by default they decided to turn it on
though which i don't necessarily agree

1458
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520
though which i don't necessarily agree
 

1459
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,549
though which i don't necessarily agree
with

1460
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
with
 

1461
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,430
with
but yeah when you try out 1.10 you're

1462
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
but yeah when you try out 1.10 you're
 

1463
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,710
but yeah when you try out 1.10 you're
going to have auto jump on that's how

1464
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
going to have auto jump on that's how
 

1465
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,230
going to have auto jump on that's how
you configure it there

1466
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
you configure it there
 

1467
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,389
you configure it there
so if you walk into for example the

1468
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
so if you walk into for example the
 

1469
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,230
so if you walk into for example the
leaves here

1470
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,240
leaves here
 

1471
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,830
leaves here
i didn't press spacebar it just

1472
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
i didn't press spacebar it just
 

1473
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,789
i didn't press spacebar it just
automatically hot me over them

1474
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:20,799
automatically hot me over them
 

1475
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,630
automatically hot me over them
can probably run up a hill oh no

1476
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640

 

1477
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,630

oh that was weird okay so if you run too

1478
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
oh that was weird okay so if you run too
 

1479
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,149
oh that was weird okay so if you run too
fast you'll run into the side of the

1480
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
fast you'll run into the side of the
 

1481
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,909
fast you'll run into the side of the
block and then it doesn't try to jump

1482
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
block and then it doesn't try to jump
 

1483
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,710
block and then it doesn't try to jump
anymore it looks like

1484
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
anymore it looks like
 

1485
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,389
anymore it looks like
which makes me think this is not going

1486
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
which makes me think this is not going
 

1487
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,389
which makes me think this is not going
to work one thing i'm concerned about is

1488
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
to work one thing i'm concerned about is
 

1489
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,029
to work one thing i'm concerned about is
that people

1490
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
that people
 

1491
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,070
that people
might be able to do inhumane amazing

1492
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
might be able to do inhumane amazing
 

1493
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,549
might be able to do inhumane amazing
jumping like if you try to jump up a

1494
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
jumping like if you try to jump up a
 

1495
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,310
jumping like if you try to jump up a
side of a hill like this

1496
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
side of a hill like this
 

1497
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,470
side of a hill like this
manually it's very difficult you're

1498
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
manually it's very difficult you're
 

1499
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,669
manually it's very difficult you're
gonna get stuck a lot

1500
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
gonna get stuck a lot
 

1501
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,190
gonna get stuck a lot
so i'm wondering if you just like fly

1502
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
so i'm wondering if you just like fly
 

1503
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,350
so i'm wondering if you just like fly
over this with auto jumping

1504
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360

 

1505
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,830

no you you get stopped every every jump

1506
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
no you you get stopped every every jump
 

1507
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,389
no you you get stopped every every jump
to

1508
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
to
 

1509
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,350
to
like you would normally so i don't think

1510
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
like you would normally so i don't think
 

1511
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,430
like you would normally so i don't think
it can be abused

1512
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
it can be abused
 

1513
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,070
it can be abused

disabilities
some some have trouble pressing the

1518
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
some some have trouble pressing the
 

1519
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,389
some some have trouble pressing the
spacebar repeatedly

1520
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
spacebar repeatedly
 

1521
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,630
spacebar repeatedly
so that's what it's intended for mainly

1522
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
so that's what it's intended for mainly
 

1523
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,510
so that's what it's intended for mainly
i believe

1524
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
i believe
 

1525
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,269
i believe
and if anybody finds a convenience they

1526
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
and if anybody finds a convenience they
 

1527
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,669
and if anybody finds a convenience they
can use it too

1528
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679

 

1529
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,190

last thing we're going to do today guys

1530
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
last thing we're going to do today guys
 

1531
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,789
last thing we're going to do today guys
we're going to see if we can find a

1532
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
we're going to see if we can find a
 

1533
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,310
we're going to see if we can find a
polar bear

1534
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
polar bear
 

1535
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,190
polar bear
at our ice spike biome i suspect we need

1536
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
at our ice spike biome i suspect we need
 

1537
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,870
at our ice spike biome i suspect we need
to go to a new area though

1538
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
to go to a new area though
 

1539
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,750
to go to a new area though
but we'll just take a fly around here

1540
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
but we'll just take a fly around here
 

1541
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,190
but we'll just take a fly around here
and also we're going to look for

1542
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
and also we're going to look for
 

1543
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,070
and also we're going to look for
a stray that's the new skeleton variant

1544
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
a stray that's the new skeleton variant
 

1545
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,269
a stray that's the new skeleton variant
oh there we go there we go whoa

1546
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
oh there we go there we go whoa
 

1547
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,950
oh there we go there we go whoa
this is new terrain here and that is a

1548
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
this is new terrain here and that is a
 

1549
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,190
this is new terrain here and that is a
stray guys

1550
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
stray guys
 

1551
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,389
stray guys
oh now he's done it very very much like

1552
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
oh now he's done it very very much like

a skeleton
 

1555
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,190
a skeleton
different look though they look really

and i believe if you kill them yeah you
 

1561
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,750
and i believe if you kill them yeah you
can get a slowness arrow just one

1562
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
can get a slowness arrow just one
 

1563
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,870
can get a slowness arrow just one
and i don't know if it's every time

1564
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
and i don't know if it's every time
 

1565
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,549
and i don't know if it's every time
but that's kind of cool so that's a new

1566
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
but that's kind of cool so that's a new
 

1567
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,110
but that's kind of cool so that's a new
drop in the game

1568
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
drop in the game
 

1569
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,830
drop in the game
oh what is this oh that's one of the

1595
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,950
all right i'm gonna go back to the ice
bite biome i think

1596
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960

 

1597
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,950

pretty low here so i had to get back did
 

1621
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,350
pretty low here so i had to get back did
not find a polar bear

1622
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
not find a polar bear
 

1623
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,110
not find a polar bear
did not find a polar bear even in the

1624
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
did not find a polar bear even in the
 

1625
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,630
did not find a polar bear even in the
new terrain i was at

1626
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
new terrain i was at
 

1627
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,750
new terrain i was at
so they are not super common

1628
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
so they are not super common
 

1629
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,950
so they are not super common
i did find strays in both the ice spike

1630
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
i did find strays in both the ice spike
 

1631
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,509
i did find strays in both the ice spike
biome

1632
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
biome
 

1633
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,750
biome
and in the new planes biomes i generated

1634
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
and in the new planes biomes i generated
 

1635
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,310
and in the new planes biomes i generated
there

1636
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
there
 

1637
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,470
there
so two two confirmed biomes you can get

1638
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
so two two confirmed biomes you can get
 

1639
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,070
so two two confirmed biomes you can get
them in

1640
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
them in
 

1641
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,070
them in
and uh yeah they're they're pretty neat

1642
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080
and uh yeah they're they're pretty neat
 

1643
