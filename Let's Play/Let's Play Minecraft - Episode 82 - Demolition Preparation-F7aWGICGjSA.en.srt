Minecraft with me I've been struggling

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:17,340
Minecraft with me I've been struggling
 

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,450
Minecraft with me I've been struggling
to make videos recently guys I have

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:20,460
to make videos recently guys I have
 

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,990
to make videos recently guys I have
family visiting but every now and then I

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
family visiting but every now and then I
 

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
family visiting but every now and then I
find little moments in the day where I

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,250
find little moments in the day where I
 

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,160
find little moments in the day where I
can do some recording and this is one of

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,170
can do some recording and this is one of
 

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,280
can do some recording and this is one of
them and as you can see I finished

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,290
them and as you can see I finished
 

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,069
them and as you can see I finished
refurbishing my EMP wits at my new base

16
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:37,079
refurbishing my EMP wits at my new base
 

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,580
refurbishing my EMP wits at my new base
here I got rid of all the sandstone it's

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:40,590
here I got rid of all the sandstone it's
 

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,860
here I got rid of all the sandstone it's
snow now you guys seem to like the snow

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:42,870
snow now you guys seem to like the snow
 

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,410
snow now you guys seem to like the snow
which is good because I liked it too I

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,420
which is good because I liked it too I
 

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,209
which is good because I liked it too I
like the sandstone too but I think the

24
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:50,219
like the sandstone too but I think the
 

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,920
like the sandstone too but I think the
snow is slightly better since I'm in a

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:51,930
snow is slightly better since I'm in a
 

27
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,180
snow is slightly better since I'm in a
snowy biome and they all function like

28
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,190
snowy biome and they all function like
 

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,820
snowy biome and they all function like
the tutorial of the video down open so

30
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830
the tutorial of the video down open so
 

31
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,149
the tutorial of the video down open so
we got lava below water I probably

32
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
we got lava below water I probably
 

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,370
we got lava below water I probably
should have done that oh it's fine

34
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,380
should have done that oh it's fine
 

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,359
should have done that oh it's fine
and then we have the friar above so

36
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,369
and then we have the friar above so
 

37
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,710
and then we have the friar above so
that's good

38
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
that's good
 

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,940
that's good
these were these didn't take too long to

40
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:22,950
these were these didn't take too long to
 

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,390
these were these didn't take too long to
make the first ones took a lot longer

42
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,400
make the first ones took a lot longer
 

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,160
make the first ones took a lot longer
the wiring for the new ones though is a

44
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,170
the wiring for the new ones though is a
 

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,410
the wiring for the new ones though is a
lot easier to do it's a lot simpler

46
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:30,420
lot easier to do it's a lot simpler
 

47
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,429
lot easier to do it's a lot simpler
smaller before the wiring extended right

48
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:34,439
smaller before the wiring extended right
 

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,980
smaller before the wiring extended right
to the edge here now I have all the

50
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:36,990
to the edge here now I have all the
 

51
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,929
to the edge here now I have all the
space but I don't have my master

52
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:38,939
space but I don't have my master
 

53
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,630
space but I don't have my master
controls set up yet and I'll probably

54
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
controls set up yet and I'll probably
 

55
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,460
controls set up yet and I'll probably
wait until I actually get these working

56
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,470
wait until I actually get these working
 

57
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,580
wait until I actually get these working
like with mobs and before I set up the

58
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,590
like with mobs and before I set up the
 

59
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,010
like with mobs and before I set up the
master controls just in case I need to

60
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,020
master controls just in case I need to
 

61
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,980
master controls just in case I need to
change things again I don't want make

62
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:51,990
change things again I don't want make
 

63
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,410
change things again I don't want make
extra work for myself

64
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,420

 

65
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,929

but yeah these these are working pretty

66
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:58,939
but yeah these these are working pretty
 

67
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:04,330
but yeah these these are working pretty
good a few of my viewers have found ways

68
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,340
good a few of my viewers have found ways
 

69
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,290
good a few of my viewers have found ways
to make these EMP units smaller one

70
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:08,300
to make these EMP units smaller one
 

71
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,100
to make these EMP units smaller one
suggestion was to change the wiring like

72
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,110
suggestion was to change the wiring like
 

73
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,130
suggestion was to change the wiring like
this have a repeater below I think

74
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,140
this have a repeater below I think
 

75
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,880
this have a repeater below I think
before I had I had the wiring extend out

76
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:21,890
before I had I had the wiring extend out
 

77
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,509
before I had I had the wiring extend out
one with the repeater and then another

78
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:25,519
one with the repeater and then another
 

79
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,170
one with the repeater and then another
wire like that but you can have the same

80
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,180
wire like that but you can have the same
 

81
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,210
wire like that but you can have the same
effect by having the repeater underneath

82
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,220
effect by having the repeater underneath
 

83
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,420
effect by having the repeater underneath
the block so let's save space so thanks

84
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,430
the block so let's save space so thanks
 

85
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,009
the block so let's save space so thanks
Deborah on that point at that out and

86
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:36,019
Deborah on that point at that out and
 

87
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:37,720
Deborah on that point at that out and
there's a few other changes people have

88
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:37,730
there's a few other changes people have
 

89
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,780
there's a few other changes people have
made to make it better but I'm gonna

90
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:40,790
made to make it better but I'm gonna
 

91
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,500
made to make it better but I'm gonna
stick with my clunkier model here works

92
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,510
stick with my clunkier model here works
 

93
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,940
stick with my clunkier model here works
pretty good some people didn't like the

94
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:48,950
pretty good some people didn't like the
 

95
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,280
pretty good some people didn't like the
plus sign for the glowstone I'm gonna

96
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,290
plus sign for the glowstone I'm gonna
 

97
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,640
plus sign for the glowstone I'm gonna
keep it though because I like it a few

98
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:54,650
keep it though because I like it a few
 

99
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,729
keep it though because I like it a few
people said just to have three vertical

100
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:56,739
people said just to have three vertical
 

101
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,370
people said just to have three vertical
little stone blocks but I'm gonna keep

102
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,380
little stone blocks but I'm gonna keep
 

103
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,490
little stone blocks but I'm gonna keep
the glowstone just because it's my

104
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:03,500
the glowstone just because it's my
 

105
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,140
the glowstone just because it's my
preference and most of you said to use

106
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,150
preference and most of you said to use
 

107
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,150
preference and most of you said to use
glass instead of fences and that's the

108
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,160
glass instead of fences and that's the
 

109
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,060
glass instead of fences and that's the
definitely a good idea to in this case I

110
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,070
definitely a good idea to in this case I
 

111
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,530
definitely a good idea to in this case I
think it looks better

112
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:19,540

 

113
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,600

just because it's easier to see through

114
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:21,610
just because it's easier to see through
 

115
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:31,470
just because it's easier to see through
the glass in this case Oh Dean I'm gonna

116
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,480
the glass in this case Oh Dean I'm gonna
 

117
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,199
the glass in this case Oh Dean I'm gonna
have to redo all this floor I think

118
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,209
have to redo all this floor I think
 

119
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,349
have to redo all this floor I think
though cuz right now it's just a mess

120
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:36,359
though cuz right now it's just a mess
 

121
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,960
though cuz right now it's just a mess
since I've changed how I'm gonna do this

122
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:39,970
since I've changed how I'm gonna do this
 

123
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,729
since I've changed how I'm gonna do this
I have to change the floor

124
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:43,739

 

125
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,170

so I'm guessing I'll rip this whole

126
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,180
so I'm guessing I'll rip this whole
 

127
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,539
so I'm guessing I'll rip this whole
floor out drop it down three blocks or

128
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:48,549
floor out drop it down three blocks or
 

129
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,670
floor out drop it down three blocks or
so and then fill it with ice and then

130
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
so and then fill it with ice and then
 

131
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,140
so and then fill it with ice and then
build it up from that instead of trying

132
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,150
build it up from that instead of trying
 

133
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,009
build it up from that instead of trying
to make ice baths again and I'll have a

134
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:02,019
to make ice baths again and I'll have a
 

135
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,360
to make ice baths again and I'll have a
covering over the top of these things

136
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,370
covering over the top of these things
 

137
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,000
covering over the top of these things
somehow to make it more uniform so you

138
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,010
somehow to make it more uniform so you
 

139
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,349
somehow to make it more uniform so you
can't see this junk this piston here and

140
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:10,359
can't see this junk this piston here and
 

141
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,770
can't see this junk this piston here and
that all I want to be able to see is the

142
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:13,780
that all I want to be able to see is the
 

143
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,610
that all I want to be able to see is the
glass tubes above in the end and I

144
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:17,620
glass tubes above in the end and I
 

145
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
glass tubes above in the end and I
haven't started the spider one yet I'm

146
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,630
haven't started the spider one yet I'm
 

147
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,740
haven't started the spider one yet I'm
gonna wait on doing that as well a lot

148
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:22,750
gonna wait on doing that as well a lot
 

149
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,680
gonna wait on doing that as well a lot
of people have shown how to do it and I

150
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,690
of people have shown how to do it and I
 

151
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,790
of people have shown how to do it and I
I have a good idea how to do it too but

152
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
I have a good idea how to do it too but
 

153
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,469
I have a good idea how to do it too but
I'm gonna wait until I know everything's

154
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
I'm gonna wait until I know everything's
 

155
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,379
I'm gonna wait until I know everything's
finalized before I attempt to tackle it

156
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:37,389
finalized before I attempt to tackle it
 

157
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,909
finalized before I attempt to tackle it
just because it'll take a little bit of

158
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:38,919
just because it'll take a little bit of
 

159
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,200
just because it'll take a little bit of
time to figure it out I think uh-huh

160
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,210
time to figure it out I think uh-huh
 

161
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,040
time to figure it out I think uh-huh

167
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,110

ice melts and snow like this where it's

168
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
ice melts and snow like this where it's
 

169
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,529
ice melts and snow like this where it's
just over top of a of a block that will

170
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:01,539
just over top of a of a block that will
 

171
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,330
just over top of a of a block that will
melt but solid snow blocks do not melt

172
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,340
melt but solid snow blocks do not melt
 

173
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,409

still maybe the snow just made it dark
 

213
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,600
still maybe the snow just made it dark
that's probably what it was all right

214
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,610
that's probably what it was all right
 

215
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,310
that's probably what it was all right
well I'm gonna skip ahead then okay back

216
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:38,320
well I'm gonna skip ahead then okay back
 

217
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,580
well I'm gonna skip ahead then okay back
to the color schemes so colors I'm

218
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:41,590
to the color schemes so colors I'm
 

219
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,650
to the color schemes so colors I'm
thinking of using our possibly this blue

220
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:43,660
thinking of using our possibly this blue
 

221
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,490
thinking of using our possibly this blue
I think it kind of goes good with snow

222
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,500
I think it kind of goes good with snow
 

223
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,740
I think it kind of goes good with snow
there's this blue as well I kind of go

224
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:55,750
there's this blue as well I kind of go
 

225
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,200
there's this blue as well I kind of go
good together I think and with ice I'll

226
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,210
good together I think and with ice I'll
 

227
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,900
good together I think and with ice I'll
probably use some of that also I think

228
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:03,910
probably use some of that also I think
 

229
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,320
probably use some of that also I think
black hole will look pretty sharp with

230
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,330
black hole will look pretty sharp with
 

231
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,320
black hole will look pretty sharp with
snow oh yeah in case you didn't know

232
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,330
snow oh yeah in case you didn't know

this using shears is a lot faster way of

234
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:16,840
this using shears is a lot faster way of
 

235
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,310
this using shears is a lot faster way of
picking up wool blocks so normally takes

236
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,320
picking up wool blocks so normally takes
 

237
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,190
picking up wool blocks so normally takes
that long with shears it's almost

238
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,200
that long with shears it's almost
 

239
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,260
that long with shears it's almost
instant just in case you didn't know

240
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,270

 

241
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,740

I may also like try greens reds I like

242
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:31,750
I may also like try greens reds I like
 

243
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,770
I may also like try greens reds I like
the purple you know pretty much anything

244
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:34,780
the purple you know pretty much anything
 

245
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,920
the purple you know pretty much anything
goes with white really but let me know

246
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:37,930
goes with white really but let me know
 

247
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,080
goes with white really but let me know
what you guys think I'm not entirely I'm

248
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,090
what you guys think I'm not entirely I'm
 

249
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,720
what you guys think I'm not entirely I'm
not entirely sure what I'm gonna do for

250
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:45,730
not entirely sure what I'm gonna do for
 

251
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,730
not entirely sure what I'm gonna do for
colors so give me your ideas and I will

252
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:50,740
colors so give me your ideas and I will
 

253
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,790
colors so give me your ideas and I will
probably follow them so when I started

254
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
probably follow them so when I started
 

255
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,410
probably follow them so when I started
this base here I was expecting it to

256
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:58,420
this base here I was expecting it to
 

257
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,810
this base here I was expecting it to
come together pretty quick but it's

258
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:00,820
come together pretty quick but it's
 

259
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,500
come together pretty quick but it's
taking a long time to build stuff as it

260
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,510
taking a long time to build stuff as it
 

261
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,320
taking a long time to build stuff as it
turns out there's a lot of work to it

262
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,330
turns out there's a lot of work to it
 

263
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,610
turns out there's a lot of work to it
really the next step in building my plan

264
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:11,620
really the next step in building my plan
 

265
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,360
really the next step in building my plan
here is to redo the flooring which I'll

266
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,370
here is to redo the flooring which I'll
 

267
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,750
here is to redo the flooring which I'll
hopefully get to this episode and then

268
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:18,760
hopefully get to this episode and then
 

269
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,910
hopefully get to this episode and then
after that we get to do some fun stuff

270
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:20,920
after that we get to do some fun stuff
 

271
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,280
after that we get to do some fun stuff
for you to build the passive mob

272
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,290
for you to build the passive mob
 

273
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,040
for you to build the passive mob
spawning pads and also the hostile mob

274
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,050
spawning pads and also the hostile mob
 

275
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,890
spawning pads and also the hostile mob
spawning pads the reason why I can't

276
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:31,900
spawning pads the reason why I can't
 

277
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,110
spawning pads the reason why I can't
start the hostile spawning pad yet is

278
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
start the hostile spawning pad yet is
 

279
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,480
start the hostile spawning pad yet is
because I have lots of cave systems to

280
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,490
because I have lots of cave systems to
 

281
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,570
because I have lots of cave systems to
explore yet before they will be

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:38,580
explore yet before they will be
 

283
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,600
explore yet before they will be
effective and the reason why I don't

284
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:42,610
effective and the reason why I don't

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,030
grass patch there is because of this
 

289
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,170
grass patch there is because of this

what I need to get rid of it goes all

320
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
what I need to get rid of it goes all
 

321
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
what I need to get rid of it goes all
the way along here so I think what I'm

322
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:53,890
the way along here so I think what I'm
 

323
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:02,750
the way along here so I think what I'm
gonna do is just dig down one block and

324
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:02,760
gonna do is just dig down one block and
 

325
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:11,250
gonna do is just dig down one block and
dig out one wide block marker for my

326
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:11,260
dig out one wide block marker for my
 

327
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,560
dig out one wide block marker for my
entire land mass here that's how I'll

328
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:13,570
entire land mass here that's how I'll
 

329
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,440
entire land mass here that's how I'll
know where to stop digging

330
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,450
know where to stop digging
 

331
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,800
know where to stop digging
when I'm underground I'll run into this

332
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:18,810
when I'm underground I'll run into this
 

333
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,329
when I'm underground I'll run into this
hollow hollow spots so I'm gonna do that

334
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:24,339
hollow hollow spots so I'm gonna do that
 

335
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:32,430
hollow hollow spots so I'm gonna do that
right now so the marker is dug now it's

336
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:32,440
right now so the marker is dug now it's
 

337
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,439
right now so the marker is dug now it's
just one wide so when I'm digging

338
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,449
just one wide so when I'm digging
 

339
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,319
just one wide so when I'm digging
tunnels underground to lay the TNT

340
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:40,329
tunnels underground to lay the TNT
 

341
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,110
tunnels underground to lay the TNT
charges I'm gonna come to this opening

342
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
charges I'm gonna come to this opening
 

343
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,819
charges I'm gonna come to this opening
and that's how I'm gonna know when to

344
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:44,829
and that's how I'm gonna know when to
 

345
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,280
and that's how I'm gonna know when to
stop digging otherwise I'll just keep

346
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,290
stop digging otherwise I'll just keep
 

347
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,990
stop digging otherwise I'll just keep
digging further and further in this

348
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,000
digging further and further in this
 

349
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,970
digging further and further in this
direction and wasting time so I'll come

350
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:53,980
direction and wasting time so I'll come
 

351
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,519
direction and wasting time so I'll come
to this opening a little to stop and

352
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:56,529
to this opening a little to stop and
 

353
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:02,069
to this opening a little to stop and
I'll stop and just digging this one wide

354
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
I'll stop and just digging this one wide
 

355
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
I'll stop and just digging this one wide
gap all through the islands or

356
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:04,810
gap all through the islands or
 

357
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,579
gap all through the islands or
landmass took between five and ten

358
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:08,589
landmass took between five and ten
 

359
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,560
landmass took between five and ten
minutes so we have to use TNT there's no

360
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,570
minutes so we have to use TNT there's no
 

361
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,990
minutes so we have to use TNT there's no
way I can dig out all this land it would

362
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
way I can dig out all this land it would
 

363
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,100
way I can dig out all this land it would
take way too long if one one block whit

364
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,110
take way too long if one one block whit
 

365
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,350
take way too long if one one block whit
takes that long so we're gonna use TNT

366
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360

 

367
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,949

and it just goes all the way through so

368
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:31,959
and it just goes all the way through so
 

369
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,389
and it just goes all the way through so
I gotta get rid of everything to the

370
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:33,399
I gotta get rid of everything to the
 

371
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,560
I gotta get rid of everything to the
right and any low stuff I'll use a

372
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:37,570
right and any low stuff I'll use a
 

373
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,590
right and any low stuff I'll use a
shovel on like stuff like that I don't

374
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,600
shovel on like stuff like that I don't
 

375
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,439
shovel on like stuff like that I don't
need to blow up but anything thick like

376
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:43,449
need to blow up but anything thick like
 

377
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:45,750
need to blow up but anything thick like
this needs TNT

378
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
this needs TNT
 

379
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,129
this needs TNT
so maybe we'll start laying maybe we'll

380
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:50,139
so maybe we'll start laying maybe we'll
 

381
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,319
so maybe we'll start laying maybe we'll
start doing a little bit of tunneling

382
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:54,329

 

383
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,430

okay so I'm just quickly going to show

384
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,440
okay so I'm just quickly going to show
 

385
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,530
okay so I'm just quickly going to show
you the method I plan on using to your

386
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:58,540
you the method I plan on using to your
 

387
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,680
you the method I plan on using to your
to this island so what I'll do is I'll

388
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:01,690
to this island so what I'll do is I'll
 

389
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,800
to this island so what I'll do is I'll
just dig a tunnel like this

390
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:06,810
just dig a tunnel like this
 

391
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,269
just dig a tunnel like this
I'll dig it all the way through until I

392
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
I'll dig it all the way through until I
 

393
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,620
I'll dig it all the way through until I
reach that opening one wide gap that I

394
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,630
reach that opening one wide gap that I
 

395
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,530
reach that opening one wide gap that I
just dug and I'll AT&T charges and

396
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:16,540
just dug and I'll AT&T charges and
 

397
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,800
just dug and I'll AT&T charges and
that's then two blocks over there'll be

398
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:19,810
that's then two blocks over there'll be
 

399
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,120
that's then two blocks over there'll be
another tunnel that goes all the way to

400
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,130
another tunnel that goes all the way to
 

401
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:29,340
another tunnel that goes all the way to
the end anywhere there's a stone ground

402
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,350
the end anywhere there's a stone ground
 

403
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,150
the end anywhere there's a stone ground
like this I'm fine but if I run into

404
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
like this I'm fine but if I run into
 

405
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,400
like this I'm fine but if I run into
dirt like like this I might need to

406
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,410
dirt like like this I might need to
 

407
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,280
dirt like like this I might need to
replace it with cobblestone so that I

408
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,290
replace it with cobblestone so that I
 

409
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,699
replace it with cobblestone so that I
get a clean explosion otherwise it's

410
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:41,709
get a clean explosion otherwise it's
 

411
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,810
get a clean explosion otherwise it's
gonna make a deep hole so I do that and

412
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:45,820
gonna make a deep hole so I do that and
 

413
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,740
gonna make a deep hole so I do that and
then let's see what would it be I would

414
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:52,750
then let's see what would it be I would
 

415
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,629
then let's see what would it be I would
go two blocks up there would be another

416
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
go two blocks up there would be another
 

417
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,439
go two blocks up there would be another
tunnel here and I'll go all the way to

418
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:01,449
tunnel here and I'll go all the way to
 

419
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:07,410
tunnel here and I'll go all the way to
the opening and two blocks over same

420
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:07,420
the opening and two blocks over same
 

421
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:16,800
the opening and two blocks over same
thing so basically each hint TNT tunnel

422
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:16,810
thing so basically each hint TNT tunnel
 

423
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:24,000
thing so basically each hint TNT tunnel
I dig here is gonna blow out a three by

424
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,010
I dig here is gonna blow out a three by
 

425
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,699
I dig here is gonna blow out a three by
four high area so that's how it's gonna

426
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:29,709
four high area so that's how it's gonna
 

427
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:29,970
four high area so that's how it's gonna
work

428
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:29,980
work
 

429
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:41,009
work
so another tunnel will go here and then

430
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:41,019
so another tunnel will go here and then
 

431
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,100
so another tunnel will go here and then
I'd lay all the TNT and somehow try to

432
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,110
I'd lay all the TNT and somehow try to
 

433
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,540
I'd lay all the TNT and somehow try to
activate oh did I do that wrong yeah

434
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,550
activate oh did I do that wrong yeah
 

435
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,710
activate oh did I do that wrong yeah
this one's supposed to be one block

436
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:49,720
this one's supposed to be one block
 

437
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,740
this one's supposed to be one block
lower yeah made a mistake there anyway

438
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:55,750
lower yeah made a mistake there anyway
 

439
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,120
lower yeah made a mistake there anyway
that's the plant so I do that all the

440
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,130
that's the plant so I do that all the
 

441
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,500
that's the plant so I do that all the
way

442
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,510
way
 

443
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,550
way
cross the island place all the TNT

444
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560

 

445
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,170

probably hundreds and hundreds of TNT

446
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:07,180
probably hundreds and hundreds of TNT
 

447
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:17,250
probably hundreds and hundreds of TNT
and then it'll all blow up somehow there

448
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,260
and then it'll all blow up somehow there
 

449
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,730
and then it'll all blow up somehow there
we go so I marked the position of all

450
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:20,740
we go so I marked the position of all
 

451
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,680
we go so I marked the position of all
the tunnels or at least a lot of the

452
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,690
the tunnels or at least a lot of the
 

453
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,790
the tunnels or at least a lot of the
tunnels I still need a few more marked

454
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:25,800
tunnels I still need a few more marked
 

455
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,960
tunnels I still need a few more marked
they don't go all the way through yet

456
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,970
they don't go all the way through yet
 

457
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,610
they don't go all the way through yet
I'll have to do that later sometime

458
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:29,620
I'll have to do that later sometime
 

459
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,439
I'll have to do that later sometime
they'll take a bit of time but that's

460
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:33,449
they'll take a bit of time but that's
 

461
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,670
they'll take a bit of time but that's
those are all the tunnels I need to dig

462
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
those are all the tunnels I need to dig
 

463
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,740
those are all the tunnels I need to dig
out to that one wide gap we made all

464
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:40,750
out to that one wide gap we made all
 

465
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,460
out to that one wide gap we made all
along here need to line them with TNT

466
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,470
along here need to line them with TNT
 

467
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,670
along here need to line them with TNT
and then I plan on detonating that's

468
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
and then I plan on detonating that's
 

469
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,069
and then I plan on detonating that's
from the top down hopefully I think will

470
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:53,079
from the top down hopefully I think will
 

471
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,220
from the top down hopefully I think will
work best and somehow I'll hook them all

472
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,230
work best and somehow I'll hook them all
 

473
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,750
work best and somehow I'll hook them all
together

474
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:56,760
together
 

475
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,530
together
maybe with fire I might make like a fire

476
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:01,540
maybe with fire I might make like a fire
 

477

high check that out there's a mushroom
on that tree pretty rare to see that

488
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:46,500

 

489
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500

cut down all these trees but that's what

492
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:51,790
cut down all these trees but that's what
 

493
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,199
cut down all these trees but that's what
I need to do and then I'll collect the

494
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:55,209
I need to do and then I'll collect the
 

495
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,379
I need to do and then I'll collect the
saplings and that's one less thing I

496
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:58,389
saplings and that's one less thing I
 

497
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,350
saplings and that's one less thing I
need to do before we can blow up this

498
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
need to do before we can blow up this
 

499
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,970
need to do before we can blow up this
island

500
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:05,980

 

501
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,740

okay I just finished there were a lot of

502
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:10,750
okay I just finished there were a lot of
 

503
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,540
okay I just finished there were a lot of
trees actually took a while but as you

504
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:15,550
trees actually took a while but as you
 

505
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,170
trees actually took a while but as you
can see this land is as barren as your

506
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,180
can see this land is as barren as your
 

507
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,570
can see this land is as barren as your
mom nothing left no more trees except

508
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:24,580
mom nothing left no more trees except
 

509
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,770

that our cobblestone barrier there this

510
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:28,780
that our cobblestone barrier there this
 

511
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,920
that our cobblestone barrier there this
is what I got one two three four five

512
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:33,930
is what I got one two three four five
 

513
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,410
is what I got one two three four five
about six stacks of wood and something

514
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,420
about six stacks of wood and something
 

515
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,090
about six stacks of wood and something
that's kind of confusing me is I blew

516
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,100
that's kind of confusing me is I blew
 

517
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,690
that's kind of confusing me is I blew
through about one and a half iron axes

518
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:45,700
through about one and a half iron axes
 

519
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,770
through about one and a half iron axes
cutting down all those trees I'm pretty

520
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:49,780
cutting down all those trees I'm pretty
 

521
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,040
cutting down all those trees I'm pretty
sure and like in my normal regular wood

522
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,050
sure and like in my normal regular wood
 

523
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,000
sure and like in my normal regular wood
tree farm I will collect about two and a

524
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,010
tree farm I will collect about two and a
 

525
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,000
tree farm I will collect about two and a
half stacks of wood with one iron axe so

526
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,010
half stacks of wood with one iron axe so
 

527
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,140
half stacks of wood with one iron axe so
assuming that's right something is wrong

528
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,150
assuming that's right something is wrong
 

529
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,280
assuming that's right something is wrong
here I'm have a theory that collecting

530
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,290
here I'm have a theory that collecting
 

531
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,310
here I'm have a theory that collecting
this dark wood doesn't use your axe up

532
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,320
this dark wood doesn't use your axe up
 

533
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,579
this dark wood doesn't use your axe up
as much as collecting regular wood but I

534
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:14,589
as much as collecting regular wood but I
 

535
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,780
as much as collecting regular wood but I
don't want to start any rumors about

536
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:15,790
don't want to start any rumors about
 

537
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,230
don't want to start any rumors about
that maybe someone will research it and

538
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,240
that maybe someone will research it and
 

539
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,470
that maybe someone will research it and
let us know in the comments and if

540
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
let us know in the comments and if
 

541
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,170
let us know in the comments and if
nobody does I'll probably do it myself

542
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,180

 

543
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,460

so I'm going to keep prepping that

544
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:29,470
so I'm going to keep prepping that
 

545
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,010
so I'm going to keep prepping that
Island for its destruction and maybe

546
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,020
Island for its destruction and maybe
 

547
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,350
Island for its destruction and maybe
hopefully next episode we'll blow it up

548
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,360
hopefully next episode we'll blow it up
 

549
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,310
hopefully next episode we'll blow it up
or maybe two episodes or something from

550
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
or maybe two episodes or something from
 

551
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,630
or maybe two episodes or something from
now whenever it gets done but let's

552
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
now whenever it gets done but let's
 

553
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,850
now whenever it gets done but let's
let's get back to this floor here so

554
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:44,860
let's get back to this floor here so
 

555
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,220
let's get back to this floor here so
originally I was gonna have the openings

556
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,230
originally I was gonna have the openings
 

557
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,160
originally I was gonna have the openings
set up like this there's Pistons one

558
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,170
set up like this there's Pistons one
 

559
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,420
set up like this there's Pistons one
piston underneath this half slab here

560
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,430

 

561
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,540

and I was gonna open the block something

562
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,550
and I was gonna open the block something
 

563
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,370
and I was gonna open the block something
like that so that when the water comes

564
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:03,380
like that so that when the water comes
 

565
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,400
like that so that when the water comes
out it'll flow to this hole spreading

566
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,410
out it'll flow to this hole spreading
 

567
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,060
out it'll flow to this hole spreading
everywhere but I have been shown a

568
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,070
everywhere but I have been shown a
 

569
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,380
everywhere but I have been shown a
cooler way of doing this now by Haan s

570
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,390
cooler way of doing this now by Haan s
 

571
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,100
cooler way of doing this now by Haan s
ihe I believe his name is pronounced

572
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,110
ihe I believe his name is pronounced
 

573
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,660
ihe I believe his name is pronounced
hand SIA possibly he came up with this

574
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:25,670
hand SIA possibly he came up with this
 

575
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,240
hand SIA possibly he came up with this
little design here which is very very

576
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,250
little design here which is very very
 

577
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,950
little design here which is very very
cool so we have three sticky pistons

578
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
cool so we have three sticky pistons
 

579
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,780
cool so we have three sticky pistons
here two going this way and one going up

580
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:36,790
here two going this way and one going up
 

581
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,000
here two going this way and one going up
and when this is activated this block

582
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,010
and when this is activated this block
 

583
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,610
and when this is activated this block
here goes over one and up one and when

584
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:45,620
here goes over one and up one and when
 

585
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,160
here goes over one and up one and when
you flip it back it retracts so that is

586
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,170
you flip it back it retracts so that is
 

587
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,620
you flip it back it retracts so that is
very very cool and you have to send

588
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,630
very very cool and you have to send
 

589
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,330
very very cool and you have to send
power to this block here it lights it

590
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,340
power to this block here it lights it
 

591
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,620
power to this block here it lights it
activates this repeater which is set to

592
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:02,630
activates this repeater which is set to
 

593
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,650
activates this repeater which is set to
two activates this block and this

594
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:05,660
two activates this block and this
 

595
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,000
two activates this block and this
redstone above so this is gonna work a

596
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,010
redstone above so this is gonna work a
 

597
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,570
redstone above so this is gonna work a
lot better for the floor hopefully

598
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:12,580
lot better for the floor hopefully
 

599
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,260
lot better for the floor hopefully
because for for example we're gonna make

600
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,270
because for for example we're gonna make
 

601
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,840
because for for example we're gonna make
this our pretend floor so when it's

602
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:25,850
this our pretend floor so when it's
 

603
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,320
this our pretend floor so when it's
closed the ground will be completely

604
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,330
closed the ground will be completely
 

605
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,600
closed the ground will be completely
flat and when it's open we'll have a

606
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:34,610
flat and when it's open we'll have a
 

607
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,820
flat and when it's open we'll have a
nice hole that the water and items will

608
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:36,830
nice hole that the water and items will
 

609
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,549
nice hole that the water and items will
flow down so should work out pretty nice

610
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
flow down so should work out pretty nice
 

611
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,990
flow down so should work out pretty nice
it's a lot better than having the half

612
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
it's a lot better than having the half
 

613
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,870
it's a lot better than having the half
slabs sticking out of the ground

614
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:45,880
slabs sticking out of the ground
 

615
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,370
slabs sticking out of the ground
so this is what I plan on using so

616
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:51,380
so this is what I plan on using so
 

617
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,250
so this is what I plan on using so
unfortunately to use that new design I

618
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,260
unfortunately to use that new design I
 

619
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,000
unfortunately to use that new design I
need to rip out this floor which kind of

620
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,010
need to rip out this floor which kind of
 

621
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,860
need to rip out this floor which kind of
sucks because I spent a bit of time on

622
00:19:59,860 --> 00:19:59,870
sucks because I spent a bit of time on
 

623
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,190
sucks because I spent a bit of time on
our a bit of time on it already mostly

624
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
our a bit of time on it already mostly
 

625
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,490
our a bit of time on it already mostly
on setting up these canals these with

626
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:06,500
on setting up these canals these with
 

627
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,289
on setting up these canals these with
the ice underneath

628
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:09,299

 

629
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,470

I'm gonna have to make a new ice layer

630
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
I'm gonna have to make a new ice layer
 

631
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,190
I'm gonna have to make a new ice layer
three blocks below this one so yeah that

632
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
three blocks below this one so yeah that
 

633
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,880
three blocks below this one so yeah that
kind of sucks but it's worth it so I

634
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:25,890
kind of sucks but it's worth it so I
 

635
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,730
kind of sucks but it's worth it so I
gotta get rid of all these stuff

636
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:27,740
gotta get rid of all these stuff
 

637
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:34,270
gotta get rid of all these stuff
all these snow blocks all the water

638
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,280

 

639
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,710

broke I should probably have gotten rid

640
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
broke I should probably have gotten rid
 

641
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,080
broke I should probably have gotten rid
of the water first and when I do that

642
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,090
of the water first and when I do that
 

643
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:47,090
of the water first and when I do that
I'll be back so this is where we're at

644
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,100
I'll be back so this is where we're at
 

645
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,310
I'll be back so this is where we're at
now I got rid of all that junk under the

646
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,320
now I got rid of all that junk under the
 

647
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,450
now I got rid of all that junk under the
ice and I made a new molding filled it

648
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:53,460
ice and I made a new molding filled it
 

649
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,710
ice and I made a new molding filled it
with water so when this ice is gone this

650
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:57,720
with water so when this ice is gone this
 

651
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,600
with water so when this ice is gone this
water will freeze and we'll have a new

652
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,610
water will freeze and we'll have a new
 

653
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:08,090
water will freeze and we'll have a new
layer of ice underneath here so I got

654
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,100
layer of ice underneath here so I got
 

655
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,650
layer of ice underneath here so I got
that all done now the top layer of ice

656
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:09,660
that all done now the top layer of ice
 

657
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,710
that all done now the top layer of ice
is gone we have a newly formed lower

658
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
is gone we have a newly formed lower
 

659
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
is gone we have a newly formed lower
layer here and I play soil blocks

660
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:16,730
layer here and I play soil blocks
 

661
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,150
layer here and I play soil blocks
everywhere that I need the collection

662
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,160
everywhere that I need the collection
 

663
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,980
everywhere that I need the collection
point to be that's what these are

664
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:21,990
point to be that's what these are
 

665
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,060
point to be that's what these are
marking and now need to try make and

666
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,070
marking and now need to try make and
 

667
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,900
marking and now need to try make and
sighs I guess he didn't really give it a

668
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:32,910
sighs I guess he didn't really give it a
 

669
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,140
sighs I guess he didn't really give it a
name but his setup thing I need to try

670
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,150
name but his setup thing I need to try
 

671
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,510
name but his setup thing I need to try
get that working so I think this is how

672
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
get that working so I think this is how
 

673
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,470
get that working so I think this is how
he had it and then there's gonna be two

674
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:45,480
he had it and then there's gonna be two
 

675
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,539
he had it and then there's gonna be two
blocks and a repeater between so just

676
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:53,549
blocks and a repeater between so just
 

677
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,530
blocks and a repeater between so just
like this maybe get rid of ice

678
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,540
like this maybe get rid of ice
 

679
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,470
like this maybe get rid of ice
and let's see how to do this thing I

680
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
and let's see how to do this thing I
 

681
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,910
and let's see how to do this thing I
think there is that there and a repeater

682
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:08,920

 

683
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,430

- and I'm just going to use a lever for

684
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:12,440
- and I'm just going to use a lever for
 

685
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:22,450
- and I'm just going to use a lever for
now just to test this yeah that looks

686
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:22,460
now just to test this yeah that looks
 

687
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,980
now just to test this yeah that looks
good

688
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:25,990

 

689
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,220

okay

690
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,230
okay
 

691
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:32,470
okay
so we got that but we also need to set

692
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
so we got that but we also need to set
 

693
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,140
so we got that but we also need to set
up water streams to order this and the

694
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,150
up water streams to order this and the
 

695
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,100
up water streams to order this and the
problem with that is I can't just place

696
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,110
problem with that is I can't just place
 

697
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,650
problem with that is I can't just place
a water block here because when the

698
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:44,660
a water block here because when the
 

699
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,260
a water block here because when the
piston moves its gonna destroy that

700
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,270
piston moves its gonna destroy that
 

701
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,900
piston moves its gonna destroy that
water block so I'm gonna put a water

702
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:49,910
water block so I'm gonna put a water
 

703
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,240
water block so I'm gonna put a water
block here instead be something like

704
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,250
block here instead be something like
 

705
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,720
block here instead be something like
this see let's close this the water will

706
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:01,730
this see let's close this the water will
 

707
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:12,970
this see let's close this the water will
be here I'll make it flow out

708
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:12,980

 

709
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,250

so flow out and then maybe make it flow

710
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,260
so flow out and then maybe make it flow
 

711
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,880
so flow out and then maybe make it flow
a little bit more and have a wall here

712
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:22,890
a little bit more and have a wall here
 

713
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:31,520
a little bit more and have a wall here
it'll be like a sign here let's put our

714
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,530
it'll be like a sign here let's put our
 

715
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:37,670
it'll be like a sign here let's put our
lever back where it belongs so when this

716
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:37,680
lever back where it belongs so when this
 

717
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,590
lever back where it belongs so when this
is up that won't freeze this will be

718
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:42,600
is up that won't freeze this will be
 

719
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,240
is up that won't freeze this will be
covered while that froze fast

720
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,250
covered while that froze fast
 

721
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,300
covered while that froze fast
yeah and that's up the water block will

722
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,310
yeah and that's up the water block will
 

723
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:54,170
yeah and that's up the water block will
be like this when it's down it'll flow

724
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,180
be like this when it's down it'll flow
 

725
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:06,350
be like this when it's down it'll flow
out when the items fall the items will

726
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,360
out when the items fall the items will
 

727
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,420
out when the items fall the items will
be come to that point they're fall and

728
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:11,430
be come to that point they're fall and
 

729
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,890
be come to that point they're fall and
then they'll slide out here and then

730
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:15,900
then they'll slide out here and then
 

731
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,870
then they'll slide out here and then
I'll just have like one main water

732
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
I'll just have like one main water
 

733
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,980
I'll just have like one main water
stream here going this way all the way

734
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:24,990
stream here going this way all the way
 

735
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,160
stream here going this way all the way
to the end and so the items will flow

736
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,170
to the end and so the items will flow
 

737
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,740
to the end and so the items will flow
like this I'll go around and this will

738
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:33,750
like this I'll go around and this will
 

739
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,610
like this I'll go around and this will
shoot them out

740
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:38,620

 

741
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:48,850

yeah hope that makes sense all right so

742
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:48,860
yeah hope that makes sense all right so
 

743
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,930
yeah hope that makes sense all right so
I think I know what I'm gonna do here

744
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:49,940
I think I know what I'm gonna do here
 

745
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,610
I think I know what I'm gonna do here
the only thing I need to figure out is

746
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:51,620
the only thing I need to figure out is
 

747
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,840
the only thing I need to figure out is
how to run a wire to this block here

748
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:55,850
how to run a wire to this block here
 

749
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,909
how to run a wire to this block here
from from the second lever this one here

750
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:02,919
from from the second lever this one here
 

751
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,340
from from the second lever this one here
so maybe we'll say that for another day

752
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,350
so maybe we'll say that for another day
 

753
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,850
so maybe we'll say that for another day
this episodes being long beautiful

754
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:11,860
this episodes being long beautiful
 

755
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,490
this episodes being long beautiful
sunsets and so this floor is gonna be

756
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:18,500
sunsets and so this floor is gonna be
 

757
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,220
sunsets and so this floor is gonna be
replaced by something probably something

758
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,230
replaced by something probably something
 

759
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,919
replaced by something probably something
different than ice help figure out

760
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:22,929
different than ice help figure out
 

761
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,299
different than ice help figure out
pattern hopefully that looks cool

762
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:25,309
pattern hopefully that looks cool
 

763
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:26,980
pattern hopefully that looks cool
maybe with wool blocks of different

764
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:26,990
maybe with wool blocks of different
 

765
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,119
maybe with wool blocks of different
colors and hopefully it'll be good if

766
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,129
colors and hopefully it'll be good if
 

767
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:35,200
colors and hopefully it'll be good if
you have ideas let me know and I'm going

768
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,210
you have ideas let me know and I'm going
 

769
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,879
you have ideas let me know and I'm going
to say goodbye thank you for watching

770
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:36,889
to say goodbye thank you for watching
 

771
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:40,240
to say goodbye thank you for watching
until next time
