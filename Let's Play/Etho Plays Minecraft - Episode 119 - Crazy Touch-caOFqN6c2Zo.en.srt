in fact a few of the signs have been

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:24,600
in fact a few of the signs have been
 

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
in fact a few of the signs have been
blown up already and they keep coming

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,810
blown up already and they keep coming
 

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,519
blown up already and they keep coming
back for more

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:30,529

the tree farms not don't shoot their
 

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,620
the tree farms not don't shoot their
tree farms not done yet I'll hopefully

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:36,630
tree farms not done yet I'll hopefully
 

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,720
tree farms not done yet I'll hopefully
get around to doing that soon I figure

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:38,730
get around to doing that soon I figure
 

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,840
get around to doing that soon I figure
once I finished figuring out all the

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:41,850
once I finished figuring out all the
 

23
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,660
once I finished figuring out all the
donations stuff I will put my world up

this is I think this will work anyway if

90
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:37,860
this is I think this will work anyway if
 

91
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,770
this is I think this will work anyway if
I take from the middle of here yeah it

92
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,780
I take from the middle of here yeah it
 

93
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,930
I take from the middle of here yeah it
seems to be fixed well I guess we should

94
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:44,940
seems to be fixed well I guess we should
 

95
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,729
seems to be fixed well I guess we should
do a proper test here let's do the plus

96
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:46,739
do a proper test here let's do the plus
 

97
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,270

yet now and I want to see if it's true

170
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,570
yet now and I want to see if it's true
 

171
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,750
yet now and I want to see if it's true
or not because normally you get four or

172
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:19,760
or not because normally you get four or
 

173
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:27,040
or not because normally you get four or
five from redstone wait I think that's

174
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,050
five from redstone wait I think that's
 

175
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,580
five from redstone wait I think that's
six is it six it's six awesome not much

176
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:33,590
six is it six it's six awesome not much
 

177
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,320

178
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,330
of an improvement but it's that's four
 

179
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,230

twenty-two not quite six on average five
 

183
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,230
twenty-two not quite six on average five
blocks we got twenty eight so that's

184
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
blocks we got twenty eight so that's
 

185
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,100
blocks we got twenty eight so that's
just over five on average I was hoping

186
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,110
just over five on average I was hoping
 

187
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,630
just over five on average I was hoping

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,990
want to try it on spawners even though I
don't I thought I heard the creeper even

484
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
don't I thought I heard the creeper even
 

485
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,429
don't I thought I heard the creeper even
though I don't plan on using it if it

486
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:09,439
though I don't plan on using it if it
 

487
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:13,749
though I don't plan on using it if it
works even I know it works on glass oh

488
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
works even I know it works on glass oh
 

489
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,129
works even I know it works on glass oh
yeah glowstone glowstone it works on

490
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:18,139
yeah glowstone glowstone it works on
 

491
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,389
yeah glowstone glowstone it works on
glowstone so I think I should probably

492
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
glowstone so I think I should probably
 

493
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,060
glowstone so I think I should probably
mmm

494
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,070
mmm
 

495
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,470
mmm
when I go to harvest glowstone I should

496
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,480
when I go to harvest glowstone I should
 

497
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,090
when I go to harvest glowstone I should
probably bring my silk touch with me

498
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,100
probably bring my silk touch with me
 

499
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,440
probably bring my silk touch with me
because it'll save some pieces otherwise

500
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,450
because it'll save some pieces otherwise
 

501
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,170
because it'll save some pieces otherwise
I think it's I'm going to check right

502
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,180
I think it's I'm going to check right
 

503
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,130
I think it's I'm going to check right
now yeah I checked then the range is you

504
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,140
now yeah I checked then the range is you
 

505
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,470
now yeah I checked then the range is you
get two to four glowstone dust if you

506
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
get two to four glowstone dust if you
 

507
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,900
get two to four glowstone dust if you
break glowstone arm ly so if you use

508
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:42,910
break glowstone arm ly so if you use
 

509
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,260
break glowstone arm ly so if you use
silk touch there's definitely no loss

510
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,270
silk touch there's definitely no loss
 

511
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,070
silk touch there's definitely no loss
and the other day I saw one of these

that should be fine yeah so we're going
 

647
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,200
that should be fine yeah so we're going
to start a base here and that's why I

648
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,210
to start a base here and that's why I
 

649
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,600
to start a base here and that's why I
wanted this grass and hopefully we can

650
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:04,610
wanted this grass and hopefully we can
 

651
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,940

this is still in the game and have grass

654
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:13,970
this is still in the game and have grass
 

655
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,770
this is still in the game and have grass
in the nether gate what's the deal

656
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:16,780
in the nether gate what's the deal
 

657
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:22,960
in the nether gate what's the deal
million torches there

658
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:22,970

they're still spawning so I'll have to

664
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,330
they're still spawning so I'll have to
 

665
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,980
they're still spawning so I'll have to
deal with it another day yet the grass

666
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:36,990
deal with it another day yet the grass
 

667
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,200
deal with it another day yet the grass
is spreading here I tried and it's

668
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,210
is spreading here I tried and it's
 

669
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,640
is spreading here I tried and it's
spreading nicely which is good so yeah

670
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:43,650
spreading nicely which is good so yeah
 

671
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,990

672
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,000

 

673
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,180

so we will be able to have grass in the

674
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,190
so we will be able to have grass in the
 

675
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,790
so we will be able to have grass in the
nether and if we find ice will it be

676
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:52,800
nether and if we find ice will it be
 

677
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,810
nether and if we find ice will it be
able to have water

678
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:53,820
able to have water
 

679
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,860
able to have water
I believe if that's still in the game

680
00:21:59,860 --> 00:21:59,870

 

681
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,430
