00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,730
you can use bone meal to instantly grow
 

57
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,210
you can use bone meal to instantly grow
trees and wheat so I want to experiment

58
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
trees and wheat so I want to experiment
 

59
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:28,089
trees and wheat so I want to experiment
with that first first was the trees and

60
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:28,099
with that first first was the trees and
 

61
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,949
with that first first was the trees and
looks like a good spot plant the tree

62
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
looks like a good spot plant the tree
 

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,420
looks like a good spot plant the tree
I've heard you need to stand back from

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,430
I've heard you need to stand back from
 

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,550

it otherwise it can suffocate you yeah
 

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,860
it otherwise it can suffocate you yeah
that's pretty cool I'll just leave it so

68
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:48,870
that's pretty cool I'll just leave it so
 

69
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,180
that's pretty cool I'll just leave it so
that worked pretty cool next thing I

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,190
that worked pretty cool next thing I
 

71
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,099
that worked pretty cool next thing I
wanted to try that's the first time I've

72
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:58,109
wanted to try that's the first time I've
 

73
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,979
wanted to try that's the first time I've
seen that by the way the next thing I

74
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:00,989
seen that by the way the next thing I
 

75
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,060
seen that by the way the next thing I
wanted to try is to see if it'll grow in

76
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,070
wanted to try is to see if it'll grow in
 

77
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,789
wanted to try is to see if it'll grow in
[Music]

78
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:12,799

 

79
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:20,270

it'll grow in a compact space so I got a

80
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,280
it'll grow in a compact space so I got a
 

81
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,309
it'll grow in a compact space so I got a
block here so the leaves are going to be

82
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
block here so the leaves are going to be
 

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,350
block here so the leaves are going to be
forced to be

84
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,360

 

85
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,200

actually let's do it like this the

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,210
actually let's do it like this the
 

87
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,640
actually let's do it like this the
leaves will have to be forced to be

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:34,650
leaves will have to be forced to be
 

89
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:49,160
leaves will have to be forced to be
three blocks high minimum interesting so

90
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,170
three blocks high minimum interesting so
 

91
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,890
three blocks high minimum interesting so
it does work but you have to use several

92
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:51,900
it does work but you have to use several
 

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:04,040
it does work but you have to use several
bonemeal until until the random tree

94
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,050
bonemeal until until the random tree
 

95
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:10,490
bonemeal until until the random tree
fits the space and we're going to try

96
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:10,500
fits the space and we're going to try
 

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:10,970
fits the space and we're going to try
another one

98
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:10,980
another one
 

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:29,180
another one
a two tree don't really know what shape

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
a two tree don't really know what shape
 

101
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:46,550
a two tree don't really know what shape
I'm making here this is pretty cool if

102
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm making here this is pretty cool if
 

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm making here this is pretty cool if
it you can grow a [ __ ] trees using

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,690
it you can grow a [ __ ] trees using
 

105
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:57,490
it you can grow a [ __ ] trees using
bonemeal 1/2 second try that's cool and

106
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,500
bonemeal 1/2 second try that's cool and
 

107
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:13,399
bonemeal 1/2 second try that's cool and
we got ourselves a [ __ ] tree

108
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:13,409

 

109
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:21,689

I'm definitely liking the bonemeal that

110
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:21,699
I'm definitely liking the bonemeal that
 

111
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:28,709
I'm definitely liking the bonemeal that
beautiful [ __ ] tree that's nice okay

112
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:28,719
beautiful [ __ ] tree that's nice okay
 

113
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:33,029
beautiful [ __ ] tree that's nice okay
what did I want to try next let's find

114
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
what did I want to try next let's find
 

115
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:43,589
what did I want to try next let's find
someplace with some more grass yeah the

116
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:43,599
someplace with some more grass yeah the
 

117
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:49,799
someplace with some more grass yeah the
next thing I wanted to try is that since

118
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:49,809
next thing I wanted to try is that since
 

119
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:55,350
next thing I wanted to try is that since
[ __ ] trees work we're going to dig a

120
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
[ __ ] trees work we're going to dig a
 

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,179
[ __ ] trees work we're going to dig a
hole

122
00:05:59,179 --> 00:05:59,189

 

123
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,119

creeper check look safe we're going to

124
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,129
creeper check look safe we're going to
 

125
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,989
creeper check look safe we're going to
dig a hole actually that's probably too

126
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:06,999
dig a hole actually that's probably too
 

127
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:15,269
dig a hole actually that's probably too
deep how many is that one two three four

128
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:15,279
deep how many is that one two three four
 

129
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,469
deep how many is that one two three four
oh it's good we've got a soil block

130
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:19,479
oh it's good we've got a soil block
 

131
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,399
oh it's good we've got a soil block
there we're going to place our sapling

132
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:23,409
there we're going to place our sapling
 

133
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,909
there we're going to place our sapling
on it and what we're going to do is try

134
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
on it and what we're going to do is try
 

135
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:38,040
on it and what we're going to do is try
to create Minecraft hedges or bushes

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,050
to create Minecraft hedges or bushes
 

137
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,799
to create Minecraft hedges or bushes
type things so we're going to place a

138
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:42,809
type things so we're going to place a
 

139
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:50,399
type things so we're going to place a
limiter above our tree so the highest it

140
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,409
limiter above our tree so the highest it
 

141
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:54,509
limiter above our tree so the highest it
can grow is a up to here and we're going

142
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:54,519
can grow is a up to here and we're going
 

143
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,159
can grow is a up to here and we're going
to place our bonemeal it might kill me I

144
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,169
to place our bonemeal it might kill me I
 

145
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,889
to place our bonemeal it might kill me I
don't know one two three four five six

146
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:01,899
don't know one two three four five six
 

147
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:13,650
don't know one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten whoa all right

148
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:13,660
seven eight nine ten whoa all right
 

149
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,910
seven eight nine ten whoa all right
so it's a little bit dangerous to do it

150
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:15,920
so it's a little bit dangerous to do it
 

151
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
so it's a little bit dangerous to do it
that way but I'm sure there's a safe way

152
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:17,690
that way but I'm sure there's a safe way
 

153
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,360
that way but I'm sure there's a safe way
to do it too and now we got this little

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,370
to do it too and now we got this little
 

155
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:30,000
to do it too and now we got this little
leaf itch at ground level and we can

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,010

 

157
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:39,340

take our leaf cutter and shape it

158
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,350
take our leaf cutter and shape it
 

159
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,310
take our leaf cutter and shape it
however we want

160
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,320

 

161
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,000

and for example make little hedges at

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,010

too and I think it might be possible to

328
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,329
too and I think it might be possible to
 

329
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,579
too and I think it might be possible to
make it automatic for them because they

330
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:35,589
make it automatic for them because they
 

331
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,650
make it automatic for them because they
all have different sizes according to

332
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:37,660
all have different sizes according to
 

333
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,179
all have different sizes according to
the wiki and I know for a fact you can

334
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:45,189
the wiki and I know for a fact you can

do this
 

341
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:03,150
do this
experiment to get this before because

342
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,160
experiment to get this before because
 

343
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,030
