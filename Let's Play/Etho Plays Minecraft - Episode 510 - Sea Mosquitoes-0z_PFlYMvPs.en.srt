bit would do how it would affect the the

92
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,180
bit would do how it would affect the the
 

93
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,300
bit would do how it would affect the the
mob spawning and all that if there was

94
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,310
mob spawning and all that if there was
 

95
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,710
mob spawning and all that if there was
like a hard limit to how many would

96
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:45,720
like a hard limit to how many would
 

97
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,360
like a hard limit to how many would
spawn things like that I was curious

98
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,370

 

99
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,710

103
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,190
my issue at the moment is I can kill
these guys and basically at the speed I

104
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,200
these guys and basically at the speed I
 

105
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,110
these guys and basically at the speed I
kill them there's more and they distract

106
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
kill them there's more and they distract
 

107
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,600
kill them there's more and they distract
me from miles away so I kind of kicked

me from miles away so I kind of kicked
 

109
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,630
me from miles away so I kind of kicked
out of this area right now this is so

110
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:11,640
out of this area right now this is so
 

111
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,449
out of this area right now this is so
many of them because all the caves are

112
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:14,459
many of them because all the caves are
 

113
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,620
many of them because all the caves are
lit up so now they're spawning in the

114
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,630
lit up so now they're spawning in the
 

115
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,789
lit up so now they're spawning in the
water right oh we gotta tried to do okay

Trident we found they'll all fixed up

144
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:57,780
Trident we found they'll all fixed up
 

145
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,449
Trident we found they'll all fixed up
here so I put mending on it I got

146
00:03:59,449 --> 00:03:59,459
here so I put mending on it I got
 

147
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,260
here so I put mending on it I got
impaling

148
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,270
impaling
 

149
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,770
impaling
four and Riptide three right now I

150
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:02,780
four and Riptide three right now I
 

151
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,630
four and Riptide three right now I
thought these would work a little bit

152
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:05,640
thought these would work a little bit
 

153
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,510
thought these would work a little bit
better under the water to be honest

154
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,520
better under the water to be honest
 

155
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,620
better under the water to be honest
because the big problem is if you're

156
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:09,630
because the big problem is if you're
 

157
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,240
because the big problem is if you're
underwater and you're swimming you can't

158
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,250
underwater and you're swimming you can't
 

159
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,570
underwater and you're swimming you can't
you can't use your rockets until you

160
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:14,580
you can't use your rockets until you
 

161
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,729
you can't use your rockets until you
activate the light wings which you can't

162
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:16,739
activate the light wings which you can't
 

163
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,860
activate the light wings which you can't
do underwater you have to go to the

164
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:18,870
do underwater you have to go to the
 

165
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,820
do underwater you have to go to the
surface to do that and then like then if

166
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:22,830
surface to do that and then like then if
 

167
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,460
surface to do that and then like then if
you fly under the water then you can use

168
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,470
you fly under the water then you can use
 

169
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,230
you fly under the water then you can use
it right I was kind of hoping that the

170
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
it right I was kind of hoping that the
 

171
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,640
it right I was kind of hoping that the
Riptide would make it a little easier to

172
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:31,650
Riptide would make it a little easier to
 

173
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,140
Riptide would make it a little easier to
swim but you only move like I should

174
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,150
swim but you only move like I should
 

175
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,910
swim but you only move like I should
check but it's not like five or ten

176
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:37,920
check but it's not like five or ten
 

177
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,490
check but it's not like five or ten
blocks or something which is not super

178
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
blocks or something which is not super
 

179
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,190
blocks or something which is not super
great it is really good above the water

180
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,200
great it is really good above the water
 

181
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,790
great it is really good above the water
though it's incredible because then you

182
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
though it's incredible because then you
 

183
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,880
though it's incredible because then you
can activate your wings with it and

184
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:48,890
can activate your wings with it and
 

185
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,810
can activate your wings with it and
basically fly without using rockets

186
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:52,820
basically fly without using rockets
 

187
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,090
basically fly without using rockets
right or can not throw it again so guy

maybe let's let's go in this mode yeah

216
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,030
maybe let's let's go in this mode yeah
 

217
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,190
maybe let's let's go in this mode yeah
it only hits one so it's not like yeah

218
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,200
it only hits one so it's not like yeah

221
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
it's not like you're going bowling or
anything and knocking them all down so

222
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:49,770
anything and knocking them all down so
 

223
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,620
anything and knocking them all down so
it's not super effective against the big

224
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:51,630
it's not super effective against the big
 

225
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,380
it's not super effective against the big
pack so I guess they always drop them

226
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,390
pack so I guess they always drop them
 

227
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,520
pack so I guess they always drop them
out of the shell because it's in their

228
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,530
out of the shell because it's in their
 

229
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,750
out of the shell because it's in their
offhand it's a guaranteed drop alright

230
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:02,760
offhand it's a guaranteed drop alright
 

231
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,050
offhand it's a guaranteed drop alright

it's not going away pretty cool so every

544
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,570
it's not going away pretty cool so every
 

545
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,320
it's not going away pretty cool so every
seven blocks you add to this increases

546
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,330
seven blocks you add to this increases
 

547
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,770
seven blocks you add to this increases
its range by 16 blocks and it goes up to

548
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:04,780
its range by 16 blocks and it goes up to
 

549
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,400
its range by 16 blocks and it goes up to
ninety six blocks range if you have 42

550
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,410
ninety six blocks range if you have 42
 

551
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,190
ninety six blocks range if you have 42
blocks in the frame so what would this

552
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:11,200
blocks in the frame so what would this
 

553
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,160
blocks in the frame so what would this
be five by five by six 16

554
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,170
be five by five by six 16
 

555
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,040
be five by five by six 16
26 up to 30 blocks right now so we need

556
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,050
26 up to 30 blocks right now so we need
 

557
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,030
26 up to 30 blocks right now so we need
to add 12 more in order to max it out so

558
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,040
to add 12 more in order to max it out so
 

559
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,250
to add 12 more in order to max it out so

system a dark room at the very least
 

709
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,030
system a dark room at the very least
where the mobs can spawn and they'll

710
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,040
where the mobs can spawn and they'll
 

711
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,799
where the mobs can spawn and they'll
they'll stop spawning in the water and

712
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:07,809
they'll stop spawning in the water and
 

713
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,730
they'll stop spawning in the water and
annoying us rights we want to trap them

714
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:11,740
annoying us rights we want to trap them
 

715
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,870
annoying us rights we want to trap them
I wanted to maybe see if we can make an

716
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:15,880
I wanted to maybe see if we can make an
 

717
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,910
I wanted to maybe see if we can make an
old-school mob system with the water

718
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:17,920
old-school mob system with the water
 

719
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,610
old-school mob system with the water
elevators last one I made like that I

720
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:20,620
elevators last one I made like that I
 

721
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,260
elevators last one I made like that I
think was like on the minecraft server

722
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,270
think was like on the minecraft server
 

723
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,820
think was like on the minecraft server
in the ethos lab and thinking about it

724
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:26,830
in the ethos lab and thinking about it
 

725
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,440
in the ethos lab and thinking about it
here I have to go into creative a bit to

726
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,450
here I have to go into creative a bit to
 

727
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,150
here I have to go into creative a bit to
play around with it it's actually really

728
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
play around with it it's actually really
 

729
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,530
play around with it it's actually really
difficult to do one like that now

730
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:31,540
difficult to do one like that now
 

731
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,630
difficult to do one like that now
because zombies and skeletons they don't

732
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:33,640
because zombies and skeletons they don't
 

733
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,250
because zombies and skeletons they don't
float in water anymore so how are you

734
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,260
float in water anymore so how are you
 

735
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,600
float in water anymore so how are you
gonna send them up a water elevator

736
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,610
gonna send them up a water elevator
 

737
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,710
gonna send them up a water elevator
rights you got to use the bubble streams

738
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:39,720
rights you got to use the bubble streams
 

739
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,660
rights you got to use the bubble streams
but the problem with the bubble streams

740
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:42,670
but the problem with the bubble streams
 

741
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,720
but the problem with the bubble streams
is you have to have it all source water

742
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:45,730
is you have to have it all source water
 

743
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,450
is you have to have it all source water
blocks in order you get the bubbles you

744
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:48,460
blocks in order you get the bubbles you
 

745
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,120
blocks in order you get the bubbles you
see like these don't have the bubbles it

746
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,130
see like these don't have the bubbles it
 

747
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,600
see like these don't have the bubbles it
still it's got the water sources there

748
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:54,610
still it's got the water sources there
 

749
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,570
still it's got the water sources there
now they spread uh-huh so how do you

750
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,580
now they spread uh-huh so how do you
 

751
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:06,690
now they spread uh-huh so how do you
forcefully send mobs into the stream

752
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:06,700
forcefully send mobs into the stream
 

753
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,820
forcefully send mobs into the stream
here is the question because if we try

754
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:08,830
here is the question because if we try
 

755
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,410
here is the question because if we try
to connect like a water bucket up to

756
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:10,420
to connect like a water bucket up to
 

757
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,230
to connect like a water bucket up to
this you see the water goes this way

758
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,240
this you see the water goes this way
 

759
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
this you see the water goes this way
because the water water comes out here

760
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,490
because the water water comes out here
 

761
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,520
because the water water comes out here
and forces it this way right so it's

762
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:20,530
and forces it this way right so it's
 

763
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,400
and forces it this way right so it's
gonna be a bit tricky I think I figured

764
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,410
gonna be a bit tricky I think I figured
 

765
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,340
gonna be a bit tricky I think I figured
out a way of doing it okay this is

766
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,350
out a way of doing it okay this is
 

767
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,810
out a way of doing it okay this is
really weird I'm trying to fill up the

768
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:27,820
really weird I'm trying to fill up the
 

769
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,940
really weird I'm trying to fill up the
water elevator here with water source

770
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:29,950
water elevator here with water source
 

771
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,320
water elevator here with water source
blocks because most of this is just

772
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,330
blocks because most of this is just
 

773
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,350
blocks because most of this is just
downward flowing water right now you

774
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:34,360
downward flowing water right now you
 

775
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,669
downward flowing water right now you
need the source box for the bubble

776
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
need the source box for the bubble
 

777
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,250
need the source box for the bubble
stream so the way I'd do it I think I

778
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,260
stream so the way I'd do it I think I
 

779
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,430
stream so the way I'd do it I think I
left off at this level here take one

780
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
left off at this level here take one
 

781
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,280
left off at this level here take one
from there put it up we just moved up a

782
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,290
from there put it up we just moved up a
 

783
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,570
from there put it up we just moved up a
block

784
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:50,580

 

785
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,830

it's a bubble scream to get higher kind

786
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:54,840
it's a bubble scream to get higher kind
 

787
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:04,550
it's a bubble scream to get higher kind
of weird right and it's done okay so let

788
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:04,560
of weird right and it's done okay so let
 

789
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,290
of weird right and it's done okay so let
me try show you the gizmo I came up with

790
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,300
me try show you the gizmo I came up with
 

791
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,910
me try show you the gizmo I came up with
here they get them into the water

792
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:07,920
here they get them into the water
 

793
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,640
here they get them into the water
elevator so let's say we have a water

794
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:10,650
elevator so let's say we have a water
 

795
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,410
elevator so let's say we have a water
stream we want to go this way

796
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,420
stream we want to go this way
 

797
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,840
stream we want to go this way
and push them into here you see the

798
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:14,850
and push them into here you see the
 

799
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,610
and push them into here you see the
water streams taking us into the middle

800
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,620
water streams taking us into the middle
 

801
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,340
water streams taking us into the middle
though that's not what we want so what

802
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,350
though that's not what we want so what
 

803
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,770
though that's not what we want so what
you got to do I think to get this glass

804
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:21,780
you got to do I think to get this glass
 

805
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,240
you got to do I think to get this glass
here and over there we're gonna put a

806
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,250
here and over there we're gonna put a
 

807
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,700
here and over there we're gonna put a
trap door let's see trap door yeah

808
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,710
trap door let's see trap door yeah
 

809
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,070
trap door let's see trap door yeah
facing down like that so now if we

810
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,080
facing down like that so now if we
 

811
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,710
facing down like that so now if we
remove that stone kind of hold some of

812
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
remove that stone kind of hold some of
 

813
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,840
remove that stone kind of hold some of
the water in place we're gonna want to

814
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:38,850
the water in place we're gonna want to
 

815
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,590
the water in place we're gonna want to
dig down 2 blocks here and at that

816
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:42,600
dig down 2 blocks here and at that
 

817
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,300
dig down 2 blocks here and at that
bottom level there there's gonna be a

818
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,310
bottom level there there's gonna be a
 

819
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,920
bottom level there there's gonna be a
pressure plate so when they step on the

820
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:45,930
pressure plate so when they step on the
 

821
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,510
pressure plate so when they step on the
pressure plate it's gonna activate a

822
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
pressure plate it's gonna activate a
 

823
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,120
pressure plate it's gonna activate a
piston to shove them into the elevator

824
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,130
piston to shove them into the elevator
 

825
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,930
piston to shove them into the elevator
try to guarantee it happens right that

826
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:53,940
try to guarantee it happens right that
 

827
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,570
try to guarantee it happens right that
piston is going to be over here and we

828
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,580
piston is going to be over here and we
 

829
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,420
piston is going to be over here and we
want to use a specific oh I knew that's

830
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,430
want to use a specific oh I knew that's
 

831
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,030
want to use a specific oh I knew that's
gonna happen at least once like once you

832
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,040
gonna happen at least once like once you
 

833
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,920
gonna happen at least once like once you
start going up you can't fight it let's

834
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:06,930
start going up you can't fight it let's
 

835
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,130
start going up you can't fight it let's
open it wouldn't because it takes like

836
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,140
open it wouldn't because it takes like
 

837
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,440
open it wouldn't because it takes like
15 seconds to get back down there it's

838
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,450
15 seconds to get back down there it's
 

839
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,440
15 seconds to get back down there it's
alright it's alright

840
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,450
alright it's alright
 

841
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,060
alright it's alright
I'll let you guys know how I'm getting

842
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,070
I'll let you guys know how I'm getting
 

843
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,430
I'll let you guys know how I'm getting
in and out of here I guess

844
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,440
in and out of here I guess
 

845
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,560
in and out of here I guess
okay let's try not do that again be very

846
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,570
okay let's try not do that again be very
 

847
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,070
okay let's try not do that again be very
careful I don't step into the elevator

848
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
careful I don't step into the elevator
 

849
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,310
careful I don't step into the elevator
yeah

850
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,320
yeah
 

851
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,120
yeah
pistons gonna be there and what we want

852
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,130
pistons gonna be there and what we want
 

853
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:36,110
pistons gonna be there and what we want
to do is also put a sign here right so

854
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,120
to do is also put a sign here right so
 

855
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,270
to do is also put a sign here right so
they'll get pushed off off the edge here

856
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,280
they'll get pushed off off the edge here
 

857
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,450
they'll get pushed off off the edge here
the water they'll fall into here step on

858
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:41,460
the water they'll fall into here step on
 

859
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,710
the water they'll fall into here step on
the pressure plate and then this will

860
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
the pressure plate and then this will
 

861
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,320
the pressure plate and then this will
push them into the water sweet and we

862
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,330
push them into the water sweet and we
 

863
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,030
push them into the water sweet and we
got to connect this pressure plate up to

864
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,040
got to connect this pressure plate up to
 

865
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,620
got to connect this pressure plate up to
the piston here so one way you can do

866
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:48,630
the piston here so one way you can do
 

867
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,870
the piston here so one way you can do
that pretty simple here or the way I'm

868
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
that pretty simple here or the way I'm
 

869
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,370
that pretty simple here or the way I'm
gonna do it probably is this repeater

870
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,380
gonna do it probably is this repeater
 

871
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,800
gonna do it probably is this repeater
there with some redstone running up the

872
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:54,810
there with some redstone running up the
 

873
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,020
there with some redstone running up the
stairs here so that'll power this block

874
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,030
stairs here so that'll power this block
 

875
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,690
stairs here so that'll power this block
which in powers of piston rights we

876
00:21:59,690 --> 00:21:59,700
which in powers of piston rights we
 

877
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,140
which in powers of piston rights we
didn't seal this up then and it looks

878
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,150
didn't seal this up then and it looks
 

879
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,340
didn't seal this up then and it looks
like that's good to go

880
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,350
like that's good to go
 

881
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,620
like that's good to go
like that'll be fine for witches

882
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:06,630
like that'll be fine for witches
 

883
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,070
like that'll be fine for witches
skeletons and zombies but this setup

884
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
skeletons and zombies but this setup
 

885
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,140
skeletons and zombies but this setup
actually has issues with creepers and

886
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,150
actually has issues with creepers and
 

887
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,029
actually has issues with creepers and
baby zombies as I found out in my

888
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:14,039
baby zombies as I found out in my
 

889
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,789
baby zombies as I found out in my
testing you see that's kind of like what

890
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
testing you see that's kind of like what
 

891
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,640
testing you see that's kind of like what
it does there so creepers and baby

892
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,650
it does there so creepers and baby
 

893
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,560
it does there so creepers and baby
zombies they're a little bit smaller and

894
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,570
zombies they're a little bit smaller and
 

895
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,760
zombies they're a little bit smaller and
because of that they kind of gets stuck

896
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:24,770
because of that they kind of gets stuck
 

897
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,870
because of that they kind of gets stuck
so I'll show you what we got to do with

898
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
so I'll show you what we got to do with
 

899
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,700
so I'll show you what we got to do with
them yeah as the creepers they'll kind

900
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:31,710
them yeah as the creepers they'll kind
 

901
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,230
them yeah as the creepers they'll kind
of like jump up and down in this water

902
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
of like jump up and down in this water
 

903
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,210
of like jump up and down in this water
here sometimes they step on the pressure

904
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,220
here sometimes they step on the pressure
 

905
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,560
here sometimes they step on the pressure
plate but sometimes they don't and

906
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,570
plate but sometimes they don't and
 

907
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,620
plate but sometimes they don't and
they'll just kind of get stuck here it

908
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,630
they'll just kind of get stuck here it
 

909
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,970
they'll just kind of get stuck here it
would be really good if we could get rid

910
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:40,980
would be really good if we could get rid
 

911
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,039
would be really good if we could get rid
of this this water here but we can't

912
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,049
of this this water here but we can't
 

913
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,289
of this this water here but we can't
really because we need the water source

914
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:45,299
really because we need the water source
 

915
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,140
really because we need the water source
next to it but I found out a trick we

916
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,150
next to it but I found out a trick we
 

917
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,720
next to it but I found out a trick we
could do here as well all we got to do

918
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:49,730
could do here as well all we got to do
 

919
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,560
could do here as well all we got to do
same thing is up here trapdoor like this

920
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:54,570
same thing is up here trapdoor like this
 

921
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,169
same thing is up here trapdoor like this
right that block there still a water

922
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:57,179
right that block there still a water
 

923
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,669
right that block there still a water
source that way and the bubble stream

924
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:58,679
source that way and the bubble stream
 

925
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,980
source that way and the bubble stream
still goes up but now we have like an

926
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:00,990
still goes up but now we have like an
 

927
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,070
still goes up but now we have like an
air space here so creepers won't jump up

928
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
air space here so creepers won't jump up
 

929
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,039
air space here so creepers won't jump up
and down water let us fall down sticky

930
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,049
and down water let us fall down sticky
 

931
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,169
and down water let us fall down sticky
piston will push a trapdoor there and

932
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:09,179
piston will push a trapdoor there and
 

933
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,720
piston will push a trapdoor there and
then it pulls it back that's all good

934
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:11,730
then it pulls it back that's all good
 

935
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,799
then it pulls it back that's all good
the only problem is when this pulls back

936
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:15,809
the only problem is when this pulls back
 

937
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:21,830
the only problem is when this pulls back
I'm gonna go up to me man I can't show

938
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm gonna go up to me man I can't show
 

939
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,470
I'm gonna go up to me man I can't show
you without doing that problem is when I

940
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
you without doing that problem is when I
 

941
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,909
you without doing that problem is when I
pulls the trapdoor back it's in the

942
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
pulls the trapdoor back it's in the
 

943
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,700
pulls the trapdoor back it's in the
wrong position that's good don't check

944
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:28,710
wrong position that's good don't check
 

945
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,799
wrong position that's good don't check
that yeah so now when the next guy comes

946
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:33,809
that yeah so now when the next guy comes
 

947
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,090
that yeah so now when the next guy comes
by he's gonna get stuck over here

948
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,100
by he's gonna get stuck over here
 

949
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,880
by he's gonna get stuck over here
alright so what we got to do is just

950
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:37,890
alright so what we got to do is just
 

951
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,560
alright so what we got to do is just
change this to like a redstone block or

952
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:39,570
change this to like a redstone block or
 

953
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,039
change this to like a redstone block or
something that way it stays stays like

954
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,049
something that way it stays stays like
 

955
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,680
something that way it stays stays like
that and that's good to go that'll

956
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:45,690
that and that's good to go that'll
 

957
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,299
that and that's good to go that'll
handle the creepers then for the baby

958
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:47,309
handle the creepers then for the baby
 

959
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,720
handle the creepers then for the baby
zombies what I'm gonna do is actually

960
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:50,730
zombies what I'm gonna do is actually
 

961
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,549
zombies what I'm gonna do is actually
change that block there to make my block

962
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
change that block there to make my block
 

963
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,510
change that block there to make my block
because they'll get stuck on this

964
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:56,520
because they'll get stuck on this
 

965
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,240
because they'll get stuck on this
pressure plate keep the piston extended

966
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,250
pressure plate keep the piston extended
 

967
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,799
pressure plate keep the piston extended
and

968
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:00,809
and
 

969
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,690
and
just be a real nuisance right but this

970
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:05,700
just be a real nuisance right but this
 

971
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,159
just be a real nuisance right but this
way if we have the magma block there

972
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:07,169
way if we have the magma block there
 

973
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,830
way if we have the magma block there
they'll eventually die at least and I'm

974
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
they'll eventually die at least and I'm
 

975
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,769
they'll eventually die at least and I'm
gonna try that out with the system so

976
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:12,779
gonna try that out with the system so
 

977
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,119
gonna try that out with the system so
basically that's good to go I'm just

978
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,129
basically that's good to go I'm just
 

979
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:15,680
basically that's good to go I'm just
gonna have to build the spawning pads

980
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:15,690
gonna have to build the spawning pads
 

981
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:24,379
gonna have to build the spawning pads
now and stuff a few more of those noise

982
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:24,389
now and stuff a few more of those noise
 

983
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:29,289
now and stuff a few more of those noise
I really like this trident naturally

984
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:29,299
I really like this trident naturally
 

985
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,340
I really like this trident naturally
alright guys so this is like an hour

986
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,350
alright guys so this is like an hour
 

987
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,739
alright guys so this is like an hour
later now check it out we got ourselves

988
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:33,749
later now check it out we got ourselves
 

989
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:37,850
later now check it out we got ourselves
some spawning pads here the hard part of

990
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:37,860
some spawning pads here the hard part of
 

991
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,470
some spawning pads here the hard part of
this was figuring out a good pattern to

992
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
this was figuring out a good pattern to
 

993
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,259
this was figuring out a good pattern to
use I don't know if this is a great

994
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:42,269
use I don't know if this is a great
 

995
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:44,090
use I don't know if this is a great
pattern but it's gonna work there's no

996
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,100
pattern but it's gonna work there's no
 

997
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,009
pattern but it's gonna work there's no
dead zones in the water streams that was

998
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:46,019
dead zones in the water streams that was
 

999
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,529
dead zones in the water streams that was
the tricky parts and it's a spiral

1000
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:48,539
the tricky parts and it's a spiral
 

1001
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,389
the tricky parts and it's a spiral
pattern which is what really confused me

1002
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:50,399
pattern which is what really confused me
 

1003
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,269
pattern which is what really confused me
but I think that got it okay here so a

1004
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
but I think that got it okay here so a
 

1005
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,960
but I think that got it okay here so a
couple key features of the spawning room

1006
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:55,970
couple key features of the spawning room
 

1007
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,639
couple key features of the spawning room
all the water streams go to the main

1008
00:24:58,639 --> 00:24:58,649
all the water streams go to the main
 

1009
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,700
all the water streams go to the main
channels obviously there's four four

1010
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,710
channels obviously there's four four
 

1011
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,340
channels obviously there's four four
ways to get into the elevator around

1012
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,350
ways to get into the elevator around
 

1013
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:09,560
ways to get into the elevator around
around here all right rose and we got

1014
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,570
around here all right rose and we got
 

1015
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,629
around here all right rose and we got
carpets in places here that's to prevent

1016
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:11,639
carpets in places here that's to prevent
 

1017
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:14,029
carpets in places here that's to prevent
spiders from spawning and then in these

1018
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:14,039
spiders from spawning and then in these
 

1019
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,100
spiders from spawning and then in these
areas where there's connections between

1020
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,110
areas where there's connections between
 

1021
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,950
areas where there's connections between
the water streams basically I got a slab

1022
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
the water streams basically I got a slab
 

1023
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,499
the water streams basically I got a slab
here and then a sign here to hold the

1024
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:21,509
here and then a sign here to hold the
 

1025
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:24,070
here and then a sign here to hold the
water source from flowing back this way

1026
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
water source from flowing back this way
 

1027
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,350
water source from flowing back this way
right and then above these I put some

1028
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
right and then above these I put some
 

1029
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,450
right and then above these I put some
slabs as well so that hopefully when the

1030
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,460
slabs as well so that hopefully when the
 

1031
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,639
slabs as well so that hopefully when the
mobs go in the connections they don't

1032
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:31,649
mobs go in the connections they don't
 

1033
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:35,389
mobs go in the connections they don't
jump back onto the pads and and like

1034
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:35,399
jump back onto the pads and and like
 

1035
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,399
jump back onto the pads and and like
never get to the elevator right want to

1036
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:37,409
never get to the elevator right want to
 

1037
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,369
never get to the elevator right want to
keep them moving so I think we're good

1038
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:40,379
keep them moving so I think we're good
 

1039
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:44,600
keep them moving so I think we're good
to go here I think we're gonna go try it

1040
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:44,610
to go here I think we're gonna go try it
 

1041
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,560
to go here I think we're gonna go try it
out so I'm gonna go up the elevator

1042
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,570
out so I'm gonna go up the elevator
 

1043
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,149
out so I'm gonna go up the elevator
myself

1044
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
myself
 

1045
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,399
myself
is it we still got Bubble streams it

1046
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:51,409
is it we still got Bubble streams it
 

1047
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:54,070
is it we still got Bubble streams it
doesn't rekt anything let's just spend a

1048
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
doesn't rekt anything let's just spend a
 

1049
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,110
doesn't rekt anything let's just spend a
couple moments up here and then we'll go

1050
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,120
couple moments up here and then we'll go
 

1051
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,730
couple moments up here and then we'll go
back down there should be some mobs

1052
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:57,740
back down there should be some mobs
 

1053
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,890
back down there should be some mobs
there a little moment to spawn I still

1054
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:02,900
there a little moment to spawn I still
 

1055
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,270
there a little moment to spawn I still
got the torches in so it's not gonna

1056
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,280
got the torches in so it's not gonna
 

1057
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,890
got the torches in so it's not gonna
spawn it to to many hopefully all right

1058
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:08,900
spawn it to to many hopefully all right
 

1059
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,840
spawn it to to many hopefully all right
oh I think the mob might be coming up I

1060
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,850
oh I think the mob might be coming up I
 

1061
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,220
oh I think the mob might be coming up I
see a break in the bubbles maybe oh is

1062
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,230
see a break in the bubbles maybe oh is
 

1063
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,740
see a break in the bubbles maybe oh is
cuz that's far away okay let's let's

1064
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:20,750
cuz that's far away okay let's let's
 

1065
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,560
cuz that's far away okay let's let's
just go down somebody's chasing me right

gonna take out the torches and then it's
 

1085
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:08,840
gonna take out the torches and then it's
gonna go crazy

1086
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:08,850

 

1087
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:18,680

okay slight problem with the system I

1100
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:39,640
okay slight problem with the system I
 

1101
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,800
okay slight problem with the system I
guess if the wrong trap doors extend at

1102
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:43,810
guess if the wrong trap doors extend at
 

1103
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,390
guess if the wrong trap doors extend at
the same time I guess it's gonna kill

1104
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:45,400
the same time I guess it's gonna kill
 

1105
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,600
the same time I guess it's gonna kill
the water sources and then the bubble

1106
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:48,610
the water sources and then the bubble
 

1107
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,580
the water sources and then the bubble
streams shut off permanently okay I got

1108
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:53,590
streams shut off permanently okay I got
 

1109
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,730
streams shut off permanently okay I got
to think about how to fix that now okay

1110
00:27:59,730 --> 00:27:59,740
to think about how to fix that now okay
 

1111
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,030
to think about how to fix that now okay
no they all converted at once you know

1112
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,040
no they all converted at once you know
 

1113

dark all of a sudden hello creepers nope

1122
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,240
dark all of a sudden hello creepers nope
 

1123
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,420
dark all of a sudden hello creepers nope
this is not where you should be ever

1124
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,430

 

1125
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,300

everything is fine nope torch is gone

1126
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,310
everything is fine nope torch is gone
 

1127
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,620
everything is fine nope torch is gone
everybody panic yeah so if I wasn't

1128
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,630
everybody panic yeah so if I wasn't
 

1129
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,170
everybody panic yeah so if I wasn't
clear basically the problem is if a

1130
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:43,180
clear basically the problem is if a
 

1131
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,410
clear basically the problem is if a
trapdoor extends into the bubble stream

1132
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:46,420
trapdoor extends into the bubble stream
 

1133
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,480
trapdoor extends into the bubble stream
and then another one also extends next

1134
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,490
and then another one also extends next
 

1135
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,840
and then another one also extends next
to it it's gonna destroy like the water

1136
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:51,850
to it it's gonna destroy like the water
 

1137
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,120
to it it's gonna destroy like the water
source there and there and then when it

1138
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,130
source there and there and then when it
 

1139
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,830
source there and there and then when it
retracts there's no water there anymore

1140
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:55,840
retracts there's no water there anymore
 

1141
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,000
retracts there's no water there anymore
to refill the area so a couple of ways

1142
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,010
to refill the area so a couple of ways
 

1143
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,930
to refill the area so a couple of ways
we can fix this

1144
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:00,940
we can fix this
 

1145
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,390
we can fix this
either we add some redstone control to

1146
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:03,400
either we add some redstone control to
 

1147
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,010
either we add some redstone control to
like not allow this one in this one

1148
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,020
like not allow this one in this one
 

1149
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,990
like not allow this one in this one
extend at the same time

1150
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,000
extend at the same time
 

1151
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,060
extend at the same time
or this one and the one next to it on

1152
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,070
or this one and the one next to it on
 

1153
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,960
or this one and the one next to it on
that side but the easiest way is just to

1154
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:12,970
that side but the easiest way is just to
 

1155
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,140
that side but the easiest way is just to
only allow mobs in on two sides at once

1156
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,150
only allow mobs in on two sides at once
 

1157
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,220
only allow mobs in on two sides at once
maximum so if we block this off here and

1158
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,230
maximum so if we block this off here and
 

1159
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,760
maximum so if we block this off here and
then lock it off on this side then it's

1160
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:23,770
then lock it off on this side then it's
 

1161
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,230
then lock it off on this side then it's
gonna always have two water sources

1162
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,240
gonna always have two water sources
 

1163
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,659
gonna always have two water sources
there to repopulate it

1164
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:30,669

 

1165
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,539

the downside obviously is like it's

1166
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:33,549
the downside obviously is like it's
 

1167
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:35,310
the downside obviously is like it's
gonna slow down the rate that we can get

1168
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,320
gonna slow down the rate that we can get
 

1169
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,409
gonna slow down the rate that we can get
them into the elevator here but I think

1170
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:37,419
them into the elevator here but I think
 

1171
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,440
them into the elevator here but I think
it'll be fine and also I got to redo the

1172
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,450
it'll be fine and also I got to redo the
 

1173
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,350
it'll be fine and also I got to redo the
water streams after I got them all

1174
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
water streams after I got them all
 

1175
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,470
water streams after I got them all
perfect we've got a direct them over

1176
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
perfect we've got a direct them over
 

1177
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,149
perfect we've got a direct them over
here now somehow okay well I did a

1178
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:51,159
here now somehow okay well I did a
 

1179
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,860
here now somehow okay well I did a
little bit of a hack job here I just

1180
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:52,870
little bit of a hack job here I just
 

1181
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,029
little bit of a hack job here I just
made it work our elegant waters stream

1182
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039
made it work our elegant waters stream
 

1183
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,630
made it work our elegant waters stream
system here is not really as good

1184
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
system here is not really as good
 

1185
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,520
system here is not really as good
anymore but it's fine look a giant

1186
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,530
anymore but it's fine look a giant
 

1187
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,610
anymore but it's fine look a giant
spawning pad here now and kind of some

1188
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:05,620
spawning pad here now and kind of some
 

1189
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,549
spawning pad here now and kind of some
sloppy carpets all condensed together

1190
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
sloppy carpets all condensed together
 

1191
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,110
sloppy carpets all condensed together
here but I had to do that to stop the

1192
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,120
here but I had to do that to stop the
 

1193
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,200
here but I had to do that to stop the
spiders from spawning but it'll be fine

1194
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,210
spiders from spawning but it'll be fine
 

1195
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,480
spiders from spawning but it'll be fine
I think it's okay when this is all done

1196
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,490
I think it's okay when this is all done
 

1197
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,919
I think it's okay when this is all done

I would like to have like two or three
 

1199
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:19,230
I would like to have like two or three
layers of the mob system as well not

1200
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,240
layers of the mob system as well not
 

1201
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,570
layers of the mob system as well not
just not just the one here but just for

1202
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:21,580
just not just the one here but just for

think oh yeah we got a skeleton up here
might have been that from there before

1216
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:43,480
might have been that from there before
 

1217
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,770
might have been that from there before
though give it a sec yeah

we're far enough oh yeah here comes a
 

1221
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:56,190
we're far enough oh yeah here comes a
creeper whoo all right so right now

1222
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,200
creeper whoo all right so right now
 

1223
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,870
creeper whoo all right so right now
there's kind of free flowing into the

1224
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:57,880
there's kind of free flowing into the
 

1225
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,340
there's kind of free flowing into the
ocean we'll also want to build like a

1226
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,350
ocean we'll also want to build like a
 

1227
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,230
ocean we'll also want to build like a
cage so that we can hold them in some

1228
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,240
cage so that we can hold them in some
 

1229
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,170
cage so that we can hold them in some
place - and they'll build up there and

1230
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:04,180
place - and they'll build up there and
 

1231
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,690
place - and they'll build up there and
once the mop town gets high there they

1232
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:06,700
once the mop town gets high there they
 

1233
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,860
once the mop town gets high there they
won't

1234
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:07,870
won't
 

1235
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,810
won't
the drown mobs won't spawn and the water

1236
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:09,820
the drown mobs won't spawn and the water
 

1237
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
the drown mobs won't spawn and the water
is often and everything will be good I

1238
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:11,830
is often and everything will be good I
 

1239
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:18,530
is often and everything will be good I
think I think we got two mobs three mom

1240
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:18,540
think I think we got two mobs three mom
 

1241
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,190
think I think we got two mobs three mom
kind of thought they would spawn a

1242
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,200
kind of thought they would spawn a
 

1243
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,370
kind of thought they would spawn a
little bit faster than that be honest

1244
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,380
little bit faster than that be honest
 

1245
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:29,760
little bit faster than that be honest
that's their jam dn do we dare did we go

1246
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:29,770
that's their jam dn do we dare did we go
 

1247
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:38,790
that's their jam dn do we dare did we go
check no I don't know if I can actually

1248
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:38,800
check no I don't know if I can actually
 

1249
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,390
check no I don't know if I can actually
fight the bubbles that creeper right

1250
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:42,400
fight the bubbles that creeper right
 

1251
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,000
fight the bubbles that creeper right
there um I want to see if it's jammed

1252
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,010
there um I want to see if it's jammed
 

1253
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:53,510
there um I want to see if it's jammed
but I don't want to go down there okay

1254
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:53,520

 

1255
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,670

lots of mobs the downside with this kind

1256
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:56,680
lots of mobs the downside with this kind
 

1257
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,460
lots of mobs the downside with this kind
of system as well is they kind of hang

1258
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,470
of system as well is they kind of hang
 

1259
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,300
of system as well is they kind of hang
out on the pads sometimes but the upside

1260
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,310
out on the pads sometimes but the upside
 

1261
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,500
out on the pads sometimes but the upside
is we don't need a million Pistons it

1262
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:07,510
is we don't need a million Pistons it
 

1263
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,670
is we don't need a million Pistons it
looks like they're taking the channels

1264
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:08,680
looks like they're taking the channels
 

1265
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,580
looks like they're taking the channels
pretty good you've been with me here

1266
