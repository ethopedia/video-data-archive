319
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,290
pretty pretty cool and a big effect on
the game yeah I'm having like I click on

320
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,300
the game yeah I'm having like I click on
 

321
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,790
the game yeah I'm having like I click on
this and then it doesn't pick it up

322
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
this and then it doesn't pick it up
 

323
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,179
this and then it doesn't pick it up
sometimes see that being very

324
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:52,189
sometimes see that being very
 

325
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:55,769
sometimes see that being very
frustrating if it doesn't change I

326
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:55,779
frustrating if it doesn't change I
 

327
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,759
frustrating if it doesn't change I
thought that's how you make the

328
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:57,769
thought that's how you make the
 

329
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,269
thought that's how you make the
day/night sensor I'll have to double

330
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
day/night sensor I'll have to double
 

331
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,170
day/night sensor I'll have to double
check

332
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,180
check
 

333
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,530
check
maybe maybe let's try mixing with other

334
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:05,540
maybe maybe let's try mixing with other
 

335
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:12,579
maybe maybe let's try mixing with other
stuff too I tap pick stuff up oh man is

336
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:12,589
stuff too I tap pick stuff up oh man is
 

337
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,910
stuff too I tap pick stuff up oh man is
brutal I figured we should move to a

338
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
brutal I figured we should move to a
 

339
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,290
brutal I figured we should move to a
spot where we have a little bit more

340
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,300
spot where we have a little bit more
 

341
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,480
spot where we have a little bit more
space so we're up here now I made two of

342
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,490
space so we're up here now I made two of
 

343
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,220
space so we're up here now I made two of
these already but I'll show you how to

344
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,230
these already but I'll show you how to
 

345
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,249
these already but I'll show you how to
do it just in case for some reason you

346
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:24,259
do it just in case for some reason you
 

347
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,040
do it just in case for some reason you
are not playing this amazing new

348
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,050
are not playing this amazing new
 

349
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,199
are not playing this amazing new
snapshot that's how you make the

350
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:29,209
snapshot that's how you make the
 

351
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,829
snapshot that's how you make the
redstone comparator I guess let's go

352
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:32,839
redstone comparator I guess let's go
 

353
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,290
redstone comparator I guess let's go
through all the stuff that was added

354
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,300
through all the stuff that was added
 

355
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,900
through all the stuff that was added
there's the gold weighted pressure plate

356
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:37,910
there's the gold weighted pressure plate
 

357
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,900
there's the gold weighted pressure plate
that's the light one there's also an

358
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:40,910
that's the light one there's also an
 

359
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,350
that's the light one there's also an
iron plated pressure plate that's the

360
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,360
iron plated pressure plate that's the
 

361
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,919
iron plated pressure plate that's the
heavy one there is the reason I was

362
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:47,929
heavy one there is the reason I was
 

363
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:51,610
heavy one there is the reason I was
having trouble with the the daylight

364
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:51,620
having trouble with the the daylight
 

365
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,329
having trouble with the the daylight
sensor I guess I was using these old oak

366
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:55,339
sensor I guess I was using these old oak
 

367
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,530
sensor I guess I was using these old oak
slabs the ones that didn't burn I just

368
00:10:59,530 --> 00:10:59,540
slabs the ones that didn't burn I just
 

369
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,360
slabs the ones that didn't burn I just
grabbed them from the chest they really

370
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,370
grabbed them from the chest they really
 

371
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,639
grabbed them from the chest they really
think about it if we use a new oak wood

372
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:03,649
think about it if we use a new oak wood
 

373
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,519
think about it if we use a new oak wood
slab then we can make it

374
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:05,529
slab then we can make it
 

375
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:12,739
slab then we can make it
and there's the redstone block oh boy

376
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:12,749

 

377
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:16,100

looks awesome then there's the trap

378
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,110
looks awesome then there's the trap
 

379
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,970
looks awesome then there's the trap
chest let's make a couple of those this

380
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:19,980
chest let's make a couple of those this
 

381
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,919
chest let's make a couple of those this
is a really excellent feature especially

382
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:21,929
is a really excellent feature especially
 

383
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,109
is a really excellent feature especially
for like custom maps and stuff oh man

384
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:26,119
for like custom maps and stuff oh man
 

385
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:32,030
for like custom maps and stuff oh man
CTM maps that's it I can't make the

386
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,040
CTM maps that's it I can't make the
 

387
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,590
CTM maps that's it I can't make the
hopper I think that's about it I'm

388
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
hopper I think that's about it I'm
 

389
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
hopper I think that's about it I'm
probably forgetting something it'll come

390
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:38,850
probably forgetting something it'll come
 

391
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,790
probably forgetting something it'll come
to me

392
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:39,800
to me
 

393
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,799
to me
all right well one I'll tell you what

394
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:42,809
all right well one I'll tell you what
 

395
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,569
all right well one I'll tell you what
happened when the update first came out

396
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:44,579
happened when the update first came out
 

397
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,759
happened when the update first came out
the thing I was most excited about was

398
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:46,769
the thing I was most excited about was
 

399
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,619
the thing I was most excited about was
the redstone block and looks pretty cool

400
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:51,629
the redstone block and looks pretty cool
 

401
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,269
the redstone block and looks pretty cool
it almost looks like it's giving off

402
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
it almost looks like it's giving off
 

403
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,329
it almost looks like it's giving off
light but it isn't it's got that glow to

404
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:56,339
light but it isn't it's got that glow to
 

405
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,980
light but it isn't it's got that glow to
it though just cool it's a way to store

406
00:11:59,980 --> 00:11:59,990
it though just cool it's a way to store
 

407
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,419
it though just cool it's a way to store
redstone in a compressed way not that I

408
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:02,429
redstone in a compressed way not that I
 

409
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:07,429
redstone in a compressed way not that I
ever have any that I need to yeah I was

410
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:07,439
ever have any that I need to yeah I was
 

411
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,720
ever have any that I need to yeah I was
excited about because I thought I was

412
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:08,730
excited about because I thought I was
 

413
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,249
excited about because I thought I was
going to be able to make it some awesome

414
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:10,259
going to be able to make it some awesome
 

415
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,530
going to be able to make it some awesome
conveyor belts some cool elevator and I

416
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,540
conveyor belts some cool elevator and I
 

417
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,150
conveyor belts some cool elevator and I
might be able to but it's not as simple

418
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
might be able to but it's not as simple
 

419
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,989
might be able to but it's not as simple
as I thought it was but acts like a

420
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:17,999
as I thought it was but acts like a
 

421
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:24,939
as I thought it was but acts like a
redstone torch very cool you can move it

422
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:24,949
redstone torch very cool you can move it
 

423
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,869
redstone torch very cool you can move it
with pistons this is a thing that sort

424
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:29,879
with pistons this is a thing that sort
 

425
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,460
with pistons this is a thing that sort
of disappointed me the most so and I

426
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,470
of disappointed me the most so and I
 

427
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,369
of disappointed me the most so and I
hope they change it if you put a

428
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:34,379
hope they change it if you put a
 

429
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,679
hope they change it if you put a
redstone block in front of a piston it

430
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:36,689
redstone block in front of a piston it
 

431
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,829
redstone block in front of a piston it
doesn't actually move it like it doesn't

432
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:38,839
doesn't actually move it like it doesn't
 

433
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,439
doesn't actually move it like it doesn't
it doesn't power the piston which is

434
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:42,449
it doesn't power the piston which is
 

435
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,600
it doesn't power the piston which is
really sad because it's like a

436
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:44,610
really sad because it's like a
 

437
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,439
really sad because it's like a
mechanical redstone torch and the idea

438
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:48,449
mechanical redstone torch and the idea
 

439
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:52,030
mechanical redstone torch and the idea
is you want to move it places and it and

440
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,040
is you want to move it places and it and
 

441
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,859
is you want to move it places and it and
the easiest way of moving it places is

442
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:54,869
the easiest way of moving it places is
 

443
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,689
the easiest way of moving it places is
to put it directly in front of a piston

444
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:56,699
to put it directly in front of a piston
 

445
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,960
to put it directly in front of a piston
so it's kind of hoping it would actually

446
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:58,970
so it's kind of hoping it would actually
 

447
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,879
so it's kind of hoping it would actually
work but it doesn't it moves a player

448
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:03,889
work but it doesn't it moves a player
 

449
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,340
work but it doesn't it moves a player
fat yeah you know what I think it is I

450
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,350
fat yeah you know what I think it is I
 

451
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,499
fat yeah you know what I think it is I
think when Pistons first came out this

452
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:09,509
think when Pistons first came out this
 

453
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,480
think when Pistons first came out this
is what I remember there was that glitch

454
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,490
is what I remember there was that glitch
 

455
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,280
is what I remember there was that glitch
where if you put a redstone torch in

456
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,290
where if you put a redstone torch in
 

457
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,139
where if you put a redstone torch in
front of it it would extend and crash

458
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:15,149
front of it it would extend and crash
 

459
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,179
front of it it would extend and crash
your game remember that that's like a

460
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:17,189
your game remember that that's like a
 

461
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:22,159
your game remember that that's like a
year ago and not fixed it so that well I

462
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,169
year ago and not fixed it so that well I
 

463
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,840
year ago and not fixed it so that well I
think the way he fixed is by making it

464
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:23,850
think the way he fixed is by making it
 

465
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,460
think the way he fixed is by making it
not

466
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,470
not
 

467
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,100
not
power the piston so maybe that's why

468
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,110
power the piston so maybe that's why
 

469
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,330
power the piston so maybe that's why
it's that way still maybe there's a

470
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,340
it's that way still maybe there's a
 

471
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,160
it's that way still maybe there's a
technical reason for it I don't know but

472
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,170
technical reason for it I don't know but
 

473
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,960
technical reason for it I don't know but
I hope they change it and it applies to

474
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:37,970
I hope they change it and it applies to
 

475
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:44,460
I hope they change it and it applies to
any any angle actually let's try ASCII

476
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,470

 

477
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,140

yes it doesn't get powered I think it'll

478
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,150
yes it doesn't get powered I think it'll
 

479
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,330
yes it doesn't get powered I think it'll
push it up eyes I thought I was going to

480
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:49,340
push it up eyes I thought I was going to
 

481
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,980
push it up eyes I thought I was going to
make a cool elevator or something though

482
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:50,990
make a cool elevator or something though
 

483
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,750
make a cool elevator or something though
oh well tada

484
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
oh well tada
 

485
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,400
oh well tada
and it has that too by the way if you

486
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,410
and it has that too by the way if you
 

487
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,850
and it has that too by the way if you
take the power away it powers the piston

488
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:00,860
take the power away it powers the piston
 

489
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,070
take the power away it powers the piston
then so that's kind of interesting very

490
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,080
then so that's kind of interesting very
 

491
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,020
then so that's kind of interesting very
cool nonetheless I'm sure while there's

492
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,030
cool nonetheless I'm sure while there's
 

493
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,030
cool nonetheless I'm sure while there's
already been a few cool things people

494
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,040
already been a few cool things people
 

495
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,980
already been a few cool things people
have made with it um the date nights but

496
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,990
have made with it um the date nights but
 

497
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,160
have made with it um the date nights but
the daylight Oh daylight sensor not

498
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,170
the daylight Oh daylight sensor not
 

499
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,830
the daylight Oh daylight sensor not
day/night sensor that's right because

500
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:20,840
day/night sensor that's right because
 

501
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,930
day/night sensor that's right because
it's only the text day although you can

502
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:22,940
it's only the text day although you can
 

503
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,580
it's only the text day although you can
invert the signal 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

redstone thing is a great addition to

510
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,170
redstone thing is a great addition to
 

511
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,590
redstone thing is a great addition to
the game I I kind of hope they go back

512
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:44,600
the game I I kind of hope they go back
 

513
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,240
the game I I kind of hope they go back
and change some of the older stuff too

514
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,250
and change some of the older stuff too
 

515
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,120
and change some of the older stuff too
like I think of glowstone lamps how cool

516
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,130
like I think of glowstone lamps how cool
 

517
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,820
like I think of glowstone lamps how cool
would it be if you could like have a

518
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:51,830
would it be if you could like have a
 

519
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,190
would it be if you could like have a
variable light adjustment to it like if

520
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,200
variable light adjustment to it like if
 

521
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,460
variable light adjustment to it like if
it's only sending power one block it

522
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,470
it's only sending power one block it
 

523
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,160
it's only sending power one block it
only gives off one one light if it's two

524
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,170
only gives off one one light if it's two
 

525
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,520
only gives off one one light if it's two
blocks away no no reverse reverse that

526
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:03,530
blocks away no no reverse reverse that
 

527
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,180
blocks away no no reverse reverse that
if it's extending all the way like fit

528
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,190
if it's extending all the way like fit
 

529
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,430
if it's extending all the way like fit
like 15 blocks and it's only light level

530
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
like 15 blocks and it's only light level
 

531
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,080
like 15 blocks and it's only light level
1 and 14 would be light level 2 13 would

532
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,090
1 and 14 would be light level 2 13 would
 

533
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,960
1 and 14 would be light level 2 13 would
be light level 3 kind of have adjustment

534
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:16,970
be light level 3 kind of have adjustment
 

535
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,120
be light level 3 kind of have adjustment
to that although we might want to block

536
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,130
to that although we might want to block
 

537
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,120
to that although we might want to block
for it entirely that was added or yeah

538
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,130
for it entirely that was added or yeah
 

539
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,910
for it entirely that was added or yeah
we got these weighted pressure plates I

540
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
we got these weighted pressure plates I
 

541
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,190
we got these weighted pressure plates I
haven't actually tried these the thing I

542
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,200
haven't actually tried these the thing I
 

543
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,330
haven't actually tried these the thing I
was mostly playing around with in

544
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,340
was mostly playing around with in
 

545
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,800
was mostly playing around with in
creative was the hopper I really want to

546
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:35,810
creative was the hopper I really want to
 

547
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,560
creative was the hopper I really want to
make an automatic broom stand

548
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,570
make an automatic broom stand
 

549
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,300
make an automatic broom stand
at some point so the more items we throw

550
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,310
at some point so the more items we throw
 

551
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,009
at some point so the more items we throw
on this the farther the signal is going

552
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,019
on this the farther the signal is going
 

553
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:52,379
on this the farther the signal is going
to go let's go on three four five six

554
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:52,389
to go let's go on three four five six
 

555
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,910
to go let's go on three four five six
seven eight

556
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
seven eight
 

557
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,620
seven eight
it goes pretty quick I think it's 57

558
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,630
it goes pretty quick I think it's 57
 

559
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,769
it goes pretty quick I think it's 57
items to get up the full power for the

560
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:01,779
items to get up the full power for the
 

561
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,530
items to get up the full power for the
gold one and then the can't remember

562
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:04,540
gold one and then the can't remember
 

563
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,620
gold one and then the can't remember
what the iron one was but it's like

564
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:06,630
what the iron one was but it's like
 

565
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,249
what the iron one was but it's like
several like I don't want to put a

566
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:11,259
several like I don't want to put a
 

567
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:12,569
several like I don't want to put a
number out because I'm going to be wrong

568
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:12,579
number out because I'm going to be wrong
 

569
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,699
number out because I'm going to be wrong
but I think it's around forty stacks of

570
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:14,709
but I think it's around forty stacks of
 

571
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,600
but I think it's around forty stacks of
stuff to get it full powered I know it's

572
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:18,610
stuff to get it full powered I know it's
 

573
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,550
stuff to get it full powered I know it's
more though

574
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:19,560
more though
 

575
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,680
more though
or or round there so I think if we throw

576
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:25,690
or or round there so I think if we throw
 

577
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,879
or or round there so I think if we throw
this full thing on it

578
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:26,889
this full thing on it
 

579
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,999
this full thing on it
I just let's just try one yeah one will

580
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:30,009
I just let's just try one yeah one will
 

581
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:34,800
I just let's just try one yeah one will
get it going what I throw there stack a

582
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:34,810
get it going what I throw there stack a
 

583
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:42,870
get it going what I throw there stack a
redstone makes it go to three pretty

584
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
redstone makes it go to three pretty
 

585
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,470
redstone makes it go to three pretty
cool only four items oh not players what

586
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
cool only four items oh not players what
 

587
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
cool only four items oh not players what
I kind of hope they do like we have the

588
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:49,209
I kind of hope they do like we have the
 

589
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,740
I kind of hope they do like we have the
stone pressure plates that detect

590
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:51,750
stone pressure plates that detect
 

591
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,269
stone pressure plates that detect
players and mobs and stuff I kind of

592
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:54,279
players and mobs and stuff I kind of
 

593
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,280
players and mobs and stuff I kind of
hope they apply this variable redstone

594
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,290
hope they apply this variable redstone
 

595
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,280
hope they apply this variable redstone
to it as well and maybe give each mob

596
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,290
to it as well and maybe give each mob
 

597
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,250
to it as well and maybe give each mob
its own special weight like like

598
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,260
its own special weight like like
 

599
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,860
its own special weight like like
chickens would be a light mob and cows

600
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:04,870
chickens would be a light mob and cows
 

601
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,710
chickens would be a light mob and cows
would be a heavy mob and we could use

602
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:07,720
would be a heavy mob and we could use
 

603
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,250
would be a heavy mob and we could use
that to detect mobs or like a baby cat

604
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:11,260
that to detect mobs or like a baby cat
 

605
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,669
that to detect mobs or like a baby cat
would be lighter than a an adult cow

606
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
would be lighter than a an adult cow
 

607
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,299
would be lighter than a an adult cow
that would be awesome

608
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:17,309

 

609
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,710

so yeah you can see it's it's nighttime

610
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
so yeah you can see it's it's nighttime
 

611
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
so yeah you can see it's it's nighttime
and this daylight sensor is not putting

612
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:25,449
and this daylight sensor is not putting
 

613
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,199
and this daylight sensor is not putting
out a signal at all throughout the whole

614
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:28,209
out a signal at all throughout the whole
 

615
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,700
out a signal at all throughout the whole
night it doesn't put out a signal it's

616
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:29,710
night it doesn't put out a signal it's
 

617
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,820
night it doesn't put out a signal it's
only like early sunrise to late sunset

618
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:31,830
only like early sunrise to late sunset
 

619
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,510
only like early sunrise to late sunset
that you'll get a signal from it oh is

620
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:36,520
that you'll get a signal from it oh is
 

621
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,920
that you'll get a signal from it oh is
this a creeper

622
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:38,930
this a creeper
 

623
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,900
this a creeper
speaking of that let's try this out I

624
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:40,910
speaking of that let's try this out I
 

625
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,820
speaking of that let's try this out I
want to I haven't actually tried it on

626
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:42,830
want to I haven't actually tried it on
 

627
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,170
want to I haven't actually tried it on
your ground and for what I wanted to

628
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,180
your ground and for what I wanted to
 

629
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,530
your ground and for what I wanted to
build today we'll be putting that under

630
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:50,540
build today we'll be putting that under
 

631
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,380
build today we'll be putting that under

632
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,390
ground all right so should might need a
 

633
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,130
ground all right so should might need a
direct line to this guy oh no yeah cuz

634
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,140
direct line to this guy oh no yeah cuz
 

635
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,640
direct line to this guy oh no yeah cuz
it's early early sun rise because we

636
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:03,650
it's early early sun rise because we
 

637
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,700
it's early early sun rise because we
just slept so it should get further and

638
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:06,710
just slept so it should get further and
 

639
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,340
just slept so it should get further and
further as the day goes on then midday

640
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,350
further as the day goes on then midday
 

641
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,930
further as the day goes on then midday
it's at full strength pretty sure the

642
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:16,940
it's at full strength pretty sure the
 

643
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,800
it's at full strength pretty sure the
two yet let's do it one alright anyway

644
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:23,810
two yet let's do it one alright anyway
 

645
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,920
two yet let's do it one alright anyway
moving on we have redstone comparator

646
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:28,930
moving on we have redstone comparator
 

647
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,660
moving on we have redstone comparator
compare that comparator I think I'm

648
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:31,670
compare that comparator I think I'm
 

649
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,120
compare that comparator I think I'm
saying that right another excellent

650
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,130
saying that right another excellent
 

651
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,500
saying that right another excellent
addition that adds there's a lot of

652
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,510
addition that adds there's a lot of
 

653
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,770
addition that adds there's a lot of
functionality to such a to a single

654
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:41,780
functionality to such a to a single
 

655
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,770
functionality to such a to a single
block which is what I like about what

656
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:44,780
block which is what I like about what
 

657
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,160
block which is what I like about what
words what Mojang does or what notch did

658
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,170
words what Mojang does or what notch did
 

659
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,800
words what Mojang does or what notch did
you know just takes simple concepts and

660
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:50,810
you know just takes simple concepts and
 

661
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,270
you know just takes simple concepts and
you can use them in so many different

662
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280
you can use them in so many different
 

663
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,410
you can use them in so many different
ways so this thing it will compare two

664
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:56,420
ways so this thing it will compare two
 

665
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,680
ways so this thing it will compare two
redstone signals the length of the

666
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,690
redstone signals the length of the
 

667
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,480
redstone signals the length of the
redstone so this is the main side here

668
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,490
redstone so this is the main side here
 

669
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,950
redstone so this is the main side here
so that a II as people call it if I puts

670
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:07,960
so that a II as people call it if I puts
 

671
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,360
so that a II as people call it if I puts
right it if there's no power coming from

672
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,370
right it if there's no power coming from
 

673
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,230
right it if there's no power coming from
the sides it will go right through if if

674
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
the sides it will go right through if if
 

675
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,660
the sides it will go right through if if
this same signal is stronger than this

676
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:19,670
this same signal is stronger than this
 

677
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,150
this same signal is stronger than this
one it will cut off the signal if we

678
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,160
one it will cut off the signal if we
 

679
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,200
one it will cut off the signal if we
have it even it goes right through and

680
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,210
have it even it goes right through and
 

681
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,890
have it even it goes right through and
if we have it further away it goes right

682
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:32,900
if we have it further away it goes right
 

683
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,680
if we have it further away it goes right
through so you only

684
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:38,690
through so you only
 

685
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,600
through so you only
again this is another thing I haven't

686
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,610
again this is another thing I haven't
 

687
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,160
again this is another thing I haven't
played around with too much okay sorry

688
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,170
played around with too much okay sorry
 

689
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,600
played around with too much okay sorry
about that I got a little distracted

690
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:46,610
about that I got a little distracted
 

691
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,060
about that I got a little distracted
trying some things with this and it it

692
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,070
trying some things with this and it it
 

693
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,890
trying some things with this and it it
led on to a few other things and a few

694
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:50,900
led on to a few other things and a few
 

695
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,490
led on to a few other things and a few
more things and oh man I am I am

696
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,500
more things and oh man I am I am
 

697
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,270
more things and oh man I am I am
fascinated with it that it is really

698
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,280
fascinated with it that it is really
 

699
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,850
fascinated with it that it is really
cool uh okay first of all it sort of

700
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:03,860
cool uh okay first of all it sort of
 

701
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,030
cool uh okay first of all it sort of
works as a repeater sort of not really

702
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,040

 

703
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,440

alright so that only extends its yeah

704
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,450
alright so that only extends its yeah
 

705
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,450
alright so that only extends its yeah
you I'm still learning here now this you

706
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:19,460
you I'm still learning here now this you
 

707
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,220
you I'm still learning here now this you
can see the signal goes up to here up to

708
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,230
can see the signal goes up to here up to
 

709
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,370
can see the signal goes up to here up to
that soil block if we add one let's just

710
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:24,380
that soil block if we add one let's just
 

711
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,450
that soil block if we add one let's just
hat add it halfway down extends it to

712
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:28,460
hat add it halfway down extends it to
 

713
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:37,110
hat add it halfway down extends it to
blocks and none other two blocks if we

714
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
blocks and none other two blocks if we
 

715
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,560
blocks and none other two blocks if we
see here

716
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,570
see here
 

717
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,130
see here
OOP if we move it all the way back by

the torch does it go further I can't

720
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
the torch does it go further I can't
 

721
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,260
the torch does it go further I can't
remember now all right still only two

722
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,270
remember now all right still only two
 

723
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,750
remember now all right still only two
blocks and a two-box every time okay

724
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
blocks and a two-box every time okay
 

725
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,670
blocks and a two-box every time okay
this thing it has a little bit of a

726
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:00,680
this thing it has a little bit of a
 

727
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,570
this thing it has a little bit of a
delay to it as well it's very very short

728
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:04,580
delay to it as well it's very very short
 

729
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,530
delay to it as well it's very very short
though all right

730
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:08,540
though all right
 

731
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,390
though all right
but we can kind of use it as a repeater

732
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
but we can kind of use it as a repeater
 

733
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,460
but we can kind of use it as a repeater
like that like it's fast

734
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,470

 

735
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,100

can't tell if that's a visual it's

736
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,110
can't tell if that's a visual it's
 

737
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,460
can't tell if that's a visual it's
visually updating or if it's actually

738
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:26,470
visually updating or if it's actually
 

739
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,770
visually updating or if it's actually
pretty close to instant I can't can't

740
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:29,780
pretty close to instant I can't can't
 

741
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,740
pretty close to instant I can't can't
really tell maybe let's put torch at the

742
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:32,750
really tell maybe let's put torch at the
 

743
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,370
really tell maybe let's put torch at the
end here I like I don't want to use my

744
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:39,380
end here I like I don't want to use my
 

745
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,710
end here I like I don't want to use my
inventory at all anymore I hate it so

746
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:41,720
inventory at all anymore I hate it so
 

747
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,700
inventory at all anymore I hate it so
much it's so hard to do anything with

748
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,710
much it's so hard to do anything with
 

749
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,320
much it's so hard to do anything with
the being all glitched out alright yeah

750
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,330
the being all glitched out alright yeah
 

751
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,290
the being all glitched out alright yeah
there's a delay to it that's what I

752
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:56,300
there's a delay to it that's what I
 

753
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,710
there's a delay to it that's what I
thought I dad's doing some weird stuff

754
00:21:59,710 --> 00:21:59,720
thought I dad's doing some weird stuff
 

755
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,210
thought I dad's doing some weird stuff
with it if you do you do this like that

756
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,220
with it if you do you do this like that
 

757
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,990
with it if you do you do this like that
you put a torch down stays powered right

758
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,000
you put a torch down stays powered right
 

759
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,490
you put a torch down stays powered right
kind of like a repeater does if you

760
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:12,500
kind of like a repeater does if you
 

761
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
kind of like a repeater does if you
remove the torch you can see them slowly

762
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,510
remove the torch you can see them slowly
 

763
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,310
remove the torch you can see them slowly
fades out really neat if you extend it a

764
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,320
fades out really neat if you extend it a
 

765
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,250
fades out really neat if you extend it a
little bit further though seems that too

766
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,260
little bit further though seems that too
 

767
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,310
little bit further though seems that too
far it'll start pulsing like this that's

768
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
far it'll start pulsing like this that's
 

769
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,170
far it'll start pulsing like this that's
that's really cool if we put repeaters

770
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,180
that's really cool if we put repeaters
 

771
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,670
that's really cool if we put repeaters
around it we can see that a little

772
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:36,680
around it we can see that a little
 

773
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,840
around it we can see that a little
better not all of them just just the

774
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:40,850
better not all of them just just the
 

775
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,250
better not all of them just just the
ones over here these two actually pulse

776
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,260
ones over here these two actually pulse
 

777
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,880
ones over here these two actually pulse
these ones stay stay on all the time

778
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:50,890

 

779
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,380

wondering if you can use it like as a to

780
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,390
wondering if you can use it like as a to
 

781
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,450
wondering if you can use it like as a to
wave or Peter it's not really meant to

782
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:58,460
wave or Peter it's not really meant to
 

783
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,720
wave or Peter it's not really meant to
be a repeater though oh yeah also you

784
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:01,730
be a repeater though oh yeah also you
 

785
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,200
be a repeater though oh yeah also you
can use it as a clock let's let's set

786
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,210
can use it as a clock let's let's set
 

787
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,040
can use it as a clock let's let's set
that up I'm wondering how it compares to

788
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,050
that up I'm wondering how it compares to
 

789
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,720
that up I'm wondering how it compares to
a redstone clock if you make it go

790
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:10,730
a redstone clock if you make it go
 

791
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:23,720
a redstone clock if you make it go
faster stay bleah alright do this

792
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:23,730

 

793
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,900

very neat if we shorten it I don't think

794
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,910
very neat if we shorten it I don't think
 

795
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,450
very neat if we shorten it I don't think
it works that's too fast I'm using a

796
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,460
it works that's too fast I'm using a
 

797
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,470
it works that's too fast I'm using a
torch so what else what else so there's

798
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
torch so what else what else so there's
 

799
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,380
torch so what else what else so there's
a negative thing too as well if you

800
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,390
a negative thing too as well if you
 

801
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,960
a negative thing too as well if you
right-click it that light turns on it

802
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:45,970
right-click it that light turns on it
 

803
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,280
right-click it that light turns on it
like does a subtraction apparently two

804
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,290
like does a subtraction apparently two
 

805
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:59,760
like does a subtraction apparently two
three four so this is it three we're

806
00:23:59,760 --> 00:23:59,770
three four so this is it three we're
 

807
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,110
three four so this is it three we're
going to have a hard time demonstrating

808
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
going to have a hard time demonstrating
 

809
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,720
going to have a hard time demonstrating
this because I don't know exactly know

810
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,730
this because I don't know exactly know
 

811
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,620
this because I don't know exactly know
what I'm doing

812
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,630
what I'm doing
 

813
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:11,420
what I'm doing
I think be yeah the other side has to be

814
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:11,430
I think be yeah the other side has to be
 

815
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:16,620
I think be yeah the other side has to be
further out is it oh well that pulsed

816
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:16,630
further out is it oh well that pulsed
 

817
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,620
further out is it oh well that pulsed
you see that mmm

818
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:21,630
you see that mmm
 

819
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,650
you see that mmm
that's a monostable circuit right there

820
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:24,660
that's a monostable circuit right there
 

821
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,810
that's a monostable circuit right there
that's what I see that's a very simple

822
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:27,820
that's what I see that's a very simple
 

823
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,030
that's what I see that's a very simple
monostable circuit if you just want a

824
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,040
monostable circuit if you just want a
 

825
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,570
monostable circuit if you just want a
quick pulse yep

826
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:35,580
quick pulse yep
 

827
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,220
quick pulse yep
that's kind of cool but you can turn

828
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,230
that's kind of cool but you can turn
 

829
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,400
that's kind of cool but you can turn
that into T flip-flop and all kinds of

830
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,410
that into T flip-flop and all kinds of
 

831
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,320
that into T flip-flop and all kinds of
crazy things let's use a real piss a

832
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,330
crazy things let's use a real piss a
 

833
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:55,820
crazy things let's use a real piss a
sticky piston here learning as I go I

834
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:55,830

 

835
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,430

should probably just cut this up I'm I'm

836
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
should probably just cut this up I'm I'm
 

837
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,170
should probably just cut this up I'm I'm
not very focused at the moment I'm just

838
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,180
not very focused at the moment I'm just
 

839
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,440
not very focused at the moment I'm just
trying to random stuff okay what was I

840
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,450
trying to random stuff okay what was I
 

841
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:15,990
trying to random stuff okay what was I
doing just this yep hmm yeah here's a

842
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
doing just this yep hmm yeah here's a
 

843
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,060
doing just this yep hmm yeah here's a
pretty simple T flip-flop you can make

844
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,070
pretty simple T flip-flop you can make
 

845
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,520
pretty simple T flip-flop you can make
with it piston one if you use a redstone

846
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,530
with it piston one if you use a redstone
 

847
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:27,670
with it piston one if you use a redstone
block I have this on the subtraction off

848
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:27,680

 

849
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,550

on off on and it's sort of adjustable

850
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:33,560
on off on and it's sort of adjustable
 

851
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,920
on off on and it's sort of adjustable
like if you decided I don't want it to

852
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:35,930
like if you decided I don't want it to
 

853
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,260
like if you decided I don't want it to
be a T flip-flop anymore turn that off

854
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,270
be a T flip-flop anymore turn that off
 

855
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,990
be a T flip-flop anymore turn that off
and it's not or another thing you can do

856
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
and it's not or another thing you can do
 

857
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,650
and it's not or another thing you can do
is just change that and now it's not a D

858
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:47,660
is just change that and now it's not a D
 

859
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,370
is just change that and now it's not a D
flip-flop that's kind of cool

860
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:53,380

 

861
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,390

okay it looks like there is a way of

862
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,400
okay it looks like there is a way of
 

863
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,070
okay it looks like there is a way of
making a stable clock out of this that

864
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,080
making a stable clock out of this that
 

865
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,340
making a stable clock out of this that
is SuperDuper fast if you if you put

866
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,350
is SuperDuper fast if you if you put
 

867
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,200
is SuperDuper fast if you if you put
these on subtraction and do a loop like

868
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,210
these on subtraction and do a loop like
 

869
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,390
these on subtraction and do a loop like
this what so as long as getting power

870
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:07,400
this what so as long as getting power
 

871
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,550
this what so as long as getting power
it'll pulse like that it's very very

872
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:12,560
it'll pulse like that it's very very
 

873
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,970
it'll pulse like that it's very very
fast does cause a lot of lag though so

874
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:15,980
fast does cause a lot of lag though so
 

875
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,270
fast does cause a lot of lag though so
it's not really good thing also there's

876
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,280
it's not really good thing also there's
 

877
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,510
it's not really good thing also there's
another cool thing you can do with these

878
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
another cool thing you can do with these
 

879
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,930
another cool thing you can do with these
using dispensers if you just took up a

880
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:25,940
using dispensers if you just took up a
 

881
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,160
using dispensers if you just took up a
dispenser too it's put items in power

882
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,170
dispenser too it's put items in power
 

883
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,110
dispenser too it's put items in power
it's shoots it out extremely quickly as

884
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
it's shoots it out extremely quickly as
 

885
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,920
it's shoots it out extremely quickly as
quick as possible that's really cool I

886
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:40,930
quick as possible that's really cool I
 

887
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,350
quick as possible that's really cool I
think in this patch also they fixed the

888
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,360
think in this patch also they fixed the
 

889
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,940
think in this patch also they fixed the
dispenser bug which is I'm kind of sad

890
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:48,950
dispenser bug which is I'm kind of sad
 

891
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,460
dispenser bug which is I'm kind of sad
about it to be honest oh maybe not okay

892
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,470
about it to be honest oh maybe not okay
 

893
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,010
about it to be honest oh maybe not okay
sweet they did yeah I was worried they

894
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,020
sweet they did yeah I was worried they
 

895
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:06,300
sweet they did yeah I was worried they
did I thought I read they did whoo sweet

896
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,310
did I thought I read they did whoo sweet
 

897
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,650
did I thought I read they did whoo sweet
that means my firework show should still

898
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:08,660
that means my firework show should still
 

899
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,270
that means my firework show should still
work on the minecraft server all right

900
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:13,280
work on the minecraft server all right
 

901
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,920
work on the minecraft server all right
guys I came up with a pretty fun way of

902
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:14,930
guys I came up with a pretty fun way of
 

903
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,900
guys I came up with a pretty fun way of
doing an RS nor latch here as well just

904
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:16,910
doing an RS nor latch here as well just
 

905
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,150
doing an RS nor latch here as well just
two sticky pistons and two redstone

906
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,160
two sticky pistons and two redstone
 

907
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,130
two sticky pistons and two redstone
blocks if you press it nothing happens

908
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,140
blocks if you press it nothing happens
 

909
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,690
blocks if you press it nothing happens
if I go to this one switches does it

910
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:28,700
if I go to this one switches does it
 

911
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,310
if I go to this one switches does it
matter how many times I press it doesn't

912
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
matter how many times I press it doesn't
 

913
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,340
matter how many times I press it doesn't
switch again

914
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,350

 

915
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,259

uh-huh whoops

916
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:39,269
uh-huh whoops
 

917
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,399
uh-huh whoops
oh man is crazy this piston he wanted

918
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:43,409
oh man is crazy this piston he wanted
 

919
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,259
oh man is crazy this piston he wanted
this redstone block right but when he

920
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:45,269
this redstone block right but when he
 

921
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,029
this redstone block right but when he
went forth this guy he wanted it too and

922
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
went forth this guy he wanted it too and
 

923
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,259
went forth this guy he wanted it too and
they both reach for it at the same time

924
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:48,269
they both reach for it at the same time
 

925
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,419
they both reach for it at the same time
and and they're their best friends and

926
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:50,429
and and they're their best friends and
 

927
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,749
and and they're their best friends and
they can't decide who gets it so nobody

928
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:53,759
they can't decide who gets it so nobody
 

929
00:27:53,759 --> 00:28:01,960
they can't decide who gets it so nobody
gets it uh-oh now we've really done it

930
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:01,970

 

931
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,259

mm-hmm yep there's your problem

932
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:08,269

 

933
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:13,570

nobody

934
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:13,580

 

935
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,180

I don't usually gets motion sickness

936
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,190
I don't usually gets motion sickness
 

937
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:24,940
I don't usually gets motion sickness
guys but even I have my limits and then

938
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:24,950
guys but even I have my limits and then
 

939
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,350
guys but even I have my limits and then
the three businesses they start to play

940
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,360
the three businesses they start to play
 

941
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,030
the three businesses they start to play
a game of keep-away the guy in the

942
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,040
a game of keep-away the guy in the
 

943
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,160
a game of keep-away the guy in the
middle he got the redstone block and the

944
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,170
middle he got the redstone block and the
 

945
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,480
middle he got the redstone block and the
guy on the Left he's like give it to me

946
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,490
guy on the Left he's like give it to me
 

947
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,370
guy on the Left he's like give it to me
give it to me and he puts his arms up to

948
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:33,380
