hello welcome back everybody do you know

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:12,630
hello welcome back everybody do you know
 

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,090
hello welcome back everybody do you know
what time it is do you because I don't

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,100
what time it is do you because I don't
 

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,230
what time it is do you because I don't
know that's why I keep a clock on the

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
know that's why I keep a clock on the
 

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,810
know that's why I keep a clock on the
wall it is

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:20,820
wall it is
 

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,939
wall it is
oh it's evil time darn it I shoulda

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:22,949
oh it's evil time darn it I shoulda
 

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,210
oh it's evil time darn it I shoulda
known that so guys last episode we

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,220
known that so guys last episode we
 

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,400
known that so guys last episode we
worked on the Nexus storage room here a

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,410
worked on the Nexus storage room here a
 

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,830
worked on the Nexus storage room here a
little bit and I enjoyed it quite a bit

16
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
little bit and I enjoyed it quite a bit
 

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,880
little bit and I enjoyed it quite a bit
we got a lot done we got the automatic

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:37,890
we got a lot done we got the automatic
 

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,220
we got a lot done we got the automatic
sorting and storage working on it and I

20
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,230
sorting and storage working on it and I
 

21
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,569
sorting and storage working on it and I
think we're going to continue it again

22
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:41,579
think we're going to continue it again
 

23
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,020
think we're going to continue it again
today um so here's what I want to do

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,030
today um so here's what I want to do
 

25
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,150
today um so here's what I want to do
we're going to focus on making this

26
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
we're going to focus on making this
 

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,639
we're going to focus on making this
thing more practical today and looking

28
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:49,649
thing more practical today and looking
 

29
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,880
thing more practical today and looking
at you know ways of making it actually

30
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:52,890
at you know ways of making it actually
 

31
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,479
at you know ways of making it actually
convenient because if it takes us 30

32
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:56,489
convenient because if it takes us 30
 

33
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,700
convenient because if it takes us 30
seconds to a minute to request an item

34
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,710
seconds to a minute to request an item
 

35
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,099
seconds to a minute to request an item
out of this thing we're not going to use

36
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:01,109
out of this thing we're not going to use
 

37
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,569
out of this thing we're not going to use
it very much honestly so we're going to

38
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:02,579
it very much honestly so we're going to
 

39
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,539
it very much honestly so we're going to
look at a couple ideas on how we might

40
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:05,549
look at a couple ideas on how we might
 

41
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,770
look at a couple ideas on how we might
be able to get it down to like five

42
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:06,780
be able to get it down to like five
 

43
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,399
be able to get it down to like five
seconds like to enter the code and

44
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:09,409
seconds like to enter the code and
 

45
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,320
seconds like to enter the code and
request item if we can do that in five

46
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,330
request item if we can do that in five
 

47
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,730
request item if we can do that in five
seconds this would be amazing not only

48
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:16,740
seconds this would be amazing not only
 

49
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,719
seconds this would be amazing not only
would it be an awesome science

50
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:17,729
would it be an awesome science
 

51
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,390
would it be an awesome science
experiment but it'll actually work

52
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:19,400
experiment but it'll actually work
 

53
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,670
experiment but it'll actually work
uh-huh all right everybody so I just

54
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
uh-huh all right everybody so I just
 

55
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,289
uh-huh all right everybody so I just
stopped into a creative world there for

56
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,299
stopped into a creative world there for
 

57
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,700
stopped into a creative world there for
a second to experiment with some

58
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:28,710
a second to experiment with some
 

59
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,910
a second to experiment with some
building styles for the control panel

60
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
building styles for the control panel
 

61
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,560
building styles for the control panel
the terminal whatever we're calling it

62
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,570
the terminal whatever we're calling it
 

63
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,140
the terminal whatever we're calling it
the thing that you enter the code to

64
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,150
the thing that you enter the code to
 

65
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,330
the thing that you enter the code to
request an item with and I came up with

66
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,340
request an item with and I came up with
 

67
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,560
request an item with and I came up with
something I like so we're going to build

68
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,570
something I like so we're going to build
 

69
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,590
something I like so we're going to build
it together here first this is the very

70
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
it together here first this is the very
 

71
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,109
it together here first this is the very
center of the Nexus right here this this

72
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
center of the Nexus right here this this
 

73
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,660
center of the Nexus right here this this
line so let's maybe go a few blocks back

74
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:47,670
line so let's maybe go a few blocks back
 

75
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,620
line so let's maybe go a few blocks back
here save some room for some redstone

76
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:50,630
here save some room for some redstone
 

77
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,030
here save some room for some redstone
because we got to connect all the the

78
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
because we got to connect all the the
 

79
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,550
because we got to connect all the the
rows together still and I haven't done

80
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
rows together still and I haven't done
 

81
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,660
rows together still and I haven't done
that yet maybe this is far enough away I

82
00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,670
that yet maybe this is far enough away I
 

83
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,130
that yet maybe this is far enough away I
hope don't want to go too too far yeah

84
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
hope don't want to go too too far yeah
 

85
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,440
hope don't want to go too too far yeah
let's start here okay so this is what I

86
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
let's start here okay so this is what I
 

87
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,020
let's start here okay so this is what I
decide to do guys we're building this

88
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,030
decide to do guys we're building this
 

89
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,449
decide to do guys we're building this
just so we can visualize it Toofer

90
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:11,459
just so we can visualize it Toofer
 

91
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,380
just so we can visualize it Toofer
for later today for the ideas we are

92
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,390
for later today for the ideas we are
 

93
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,369
for later today for the ideas we are
going to do the 8 lever thing this was

94
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:19,379
going to do the 8 lever thing this was
 

95
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,929
going to do the 8 lever thing this was
something that was discussed and I want

96
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:20,939
something that was discussed and I want
 

97
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,240
something that was discussed and I want
to address some of the concerns with

98
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,250
to address some of the concerns with
 

99
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,440
to address some of the concerns with
this ok so what we're doing to request

100
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,450
this ok so what we're doing to request
 

101
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,140
this ok so what we're doing to request
an item we're going to have 8 levers on

102
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
an item we're going to have 8 levers on
 

103
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,330
an item we're going to have 8 levers on
this thing let's get them going here and

104
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,340
this thing let's get them going here and
 

105
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,280
this thing let's get them going here and
different combinations of this will

106
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,290
different combinations of this will
 

107
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,640
different combinations of this will
request different items basically you go

108
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:40,650
request different items basically you go
 

109
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,589
request different items basically you go
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times

110
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times
 

111
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,069
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times
2 times 2 times 2 you get 256 different

112
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:46,079
2 times 2 times 2 you get 256 different
 

113
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,379
2 times 2 times 2 you get 256 different
possibilities and there's 256 different

114
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:48,389
possibilities and there's 256 different
 

115
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,449
possibilities and there's 256 different
items in the nexus so it works out

116
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:50,459
items in the nexus so it works out
 

117
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,110
items in the nexus so it works out
perfectly depending on the different

118
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
perfectly depending on the different
 

119
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,929
perfectly depending on the different
combination they'll get a different item

120
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:55,939
combination they'll get a different item
 

121
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,699
combination they'll get a different item
now this was discussed and you guys

122
00:02:58,699 --> 00:02:58,709
now this was discussed and you guys
 

123
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,429
now this was discussed and you guys
suggested maybe we should do a different

124
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:01,439
suggested maybe we should do a different
 

125
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,089
suggested maybe we should do a different
type of inputs because this isn't super

126
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:05,099
type of inputs because this isn't super
 

127
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,500
type of inputs because this isn't super
convenient right we have 8 different

128
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,510
convenient right we have 8 different
 

129
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,690
convenient right we have 8 different
inputs we could condense it down to 3 if

130
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:11,700
inputs we could condense it down to 3 if
 

131
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,699
inputs we could condense it down to 3 if
we did an item frame system we're not

132
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:16,709
we did an item frame system we're not
 

133
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,080
we did an item frame system we're not
doing this by the way I just want to

134
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,090
doing this by the way I just want to
 

135
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,369
doing this by the way I just want to
bring it up because you guys mentioned

136
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:19,379
bring it up because you guys mentioned
 

137
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,129
bring it up because you guys mentioned
it you could have like you know items in

138
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:25,139
it you could have like you know items in
 

139
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,589
it you could have like you know items in
these and depending on how you rotate it

140
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
these and depending on how you rotate it
 

141
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,689
these and depending on how you rotate it
you can get eight different outcomes so

142
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:29,699
you can get eight different outcomes so
 

143
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,159
you can get eight different outcomes so
if you go eight times eight times eight

144
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,169
if you go eight times eight times eight
 

145
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,879
if you go eight times eight times eight
I think it's 512 so we could reduce it

146
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:34,889
I think it's 512 so we could reduce it
 

147
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,689
I think it's 512 so we could reduce it
from 8 inputs down to 3 that should make

148
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:38,699
from 8 inputs down to 3 that should make
 

149
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,300
from 8 inputs down to 3 that should make
it better right well I don't think it is

150
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,310
it better right well I don't think it is
 

151
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,249
it better right well I don't think it is
actually I think there's two main

152
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:43,259
actually I think there's two main
 

153
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,240
actually I think there's two main
problems with doing that um maybe

154
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,250
problems with doing that um maybe
 

155
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,659
problems with doing that um maybe
shouldn't have torn it down already it

156
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:50,669
shouldn't have torn it down already it
 

157
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,580
shouldn't have torn it down already it
seems like it might be more convenient

158
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,590
seems like it might be more convenient
 

159
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,979
seems like it might be more convenient
let's actually select what you want you

160
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:54,989
let's actually select what you want you
 

161
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,140
let's actually select what you want you
have to you have to rotate this up to

162
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
have to you have to rotate this up to
 

163
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,569
have to you have to rotate this up to
eight times well with this you just

164
00:03:59,569 --> 00:03:59,579
eight times well with this you just
 

165
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,309
eight times well with this you just
quickly right-click it and you're done

166
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:01,319
quickly right-click it and you're done
 

167
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,170
quickly right-click it and you're done
you know I can switch probably three or

168
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,180
you know I can switch probably three or
 

169
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,789
you know I can switch probably three or
four levers by the time I do a full

170
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:07,799
four levers by the time I do a full
 

171
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,099
four levers by the time I do a full
rotation with one of these the other

172
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:10,109
rotation with one of these the other
 

173
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,960
rotation with one of these the other
thing though is to actually represent

174
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:11,970
thing though is to actually represent
 

175
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,409
thing though is to actually represent
what this is at is a little bit

176
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:15,419
what this is at is a little bit
 

177
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,029
what this is at is a little bit
difficult this is basically on or off

178
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,039
difficult this is basically on or off
 

179
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,250
difficult this is basically on or off
yes or no black or whites you know this

180
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,260
yes or no black or whites you know this
 

181
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,930
yes or no black or whites you know this
you would have to maybe use a number

182
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:23,940
you would have to maybe use a number
 

183
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,740
you would have to maybe use a number
between one and

184
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:24,750
between one and
 

185
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,710
between one and
eight and it's an analogue sort of thing

186
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
eight and it's an analogue sort of thing
 

187
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,050
eight and it's an analogue sort of thing
that doesn't actually have a good way of

188
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,060
that doesn't actually have a good way of
 

189
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,380
that doesn't actually have a good way of
representing what it's on right now so

190
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,390
representing what it's on right now so
 

191
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,690
representing what it's on right now so
all in all I don't think that's a good

192
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:35,700
all in all I don't think that's a good
 

193
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
all in all I don't think that's a good
idea

194
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:37,910

 

195
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,370

because we got to store the codes and be

196
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,380
because we got to store the codes and be
 

197
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,900
because we got to store the codes and be
able to reference them somewhere and

198
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:41,910
able to reference them somewhere and
 

199
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,330
able to reference them somewhere and
it's going to be easy to convert in our

200
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,340
it's going to be easy to convert in our
 

201
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,970
it's going to be easy to convert in our
heads and this is basically the easiest

202
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:46,980
heads and this is basically the easiest
 

203
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,410
heads and this is basically the easiest
thing I think but let's go ahead and

204
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:51,420
thing I think but let's go ahead and
 

205
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,300
thing I think but let's go ahead and
finish up what we're going to do here I

206
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,310
finish up what we're going to do here I
 

207
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,550
finish up what we're going to do here I
got to get into the habit of building

208
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
got to get into the habit of building
 

209
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,980
got to get into the habit of building
and talking at the same time a little

210
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:57,990
and talking at the same time a little
 

211
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,830
and talking at the same time a little
bit more thank you for all the responses

212
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
bit more thank you for all the responses
 

213
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,720
bit more thank you for all the responses
on the last episode guys it sounds like

214
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,730
on the last episode guys it sounds like
 

215
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,900
on the last episode guys it sounds like
what we should do like I talked about

216
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:07,910
what we should do like I talked about
 

217
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,420
what we should do like I talked about
spending too much time on stuff and the

218
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:11,430
spending too much time on stuff and the
 

219
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,180
spending too much time on stuff and the
consensus I seem to see in the comments

220
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,190
consensus I seem to see in the comments
 

221
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,110
consensus I seem to see in the comments
was that we should maybe do more stuff

222
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,120
was that we should maybe do more stuff
 

223
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,820
was that we should maybe do more stuff
on camera like build on camera a little

224
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:19,830
on camera like build on camera a little
 

225
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,860
on camera like build on camera a little
bit more and that kind of thing if I

226
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:21,870
bit more and that kind of thing if I
 

227
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,850
bit more and that kind of thing if I
could build and talk at the same time I

228
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:24,860
could build and talk at the same time I
 

229
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,490
could build and talk at the same time I
would be so happy I struggle though you

230
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:28,500
would be so happy I struggle though you
 

231
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,320
would be so happy I struggle though you
know you might notice sometimes I'll be

232
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,330
know you might notice sometimes I'll be
 

233
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,430
know you might notice sometimes I'll be
building and then I'll get into

234
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
building and then I'll get into
 

235
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,110
building and then I'll get into
explaining something and I just totally

236
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
explaining something and I just totally
 

237
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,870
explaining something and I just totally
stop building like I can't do both at

238
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
stop building like I can't do both at
 

239
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,400
stop building like I can't do both at
once here let's explain something else

240
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,410
once here let's explain something else
 

241
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,960
once here let's explain something else
here so I'm going to have a lever in the

242
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:41,970
here so I'm going to have a lever in the
 

243
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,860
here so I'm going to have a lever in the
middle and this is going to be like an

244
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:45,870
middle and this is going to be like an
 

245
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,070
middle and this is going to be like an
easy switch for this whole thing this is

246
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,080
easy switch for this whole thing this is
 

247
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,050
easy switch for this whole thing this is
going to activate the clock that will

248
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
going to activate the clock that will
 

249
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,159
going to activate the clock that will
start pulsing and requesting items from

250
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,169
start pulsing and requesting items from
 

251
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,409
start pulsing and requesting items from
there so every time the clock goes it's

252
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:57,419
there so every time the clock goes it's
 

253
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,570
there so every time the clock goes it's
going to request one item basically and

254
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,580
going to request one item basically and
 

255
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,540
going to request one item basically and
then when we're done we flip it back up

256
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,550
then when we're done we flip it back up
 

257
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,680
then when we're done we flip it back up
and then it stops but we're also going

258
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:06,690
and then it stops but we're also going
 

259
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,420
and then it stops but we're also going
to have buttons around here that will

260
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,430
to have buttons around here that will
 

261
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,240
to have buttons around here that will
request specific numbers of items like

262
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,250
request specific numbers of items like
 

263
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,969
request specific numbers of items like
if we want a full stack exactly 64 or

264
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:13,979
if we want a full stack exactly 64 or
 

265
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,340
if we want a full stack exactly 64 or
something I want to set up to do that

266
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,350
something I want to set up to do that
 

267
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,860
something I want to set up to do that
too and this will just be like an easy

268
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:18,870
too and this will just be like an easy
 

269
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,190
too and this will just be like an easy
on off you know longer it stays on the

270
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,200
on off you know longer it stays on the
 

271
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,740
on off you know longer it stays on the
more items we get from the thing I think

272
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:24,750
more items we get from the thing I think
 

273
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,390
more items we get from the thing I think
is a good way of doing it and I'll

274
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
is a good way of doing it and I'll
 

275
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,100
is a good way of doing it and I'll
probably use this the most just because

276
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,110
probably use this the most just because
 

277
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,310
probably use this the most just because
it's nice and convenient alright so I

278
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,320
it's nice and convenient alright so I
 

279
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,300
it's nice and convenient alright so I
did that wrong

280
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,310
did that wrong
 

281
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,920
did that wrong
I think I had stairs here and terrible

282
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:42,930
I think I had stairs here and terrible
 

283
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,460
I think I had stairs here and terrible
oh I missed okay yes

284
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,470
oh I missed okay yes
 

285
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,100
oh I missed okay yes
and then slabs on top all right and this

286
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,110
and then slabs on top all right and this
 

287
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,650
and then slabs on top all right and this
looked pretty cool when I did it before

288
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:51,660
looked pretty cool when I did it before
 

289
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,160
looked pretty cool when I did it before
I think let's clear a little bit of land

290
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,170
I think let's clear a little bit of land
 

291
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:01,550
I think let's clear a little bit of land
here I want to get some slabs some slabs

292
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
here I want to get some slabs some slabs
 

293
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,410
here I want to get some slabs some slabs
I don't know why I said it like that and

294
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:03,420
I don't know why I said it like that and
 

295
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,170
I don't know why I said it like that and
just do like a pattern like this on both

296
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,180
just do like a pattern like this on both
 

297
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,110
just do like a pattern like this on both
sides and I am unfortunately out when I

298
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
sides and I am unfortunately out when I
 

299
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
sides and I am unfortunately out when I
did it before I put courts behind the

300
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,490
did it before I put courts behind the
 

301
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,320
did it before I put courts behind the
glass here let's try it let's try do it

302
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,330
glass here let's try it let's try do it
 

303
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,730
glass here let's try it let's try do it
with the courts and let's try do it with

304
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740
with the courts and let's try do it with
 

305
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,830
with the courts and let's try do it with
some sea lanterns I brought those that

306
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
some sea lanterns I brought those that
 

307
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,390
some sea lanterns I brought those that
might be better then we can get some

308
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
might be better then we can get some
 

309
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,950
might be better then we can get some
actual light from this too which would

310
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:27,960
actual light from this too which would
 

311
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:38,380
actual light from this too which would
be good let's see what we like more okay

312
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,390

 

313
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,240

hmm I'm not sure what do you guys like

314
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,250
hmm I'm not sure what do you guys like
 

315
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,830
hmm I'm not sure what do you guys like
more the sea lanterns or the courts I

316
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
more the sea lanterns or the courts I
 

317
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,330
more the sea lanterns or the courts I
almost like the courts more just because

318
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340
almost like the courts more just because
 

319
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,070
almost like the courts more just because
it's cleaner okay everybody so this is a

320
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
it's cleaner okay everybody so this is a
 

321
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,050
it's cleaner okay everybody so this is a
look I decide to go with I hope you guys

322
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,060
look I decide to go with I hope you guys
 

323
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,370
look I decide to go with I hope you guys
like it

324
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,380
like it
 

325
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,170
like it
we'll go with a different floor though I

326
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,180
we'll go with a different floor though I
 

327
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,300
we'll go with a different floor though I
just put this here because it's better

328
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,310
just put this here because it's better
 

329
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,060
just put this here because it's better
than grass right for right now I hope

330
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,070
than grass right for right now I hope
 

331
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,800
than grass right for right now I hope
now let's talk about what I wanted to

332
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:06,810
now let's talk about what I wanted to
 

333
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,090
now let's talk about what I wanted to
talk about okay so we need a bunch of

334
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,100
talk about okay so we need a bunch of
 

335
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,130
talk about okay so we need a bunch of
codes like a code for each of the items

336
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,140
codes like a code for each of the items
 

337
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,370
codes like a code for each of the items
we need like the item identifier in the

338
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,380
we need like the item identifier in the
 

339
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,410
we need like the item identifier in the
code after it so originally I was

340
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:18,420
code after it so originally I was
 

341
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,960
code after it so originally I was
thinking about using a book we could do

342
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:20,970
thinking about using a book we could do
 

343
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,700
thinking about using a book we could do
something like this for example where we

344
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,710
something like this for example where we
 

345
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,120
something like this for example where we
have the code and then the item name

346
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,130
have the code and then the item name
 

347
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,430
have the code and then the item name
right so if we wanted to get steak from

348
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
right so if we wanted to get steak from
 

349
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:36,460
right so if we wanted to get steak from
the system its 0 1 0 0

350
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:36,470
the system its 0 1 0 0
 

351
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,010
the system its 0 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 all right so already you

352
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,020
1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 all right so already you
 

353
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,570
1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 all right so already you
can tell there's a little bit of a

354
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,580
can tell there's a little bit of a
 

355
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,210
can tell there's a little bit of a
problem there I have a short memory

356
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,220
problem there I have a short memory
 

357
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,340
problem there I have a short memory
uh-huh and then what we do just flip

358
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,350
uh-huh and then what we do just flip
 

359
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,190
uh-huh and then what we do just flip
this down we could get steak and then

360
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
this down we could get steak and then
 

361
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,650
this down we could get steak and then
flip it back up and when it's done or we

362
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:53,660
flip it back up and when it's done or we
 

363
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,270
flip it back up and when it's done or we
could hit a button either at the top

364
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,280
could hit a button either at the top
 

365
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,820
could hit a button either at the top
left or top right like if we want a

366
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:57,830
left or top right like if we want a
 

367
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,740
left or top right like if we want a
stack of steak they'll probably be a

368
00:08:59,740 --> 00:08:59,750
stack of steak they'll probably be a
 

369
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,650
stack of steak they'll probably be a
button for that you just hit that and

370
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:01,660
button for that you just hit that and
 

371
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,410
button for that you just hit that and
then the items will get delivered to us

372
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,420
then the items will get delivered to us
 

373
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,640
then the items will get delivered to us
haven't decided how I want to do that

374
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:06,650
haven't decided how I want to do that
 

375
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,170
haven't decided how I want to do that
either they'll pop out of the floor or

376
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,180
either they'll pop out of the floor or
 

377
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,400
either they'll pop out of the floor or
fall from the ceiling

378
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,410
fall from the ceiling
 

379
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,460
fall from the ceiling
nearby here or maybe we'll put them in a

380
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,470
nearby here or maybe we'll put them in a
 

381
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,200
nearby here or maybe we'll put them in a
chest and there'll be an option to send

382
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,210
chest and there'll be an option to send
 

383
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,270
chest and there'll be an option to send
the items in the chest back to the

384
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,280
the items in the chest back to the
 

385
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,160
the items in the chest back to the
overflow chest and then they'll go back

386
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,170
overflow chest and then they'll go back
 

387
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,750
overflow chest and then they'll go back
into the system if we don't take them

388
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:22,760
into the system if we don't take them
 

389
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,390
into the system if we don't take them
out maybe but this obviously has a few

390
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,400
out maybe but this obviously has a few
 

391
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,840
out maybe but this obviously has a few
problems so I think the best way of

392
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:31,850
problems so I think the best way of
 

393
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,480
problems so I think the best way of
displaying information in Minecraft in

394
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,490
displaying information in Minecraft in
 

395
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,290
displaying information in Minecraft in
the most condensed possible way is

396
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,300
the most condensed possible way is
 

397
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,500
the most condensed possible way is
actually Maps so let's try this out

398
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,510
actually Maps so let's try this out
 

399
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,150
actually Maps so let's try this out
because the map is 128 by 128 pixels

400
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
because the map is 128 by 128 pixels
 

401
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,900
because the map is 128 by 128 pixels
that's a pretty high resolution and what

402
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:49,910
that's a pretty high resolution and what
 

403
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,580
that's a pretty high resolution and what
did I do with my item frames I think I

404
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:54,590
did I do with my item frames I think I
 

405
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,160
did I do with my item frames I think I
got rid of them let's grab an item for

406
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,170
got rid of them let's grab an item for
 

407
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,740
got rid of them let's grab an item for
him real quick

408
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,750
him real quick
 

409
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,890
him real quick
and I got a sleep here too probably

410
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:01,900
and I got a sleep here too probably
 

411
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,320
and I got a sleep here too probably
yeah okay so when you put the map in the

412
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,330
yeah okay so when you put the map in the
 

413
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,980
yeah okay so when you put the map in the
item frame it doesn't get down steeled

414
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:08,990
item frame it doesn't get down steeled
 

415
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,360
item frame it doesn't get down steeled
or anything it actually keeps the

416
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,370
or anything it actually keeps the
 

417
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,200
or anything it actually keeps the
resolution 128 by 128 so we could for

418
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,210
resolution 128 by 128 so we could for
 

419
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,470
resolution 128 by 128 so we could for
example have item frames all along the

420
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480
example have item frames all along the
 

421
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,940
example have item frames all along the
top here or somewhere nearby

422
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:18,950
top here or somewhere nearby
 

423
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,920
top here or somewhere nearby
and have the map there and bam look at

424
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:23,930
and have the map there and bam look at
 

425
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,440
and have the map there and bam look at
that all the pixels you can see every

426
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,450
that all the pixels you can see every
 

427
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,950
that all the pixels you can see every
single one uh-huh so we can draw stuff

428
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:31,960
single one uh-huh so we can draw stuff
 

429
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,930
single one uh-huh so we can draw stuff
set up an area somewhere where we draw

430
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:34,940
set up an area somewhere where we draw
 

431
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,150
set up an area somewhere where we draw
out the items and then the code for them

432
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,160
out the items and then the code for them
 

433
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,980
out the items and then the code for them
now keep in mind guys this is not a

434
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:41,990
now keep in mind guys this is not a
 

435
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,990
now keep in mind guys this is not a
great example but it does kind of show

436
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
great example but it does kind of show
 

437
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,370
great example but it does kind of show
how this could work

438
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:45,380
how this could work
 

439
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,710
how this could work
terrible color choices but you can see I

440
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:47,720
terrible color choices but you can see I
 

441
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,110
terrible color choices but you can see I
got purple and white over there

442
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,120
got purple and white over there
 

443
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,150
got purple and white over there
we can see it pretty clearly on our map

444
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
we can see it pretty clearly on our map
 

445
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,889
we can see it pretty clearly on our map
but I would want to make it a bit bigger

446
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:53,899
but I would want to make it a bit bigger
 

447
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,710
but I would want to make it a bit bigger
I think but we can see white and purple

448
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
I think but we can see white and purple
 

449
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,569
I think but we can see white and purple
dots on here we could use that as a code

450
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:00,579
dots on here we could use that as a code
 

451
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,069
dots on here we could use that as a code
probably white and black though or

452
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:03,079
probably white and black though or
 

453
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,439
probably white and black though or
something for some reason I got the

454
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:05,449
something for some reason I got the
 

455
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,189
something for some reason I got the
white as off and the purple as on and we

456
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:09,199
white as off and the purple as on and we
 

457
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,439
white as off and the purple as on and we
have our exact same code for the stake

458
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:11,449
have our exact same code for the stake
 

459
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,650
have our exact same code for the stake
that we had in our book here right so

460
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:14,660
that we had in our book here right so
 

461
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,360
that we had in our book here right so
then we would just need an identifier

462
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,370
then we would just need an identifier
 

463
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,110
then we would just need an identifier
next to it like either in text the word

464
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,120
next to it like either in text the word
 

465
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,970
next to it like either in text the word
stake or we could try to draw the the

466
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:24,980
stake or we could try to draw the the
 

467
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,179
stake or we could try to draw the the
stake icon here next to it so we could

468
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:28,189
stake icon here next to it so we could
 

469
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,509
stake icon here next to it so we could
have like a bunch of identifiers with

470
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
have like a bunch of identifiers with
 

471
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,569
have like a bunch of identifiers with
the code next to it all the way down 128

472
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:34,579
the code next to it all the way down 128
 

473
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:39,129
the code next to it all the way down 128
by 128 that gives us if we divide it by

474
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:39,139
by 128 that gives us if we divide it by
 

475
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:45,309
by 128 that gives us if we divide it by
16 that's 8 pixels tall for each item we

476
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:45,319
16 that's 8 pixels tall for each item we
 

477
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:48,749
16 that's 8 pixels tall for each item we
would have free if we split it in half

478
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:48,759
would have free if we split it in half
 

479
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,239
would have free if we split it in half
like a line down the map here with 16

480
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:52,249
like a line down the map here with 16
 

481
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,220
like a line down the map here with 16
items on this side 16 on this side

482
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,230
items on this side 16 on this side
 

483
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,299
items on this side 16 on this side
that's 32 we would have we would only

484
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:58,309
that's 32 we would have we would only
 

485
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,879
that's 32 we would have we would only
need 8 maps so one here one here here

486
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:00,889
need 8 maps so one here one here here
 

487
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,639
need 8 maps so one here one here here
here here here here here that would show

488
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:03,649
here here here here here that would show
 

489
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,679
here here here here here that would show
us all the items in our system and the

490
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:05,689
us all the items in our system and the
 

491
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,689
us all the items in our system and the
code for each of them readily available

492
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:07,699
code for each of them readily available
 

493
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,030
code for each of them readily available
you just walk up and look at it since

494
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,040
you just walk up and look at it since
 

495
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,499
you just walk up and look at it since
everything is arranged in groups it

496
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:11,509
everything is arranged in groups it
 

497
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,569
everything is arranged in groups it
would be pretty easy to find stuff I

498
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:13,579
would be pretty easy to find stuff I
 

499
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,319
would be pretty easy to find stuff I
think and within the screen we would be

500
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:17,329
think and within the screen we would be
 

501
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,379
think and within the screen we would be
able to see everything we need

502
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:19,389
able to see everything we need
 

503
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,509
able to see everything we need
uh-huh so I think that's a powerful way

504
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:22,519
uh-huh so I think that's a powerful way
 

505
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,579
uh-huh so I think that's a powerful way
of doing it it would be a big pain to

506
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:24,589
of doing it it would be a big pain to
 

507
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,009
of doing it it would be a big pain to
set this all up but I think it's the

508
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:27,019
set this all up but I think it's the
 

509
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,139
set this all up but I think it's the
best way of doing it so I think that's

510
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:29,149
best way of doing it so I think that's
 

511
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:36,220
best way of doing it so I think that's
what we'll go ahead with judging you

512
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,230
what we'll go ahead with judging you
 

513
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,660
what we'll go ahead with judging you

good
we're cool let's get out of here so I

554
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:52,550
we're cool let's get out of here so I
 

555
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,370
we're cool let's get out of here so I
want to go check out the poppy farm here

556
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,380
want to go check out the poppy farm here
 

557
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,050
want to go check out the poppy farm here
I haven't looked at it in a little while

558
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,060
I haven't looked at it in a little while
 

559
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,840
I haven't looked at it in a little while
but we got all the hoppers and stuff we

560
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:58,850
but we got all the hoppers and stuff we
 

561
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,970
but we got all the hoppers and stuff we
need for the Nexus which is why we built

562
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:00,980
need for the Nexus which is why we built
 

563
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,819
need for the Nexus which is why we built
this in the first place so now what do

564
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:03,829
this in the first place so now what do
 

565
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,430
this in the first place so now what do
we do with all the iron that that's a

566
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,440
we do with all the iron that that's a
 

567
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,710
we do with all the iron that that's a
extra by-product to the poppies we get

568
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:11,720
extra by-product to the poppies we get
 

569
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,800
extra by-product to the poppies we get
ah that's the question what do we do

570
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:14,810
ah that's the question what do we do
 

571
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,079
ah that's the question what do we do
with all this stuff I think what we're

572
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:17,089
with all this stuff I think what we're
 

573
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,829
with all this stuff I think what we're
gonna do is save this we'll still keep

574
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:20,839
gonna do is save this we'll still keep
 

575
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,680
gonna do is save this we'll still keep
it separate from our normal iron but

576
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:23,690
it separate from our normal iron but
 

577
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,660
it separate from our normal iron but
we'll use it to make beacons in the

578
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,670
we'll use it to make beacons in the
 

579
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,810
we'll use it to make beacons in the
future so we have two stacks of blocks

580
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:28,820
future so we have two stacks of blocks
 

581
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,730
future so we have two stacks of blocks
er we almost have enough for a full

582
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:30,740
er we almost have enough for a full
 

583
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,569
er we almost have enough for a full
beacon base because I got I got 12

584
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:34,579
beacon base because I got I got 12
 

585
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,949
beacon base because I got I got 12
beacons just sitting here and I can't

586
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:35,959
beacons just sitting here and I can't
 

587
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,360
beacons just sitting here and I can't
use them because I don't have enough

588
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,370
use them because I don't have enough
 

589
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,449
use them because I don't have enough
blocks to do it you know so I think

590
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:40,459
blocks to do it you know so I think
 

591
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,680
blocks to do it you know so I think
that's what we'll do in the future with

592
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:41,690
that's what we'll do in the future with
 

593
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,220
that's what we'll do in the future with
all this dirty iron and start setting up

594
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,230
all this dirty iron and start setting up
 

595
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,069
all this dirty iron and start setting up
beacons around our world we're going to

596
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
beacons around our world we're going to
 

597
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,860
beacons around our world we're going to
head back over to the Sand Village here

598
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:50,870
head back over to the Sand Village here
 

599
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,630
head back over to the Sand Village here
though sand sandy city let's see I think

600
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:55,640
though sand sandy city let's see I think
 

601
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,170
though sand sandy city let's see I think
what I want to do

602
00:14:59,170 --> 00:14:59,180

 

603
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,200

the man cave is over here we got the

604
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,210
the man cave is over here we got the
 

605
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,890
the man cave is over here we got the
path maybe what we'll do is just plan -

606
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:07,900

 

607
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,000

let's see maybe at this arch over here

608
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,010
let's see maybe at this arch over here
 

609
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,650
let's see maybe at this arch over here
well tear this out and we'll plan to put

610
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:17,660
well tear this out and we'll plan to put
 

611
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,220
well tear this out and we'll plan to put
a gate here that we can walk through um

612
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,230
a gate here that we can walk through um
 

613
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,400
a gate here that we can walk through um

to my surprise there wasn't really any

630
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
to my surprise there wasn't really any
 

631
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,990
to my surprise there wasn't really any
slime block ones like I thought there

632
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,000
slime block ones like I thought there
 

633
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,560
slime block ones like I thought there
would be I thought you know slime blocks

634
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:56,570
would be I thought you know slime blocks
 

635
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,730
would be I thought you know slime blocks
came out that would make it really

636
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:57,740
came out that would make it really
 

637
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,060
came out that would make it really
efficient but no maybe I just missed

638
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,070
efficient but no maybe I just missed
 

639
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,010
efficient but no maybe I just missed
them so I'm going to use an older that

640
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,020
them so I'm going to use an older that
 

641
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,180
them so I'm going to use an older that
doesn't look good I don't like the shape

642
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,190
doesn't look good I don't like the shape
 

643
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,980
doesn't look good I don't like the shape
to that I don't like it when it's like a

644
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:08,990
to that I don't like it when it's like a
 

645
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,000
to that I don't like it when it's like a
V you know um maybe we'll smooth it out

646
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,010
V you know um maybe we'll smooth it out
 

647
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,260
V you know um maybe we'll smooth it out
a bit more yeah I'm gonna use an older

648
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,270
a bit more yeah I'm gonna use an older
 

649
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,940
a bit more yeah I'm gonna use an older
design I don't know if we'll actually

650
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:18,950
design I don't know if we'll actually
 

651
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,330
design I don't know if we'll actually
get to building it today though the two

652
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,340
get to building it today though the two
 

653
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,800
get to building it today though the two
flats maybe oh maybe I could do it like

654
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:26,810
flats maybe oh maybe I could do it like
 

655
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,480
flats maybe oh maybe I could do it like
this and then do a stair here oh no I'm

656
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,490
this and then do a stair here oh no I'm
 

657
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,420
this and then do a stair here oh no I'm
bumping papers on my table here I've got

658
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,430
bumping papers on my table here I've got
 

659
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,220
bumping papers on my table here I've got
such a mess I got to clean it up yeah I

660
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,230
such a mess I got to clean it up yeah I
 

661
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,070
such a mess I got to clean it up yeah I
think that's better okay so we could

662
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,080
think that's better okay so we could
 

663
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,650
think that's better okay so we could
plan to have a date like this and then

664
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:41,660
plan to have a date like this and then
 

665
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,550
plan to have a date like this and then
we'll have two towers on both sides and

666
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
we'll have two towers on both sides and
 

667
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,320
we'll have two towers on both sides and
I think that would be pretty cool I

668
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,330
I think that would be pretty cool I
 

669
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,830
I think that would be pretty cool I
played around with I don't I don't think

670
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:50,840
played around with I don't I don't think
 

671
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,000
played around with I don't I don't think
we're going to build this today though I

672
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,010
we're going to build this today though I
 

673
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,550
we're going to build this today though I
don't have time but I played around with

674
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
don't have time but I played around with
 

675
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,680
don't have time but I played around with
the wall here a bit - I think we're

676
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:56,690
the wall here a bit - I think we're
 

677
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,520
the wall here a bit - I think we're
going to put dark oak maybe behind these

678
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,530
going to put dark oak maybe behind these
 

679
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,910
going to put dark oak maybe behind these
these little things here and uh yeah we

680
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:06,920
these little things here and uh yeah we
 

681
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,230
these little things here and uh yeah we
could put fences in front I played

682
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
could put fences in front I played
 

683
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,670
could put fences in front I played
around with that just to give it a bit

684
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:09,680
around with that just to give it a bit
 

685
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,800
around with that just to give it a bit
more depth and then for these like

686
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:11,810
more depth and then for these like
 

687
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,090
more depth and then for these like
archway things I'm going to

688
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,100
archway things I'm going to
 

689
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,890
archway things I'm going to
put the sandstone I think we could also

690
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:17,900
put the sandstone I think we could also
 

691
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,110
put the sandstone I think we could also
do something like this we got to keep

692
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,120
do something like this we got to keep
 

693
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,850
do something like this we got to keep
the Birchwood at the top though because

694
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:21,860
the Birchwood at the top though because
 

695
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,350
the Birchwood at the top though because
of this unfortunately but we could also

696
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
of this unfortunately but we could also
 

697
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,510
of this unfortunately but we could also
put stairs like this if we want a little

698
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
put stairs like this if we want a little
 

699
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,660
put stairs like this if we want a little
bit more detail but that might grab your

700
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:34,670
bit more detail but that might grab your
 

701
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,250
bit more detail but that might grab your
attention too much yeah I almost think

702
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,260
attention too much yeah I almost think
 

703
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,880
attention too much yeah I almost think
that's better

704
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:39,890
that's better
 

705
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,440
that's better
just just a flat wall alright maybe

706
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,450
just just a flat wall alright maybe
 

707
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,850
just just a flat wall alright maybe
we'll take a moment here to visit the

708
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:45,860
we'll take a moment here to visit the
 

709
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,550
we'll take a moment here to visit the
old stronghold base we haven't been here

710
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:48,560
old stronghold base we haven't been here
 

711
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,310
old stronghold base we haven't been here
much lately you guys don't know the

712
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,320
much lately you guys don't know the
 

713
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,440
much lately you guys don't know the
story behind this place we used to spend

714
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,450
story behind this place we used to spend
 

715
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,160
story behind this place we used to spend
a lot of time here and I basically just

716
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,170
a lot of time here and I basically just
 

717
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,100
a lot of time here and I basically just
took too long to build it wasn't happy

718
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,110
took too long to build it wasn't happy
 

719
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,900
took too long to build it wasn't happy
with the stuff I did I kept redoing it

720
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:01,910
with the stuff I did I kept redoing it
 

721
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,650
with the stuff I did I kept redoing it
and that was probably a mistake the game

722
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:05,660
and that was probably a mistake the game
 

723
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,560
and that was probably a mistake the game
changed a lot of things didn't work

724
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:08,570
changed a lot of things didn't work
 

725
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,390
changed a lot of things didn't work
quite the way I wanted them to anymore

726
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
quite the way I wanted them to anymore
 

727
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,930
quite the way I wanted them to anymore
and I specifically want to check out the

728
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:13,940
and I specifically want to check out the
 

729
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,640
and I specifically want to check out the
silverfish farm I'm curious if it still

730
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:15,650
silverfish farm I'm curious if it still
 

731
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:21,610
silverfish farm I'm curious if it still
works like in the past you used to need

732
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:21,620
works like in the past you used to need
 

733
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,240
works like in the past you used to need
50 levels to enchant something so I

734
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,250
50 levels to enchant something so I
 

735
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,370
50 levels to enchant something so I
wanted to have a silverfish farm running

736
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,380
wanted to have a silverfish farm running
 

737
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,300
wanted to have a silverfish farm running
all the time here that we could get XP

738
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,310
all the time here that we could get XP
 

739
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,420
all the time here that we could get XP
from then they reduced it down to 30 and

740
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,430
from then they reduced it down to 30 and
 

741
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,510
from then they reduced it down to 30 and
now today we basically don't need XP

742
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520

 

743
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,830

let's see now if I remember right there

744
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:44,840
let's see now if I remember right there
 

745
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,600
let's see now if I remember right there
was a way to make this trigger or did I

746
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,610
was a way to make this trigger or did I
 

747
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,430
was a way to make this trigger or did I
break this one day and I never fixed it

748
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,440
break this one day and I never fixed it
 

749
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,620
break this one day and I never fixed it
I wonder oh you know I almost remember

750
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:53,630
I wonder oh you know I almost remember
 

751
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,940
I wonder oh you know I almost remember
doing that there supposed to be a piston

752
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:57,950
doing that there supposed to be a piston
 

753
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,140
doing that there supposed to be a piston
somewhere I can update this is over here

754
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,150
somewhere I can update this is over here
 

755
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,710
somewhere I can update this is over here
or do I put them push the button I

756
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
or do I put them push the button I
 

757
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,050
or do I put them push the button I
killed them what is there any way we can

758
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,060
killed them what is there any way we can
 

759
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,420
killed them what is there any way we can
resurrect this guys and and make it do

760
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,430
resurrect this guys and and make it do
 

761
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,220
resurrect this guys and and make it do
something cool in the future that's what

762
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,230
something cool in the future that's what
 

763
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,560
something cool in the future that's what
I'm wondering because I love the

764
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,570
I'm wondering because I love the
 

765
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm wondering because I love the
silverfish farm but we never really did

766
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:19,910
silverfish farm but we never really did
 

767
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,710
silverfish farm but we never really did
use it we had some fun with it but we

768
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:23,720
use it we had some fun with it but we
 

769
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,240
use it we had some fun with it but we
never actually put it to use for

770
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,250
never actually put it to use for
 

771
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,410
never actually put it to use for
anything

772
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:31,420

 

773
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,250

doesn't look like they're going in the

774
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,260
doesn't look like they're going in the
 

775
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,160
doesn't look like they're going in the
blocks okay I just gave this a look over

776
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,170
blocks okay I just gave this a look over
 

777
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,510
blocks okay I just gave this a look over
and there's for sure some redstone

778
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:40,520
and there's for sure some redstone
 

779
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,660
and there's for sure some redstone
missing there's a piston back here so

780
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:43,670
missing there's a piston back here so
 

781
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,520
missing there's a piston back here so
this block pops out so I think there was

782
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:45,530
this block pops out so I think there was
 

783
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,580
this block pops out so I think there was
a torch there and I'm guessing a piece

784
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:48,590
a torch there and I'm guessing a piece
 

785
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,990
a torch there and I'm guessing a piece
of dust there or wood that might short

786
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,000
of dust there or wood that might short
 

787
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,430
of dust there or wood that might short
that out wait no that's probably right

788
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:56,440
that out wait no that's probably right
 

789
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,810
that out wait no that's probably right
there's some missing down here too so

790
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:58,820
there's some missing down here too so
 

791
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,170
there's some missing down here too so
I'm guessing maybe I had a repeater here

792
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,180
I'm guessing maybe I had a repeater here
 

793
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,270
I'm guessing maybe I had a repeater here
and then a piece of dust and hopefully

794
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
and then a piece of dust and hopefully
 

795
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,880
and then a piece of dust and hopefully
that fixes it I don't know yeah because

796
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:12,890
that fixes it I don't know yeah because
 

797
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,430
that fixes it I don't know yeah because
I spilled some water one day oh they're

798
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
I spilled some water one day oh they're
 

799
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,690
I spilled some water one day oh they're
falling out and I didn't know how to fix

800
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:19,700
falling out and I didn't know how to fix
 

801
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,460
falling out and I didn't know how to fix
it oh oh you just went in a block just

802
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,470
it oh oh you just went in a block just
 

803
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,540
it oh oh you just went in a block just
one in a block and it did something do

804
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,550
one in a block and it did something do
 

805
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,040
one in a block and it did something do
it again do it again come on come on I

806
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,050
it again do it again come on come on I
 

807
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,090
it again do it again come on come on I
know you can do it we almost got this

808
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:37,100
know you can do it we almost got this
 

809
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
know you can do it we almost got this
working again I think the only problem

810
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,610
working again I think the only problem
 

811
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,190
working again I think the only problem
this this wire has to turn on to

812
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,200
this this wire has to turn on to
 

813
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,490
this this wire has to turn on to
activate the stone generator and we're

814
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:45,500
activate the stone generator and we're
 

815
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,870
activate the stone generator and we're
not connected to it anywhere I'm

816
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
not connected to it anywhere I'm
 

817
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,830
not connected to it anywhere I'm
guessing I had it like this before but

818
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:50,840
guessing I had it like this before but
 

819
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,540
guessing I had it like this before but
like you can't send redstone down

820
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:52,550
like you can't send redstone down
 

821
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,780
like you can't send redstone down
through a stair unless it was different

822
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:55,790
through a stair unless it was different
 

823
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,630
through a stair unless it was different
in the past I don't understand what did

824
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
in the past I don't understand what did
 

825
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,100
in the past I don't understand what did
I do here does it make sense we could

826
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,110
I do here does it make sense we could
 

827
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:08,680
I do here does it make sense we could
try this just like solving a puzzle a

828
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:08,690
try this just like solving a puzzle a
 

829
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:19,720
try this just like solving a puzzle a
little of the past that might do it

830
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:19,730

 

831
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,560

come on do it again one more time oh man

832
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,570
come on do it again one more time oh man
 

833
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,280
come on do it again one more time oh man
we got two in a row there

834
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,290
we got two in a row there
 

835
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:37,940
we got two in a row there
two in a row guys for some reason this

836
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:37,950
two in a row guys for some reason this
 

837
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,060
two in a row guys for some reason this
is weird actually

838
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,070
is weird actually
 

839
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:48,160
is weird actually
it's like reverse now oh man

840
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,170
it's like reverse now oh man
 

841
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,770
it's like reverse now oh man
okay so in the past you have to walk far

842
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:51,780
okay so in the past you have to walk far
 

843
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,040
okay so in the past you have to walk far
away from this thing for it to work just

844
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,050
away from this thing for it to work just
 

845
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,880
away from this thing for it to work just
trigger it again and it seems to work

846
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:58,890
trigger it again and it seems to work
 

847
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,260
trigger it again and it seems to work
when I'm up close to them now like you

848
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,270
when I'm up close to them now like you
 

849
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,290
when I'm up close to them now like you
have to be think 16 blocks away four

850
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:03,300
have to be think 16 blocks away four
 

851
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,150
have to be think 16 blocks away four
from them for them for them to enter

852
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,160
from them for them for them to enter
 

853
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,270
from them for them for them to enter
into a block and now I can be right next

854
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,280
into a block and now I can be right next
 

855
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,970
into a block and now I can be right next
to them for some reason but yeah that's

856
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:13,980
to them for some reason but yeah that's
 

857
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,410
to them for some reason but yeah that's
working I might have to adjust the

858
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:15,420
working I might have to adjust the
 

859
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,670
working I might have to adjust the
timing but it's working now that is cool

860
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:18,680
timing but it's working now that is cool
 

861
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,320
timing but it's working now that is cool
yeah so if you got any fun ideas for

862
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,330
yeah so if you got any fun ideas for
 

863
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,000
yeah so if you got any fun ideas for
what we could do with the silverfish let

864
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,010
what we could do with the silverfish let
 

865
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,610
what we could do with the silverfish let
me know op the top of my head I'm

866
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:25,620
me know op the top of my head I'm
 

867
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,500
me know op the top of my head I'm
thinking maybe that arena we're building

868
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,510
thinking maybe that arena we're building
 

869
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,130
thinking maybe that arena we're building
if we could send them there and

870
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,140
if we could send them there and
 

871
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,300
if we could send them there and
incorporate them into the fight somehow

872
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,310
incorporate them into the fight somehow
 

873
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,970
incorporate them into the fight somehow
that would be cool uh-huh anyway let's

874
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:37,980
that would be cool uh-huh anyway let's
 

875
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,620
that would be cool uh-huh anyway let's
get to our comment for today it says hey

876
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,630
get to our comment for today it says hey
 

877
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,290
get to our comment for today it says hey
etho if you spend most of your time

878
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,300
etho if you spend most of your time
 

879
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,680
etho if you spend most of your time
building use mcedit to build for you but

880
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,690
building use mcedit to build for you but
 

881
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,690
building use mcedit to build for you but
when building the initial part to copy

882
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:47,700
when building the initial part to copy
 

883
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,150
when building the initial part to copy
work out the resources required and and

884
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,160
work out the resources required and and
 

885
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,120
work out the resources required and and
every time you use it to make a section

886
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,130
every time you use it to make a section
 

887
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,040
every time you use it to make a section
throw away that amount of blocks aha so

888
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,050
throw away that amount of blocks aha so
 

889
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,360
throw away that amount of blocks aha so
this is in response to episodes taking

890
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,370
this is in response to episodes taking
 

891
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,240
this is in response to episodes taking
too long and I don't think we're ever

892
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,250
too long and I don't think we're ever
 

893
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,800
too long and I don't think we're ever
gonna do anything like that I think that

894
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:06,810
gonna do anything like that I think that
 

895
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,450
gonna do anything like that I think that
would change the series too much if we

896
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:08,460
would change the series too much if we
 

897
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,450
would change the series too much if we
started using third-party programs to

898
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,460
started using third-party programs to
 

899
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,190
started using third-party programs to
build for us and I should probably

900
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
build for us and I should probably
 

901
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,500
build for us and I should probably
clarify something it's not that building

902
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,510
clarify something it's not that building
 

903
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,720
clarify something it's not that building
like actually placing the blocks takes a

904
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:17,730
like actually placing the blocks takes a
 

905
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,940
like actually placing the blocks takes a
long time it's the designing of the

906
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:19,950
long time it's the designing of the
 

907
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,750
long time it's the designing of the
building that takes the most time and

908
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:22,760
building that takes the most time and
 

909
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,210
building that takes the most time and
running back and forth collecting things

910
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,220
running back and forth collecting things
 

911
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,669
running back and forth collecting things
so hopefully when we get the storage

912
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:28,679
so hopefully when we get the storage
 

913
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,590
so hopefully when we get the storage
room the Nexus up and running that'll

914
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
room the Nexus up and running that'll
 

915
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,909
room the Nexus up and running that'll
help a little bit yeah I don't think

916
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:34,919
help a little bit yeah I don't think
 

917
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,490
help a little bit yeah I don't think
we'll will ever do that but thanks for

918
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:37,500
we'll will ever do that but thanks for
 

919
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,460
we'll will ever do that but thanks for
the suggestion but with that I think

920
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,470
the suggestion but with that I think
 

921
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,289
the suggestion but with that I think
we're going to wrap up our episode for

922
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:42,299
we're going to wrap up our episode for
 

923
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,060
we're going to wrap up our episode for
today guys if you have any ideas for the

924
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,070
today guys if you have any ideas for the
 

925
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,649
today guys if you have any ideas for the
things we've done let me know in the

926
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:45,659
things we've done let me know in the
 

927
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,490
things we've done let me know in the
comments I do I do check them and I will

928
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:49,500
comments I do I do check them and I will
 

929
