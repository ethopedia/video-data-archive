the Keesha down here I think that works

94
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:05,850
the Keesha down here I think that works
 

95
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,600
the Keesha down here I think that works
a lot better than than that now so I

96
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,610
a lot better than than that now so I
 

97
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,680
a lot better than than that now so I
kind of wanted to try that out like

98
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,690
kind of wanted to try that out like
 

99
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,050
kind of wanted to try that out like
maybe

100
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060

 

101
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,780

like for example it's thinking about

102
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:14,790
like for example it's thinking about
 

103
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,150
like for example it's thinking about
putting in some lines in the build we

104
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
putting in some lines in the build we
 

105
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,559
putting in some lines in the build we
got to get some more color into this

106
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:18,569
got to get some more color into this
 

107
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,250
got to get some more color into this
build there's a really important thing

108
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,260
build there's a really important thing
 

109
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,540
build there's a really important thing
maybe we could do stuff like this just

110
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,550
maybe we could do stuff like this just
 

111
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,570
maybe we could do stuff like this just
like do that's turn it over and now we

112
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,580
like do that's turn it over and now we
 

113
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,509
like do that's turn it over and now we
have like a little bit of color mixed in

114
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,519
have like a little bit of color mixed in
 

115
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,080
have like a little bit of color mixed in
right

116
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,090
right
 

117
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
right
even I don't know if you can see it but

118
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,430
even I don't know if you can see it but
 

119
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,280
even I don't know if you can see it but
there's actually some smooth stone here

120
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,290
there's actually some smooth stone here
 

121
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,140
there's actually some smooth stone here
which I tried to make it stand out a bit

122
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,150
which I tried to make it stand out a bit
 

123
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
which I tried to make it stand out a bit
more but you can't really see it cuz

124
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:40,890
more but you can't really see it cuz
 

125
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,990
more but you can't really see it cuz
it's the same color

126
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
it's the same color
 

127
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,990
it's the same color
maybe we get rid of those and just add

128
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,000
maybe we get rid of those and just add
 

129
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,979
maybe we get rid of those and just add
that in here and basically I'm gonna go

130
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:48,989
that in here and basically I'm gonna go
 

131
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,330
that in here and basically I'm gonna go
around the city here and try out a bunch

132
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,340
around the city here and try out a bunch
 

133
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,350
around the city here and try out a bunch
of a bunch of detail that might be cool

134
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,360
of a bunch of detail that might be cool
 

135
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,080
of a bunch of detail that might be cool
right even on the walls we could do that

136
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,090
right even on the walls we could do that
 

137
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,770
right even on the walls we could do that
like maybe you might want to do it over

138
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:00,780
like maybe you might want to do it over
 

139
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,449
like maybe you might want to do it over
here just run like color color strips

140
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:05,459
here just run like color color strips
 

141
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,949
here just run like color color strips
around here I think it'll look kind of

142
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
around here I think it'll look kind of
 

143
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,229
around here I think it'll look kind of
good for the houses this dark oak

144
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
good for the houses this dark oak
 

145
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,570
good for the houses this dark oak
I find stands out quite a bit so I'm

146
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:14,580
I find stands out quite a bit so I'm
 

147
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,620
I find stands out quite a bit so I'm
thinking either we change it to this

148
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,630
thinking either we change it to this
 

149
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,970
thinking either we change it to this
like that looks a lot better in my

150
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:19,980
like that looks a lot better in my
 

151
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,650
like that looks a lot better in my
opinion or we might even change it to

152
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:21,660
opinion or we might even change it to
 

153
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,319
opinion or we might even change it to
two oak this is what color I wish

154
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,329
two oak this is what color I wish
 

155
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,270

sandstone actually was instead of the

156
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
sandstone actually was instead of the
 

157
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,979
sandstone actually was instead of the
kind of the brighter yellow this would

158
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:27,989
kind of the brighter yellow this would
 

159
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,380
kind of the brighter yellow this would
be perfect for sandstone okay and I

160
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,390
be perfect for sandstone okay and I
 

161
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,569
be perfect for sandstone okay and I
think we're gonna like start putting

162
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:34,579
think we're gonna like start putting

think we're gonna like start putting
stairs here create a bit of a shadow

164
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
stairs here create a bit of a shadow
 

165
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,009
stairs here create a bit of a shadow
make it stand out a bit more something

166
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:43,019
make it stand out a bit more something
 

167
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:43,670
make it stand out a bit more something
like that

168
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
like that
 

169
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,960
like that
uh-huh yep yep so I did that I did some

170
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:47,970

172
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,430
stuff here some stuff got done and let's
 

173
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,490
stuff here some stuff got done and let's
check out some of said stuff all right

174
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:52,500
check out some of said stuff all right
 

175
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,830
check out some of said stuff all right
so overall I think it looks a little bit

176
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,840
so overall I think it looks a little bit
 

177
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,780
so overall I think it looks a little bit
better now I'm I'm happy with that the

178
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:56,790
better now I'm I'm happy with that the
 

179
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,629
better now I'm I'm happy with that the
oak stripped bark is pretty nice it's

180
00:03:59,629 --> 00:03:59,639
oak stripped bark is pretty nice it's
 

181
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,699
oak stripped bark is pretty nice it's
that sandstone color we all wish we had

182
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:01,709
that sandstone color we all wish we had
 

183
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,309
that sandstone color we all wish we had
but just mixing in with the sandstone

184
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
but just mixing in with the sandstone
 

185
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,259
but just mixing in with the sandstone
does kind of bring the overall build

186
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:06,269
does kind of bring the overall build
 

187
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,530
does kind of bring the overall build
towards that color at least I did that

188
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:09,540
towards that color at least I did that
 

189
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,009
towards that color at least I did that
in a melon tree and with the buildings I

190
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:13,019
in a melon tree and with the buildings I
 

191
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,960
in a melon tree and with the buildings I
just added in some color strips on the

193
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,879
just added in some color strips on the
sides as well using different colors of

194
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:16,889
sides as well using different colors of
 

195
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,650
sides as well using different colors of
clay you got yellow and green on the

196
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:18,660
clay you got yellow and green on the
 

197
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,990
clay you got yellow and green on the
side added some flower pots here some

198
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,000

201
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,820
banners we got the original etho banner
there

202
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:24,830
there
 

203
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,629
there
and I'd do anything on the side it's the

204
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
and I'd do anything on the side it's the
 

205
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,950
and I'd do anything on the side it's the
banner over there banner I barely know

206
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
banner over there banner I barely know
 

207
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,379
banner over there banner I barely know
her um never heard that one before no

208
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:37,389
her um never heard that one before no
 

209
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,119

all right so I do like the gates with

210
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:40,129
all right so I do like the gates with
 

211
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,369
all right so I do like the gates with
the acacia here I put it all along the

212
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:42,379
the acacia here I put it all along the
 

213
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,020
the acacia here I put it all along the
walls here and I think that looks a bit

214
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,030
walls here and I think that looks a bit
 

215
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,920
walls here and I think that looks a bit
weird right

216
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:44,930
weird right
 

217
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,719
weird right
am I crazy I don't think I'm crazy I

218
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:46,729
am I crazy I don't think I'm crazy I
 

219
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,820
am I crazy I don't think I'm crazy I
think it's too much too much of the

220
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:48,830
think it's too much too much of the
 

221
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,490
think it's too much too much of the
lines so we'll probably want to tone

222
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,500
lines so we'll probably want to tone
 

223
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,430
lines so we'll probably want to tone
that down a bit I think maybe change to

224
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,440
that down a bit I think maybe change to
 

225
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,540
that down a bit I think maybe change to

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,760
it occurred to me he probably died
because of the water updates as it

320
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:24,770
because of the water updates as it
 

321
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,189
because of the water updates as it
weren't perfectly fine for so long and

322
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
weren't perfectly fine for so long and
 

323
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
weren't perfectly fine for so long and
now he's is gone so I'm guessing some

324
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,090
now he's is gone so I'm guessing some
 

325
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,390
now he's is gone so I'm guessing some
physics of changing the game and he got

326
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
physics of changing the game and he got
 

327
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,589
physics of changing the game and he got
stuck somewhere and drowned in the water

328
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
stuck somewhere and drowned in the water
 

329
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,050
stuck somewhere and drowned in the water
but anyways guys it is that time again

330
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,060
but anyways guys it is that time again
 

331
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,149
but anyways guys it is that time again
where I do something I know I shouldn't

332
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:43,159
where I do something I know I shouldn't
 

333
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,180
where I do something I know I shouldn't
do but I'm gonna do it anyways and you

334
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,190
do but I'm gonna do it anyways and you
 

335

can't stop me haha I'm going to be not
 

337
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,800
can't stop me haha I'm going to be not
ending the episode like you thought I am

338
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:50,810
ending the episode like you thought I am
 

339
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,499
ending the episode like you thought I am
going to be starting a new project

340
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:53,509
going to be starting a new project
 

341
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,800
going to be starting a new project
that's right aha we're gonna be making a

342
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:56,810
that's right aha we're gonna be making a
 

343
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,570
that's right aha we're gonna be making a
game called mastermind I'm actually

344
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:58,580
game called mastermind I'm actually
 

345
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,930
game called mastermind I'm actually
pretty excited about this a little bit

346
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:01,940
pretty excited about this a little bit
 

347
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,430
pretty excited about this a little bit
of backstory I played this game when I

348
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
of backstory I played this game when I
 

349
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,159
of backstory I played this game when I
was like I don't know how old I was I

350
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:06,169
was like I don't know how old I was I
 

351
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,680
was like I don't know how old I was I
was a kid right and I have never once

352
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,690
was a kid right and I have never once
 

353
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,740
was a kid right and I have never once
seen this game again like you know when

354
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:11,750
seen this game again like you know when
 

355
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,480
seen this game again like you know when
you go to someone's house and you check

356
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,490
you go to someone's house and you check
 

357
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,059
you go to someone's house and you check
their closet they got monopoly if if

358
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:16,069
their closet they got monopoly if if
 

359
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,529
their closet they got monopoly if if
you're lucky they might have

360
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:17,539
you're lucky they might have
 

361
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,980
you're lucky they might have
scattegories or taboo or something or my

362
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:20,990
scattegories or taboo or something or my
 

363
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,779
scattegories or taboo or something or my
all-time favorite board game guys you

364
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:22,789
all-time favorite board game guys you
 

365
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,999
all-time favorite board game guys you
know what it is it's the best game

366
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,009
know what it is it's the best game
 

367
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,100
know what it is it's the best game
careers if you've never played careers

368
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,110
careers if you've never played careers
 

369
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,430
careers if you've never played careers
before you you've not lived or not had a

370
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,440
before you you've not lived or not had a
 

371
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,790
before you you've not lived or not had a
good dinner party or whatever aha

372
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:33,800
good dinner party or whatever aha
 

373
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,120
good dinner party or whatever aha
anyways play the game called mastermind

374
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,130
anyways play the game called mastermind
 

375
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,579
anyways play the game called mastermind
a long time ago haven't played it since

376
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:38,589
a long time ago haven't played it since
 

377
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,199
a long time ago haven't played it since
I'm gonna try to recreate it in

378
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:41,209
I'm gonna try to recreate it in
 

379
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm gonna try to recreate it in
Minecraft with slightly different rules

380
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,010
Minecraft with slightly different rules
 

381
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,350
Minecraft with slightly different rules
possibly because I don't know the rules

382
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
possibly because I don't know the rules
 

383
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,140
possibly because I don't know the rules
I read the wiki article on it and I

384
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,150
I read the wiki article on it and I
 

385
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,790
I read the wiki article on it and I
still don't quite understand

386
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:51,800
still don't quite understand
 

387
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,509
still don't quite understand
and them so I'm gonna do what's easiest

388
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:54,519
and them so I'm gonna do what's easiest
 

389
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,550
and them so I'm gonna do what's easiest
in Minecraft and it'll be pretty close I

390
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
in Minecraft and it'll be pretty close I
 

391
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,840
in Minecraft and it'll be pretty close I
think anyway so this is like a puzzle

392
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:01,850
think anyway so this is like a puzzle
 

393
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,190
think anyway so this is like a puzzle
game don't worry I'll guide you through

394
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
game don't worry I'll guide you through
 

395
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,519
game don't worry I'll guide you through
what we got to do here yeah so these are

396
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:06,529
what we got to do here yeah so these are
 

397
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,769
what we got to do here yeah so these are
the basic rules to mastermind as I

398
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:08,779
the basic rules to mastermind as I
 

399
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,210
the basic rules to mastermind as I
understand it what we got to try

400
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,220
understand it what we got to try
 

401
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,060
understand it what we got to try
recreate in Minecraft here it's meant to

402
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,070
recreate in Minecraft here it's meant to
 

403
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,490
recreate in Minecraft here it's meant to
be a two-player like puzzle game the

404
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:15,500
be a two-player like puzzle game the
 

405
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,460
be a two-player like puzzle game the
second player what he does is before the

406
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:18,470
second player what he does is before the
 

407
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,040
second player what he does is before the
game starts you get these six color pegs

408
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,050
game starts you get these six color pegs
 

409
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,930
game starts you get these six color pegs
we're gonna use concrete powder to

410
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:22,940
we're gonna use concrete powder to
 

411
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,550
we're gonna use concrete powder to
represent them

412
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
represent them
 

413
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,050
represent them
and he's supposed to set up a secret

414
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,060
and he's supposed to set up a secret
 

415
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,960
and he's supposed to set up a secret
code you have to try guess before the

416
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:28,970
code you have to try guess before the
 

417
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,519
code you have to try guess before the
game starts so he might do something

418
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:30,529
game starts so he might do something
 

419
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:37,060
game starts so he might do something
like red red yellow green okay and he

420
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,070
like red red yellow green okay and he
 

421
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,949
like red red yellow green okay and he
sets that up a I'm not allowed to see

422
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
sets that up a I'm not allowed to see
 

423
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,720
sets that up a I'm not allowed to see
that as a player guessing the code and

424
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,730
that as a player guessing the code and
 

425
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,569
that as a player guessing the code and
what I do I have up to 12 guesses here

426
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:43,579
what I do I have up to 12 guesses here
 

427
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,060
what I do I have up to 12 guesses here
where I gotta try figure out what the

428
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,070
where I gotta try figure out what the
 

429
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,730
where I gotta try figure out what the
code is so I'm up when I first started

430
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:48,740
code is so I'm up when I first started
 

431
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,720
code is so I'm up when I first started
out I'll probably just do something

432
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:49,730
out I'll probably just do something
 

433
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,579
out I'll probably just do something
random like I might do green red purple

434
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:53,589
random like I might do green red purple
 

435
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,120
random like I might do green red purple
blue and then if we go and check the

436
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,130
blue and then if we go and check the
 

437
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,860
blue and then if we go and check the
sighting player then like looks at what

438
00:09:59,860 --> 00:09:59,870
sighting player then like looks at what
 

439
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,150
sighting player then like looks at what
I did and he's supposed to provide

440
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
I did and he's supposed to provide
 

441
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,460
I did and he's supposed to provide
feedback on how close I was to guessing

442
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,470
feedback on how close I was to guessing
 

443
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,010
feedback on how close I was to guessing
the the code here and he does it in two

444
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,020
the the code here and he does it in two
 

445
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,120
the the code here and he does it in two
ways first he checks if any of my pegs

446
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,130
ways first he checks if any of my pegs
 

447
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,690
ways first he checks if any of my pegs
line up both in color and position so

448
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:13,700
line up both in color and position so
 

449
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,790
line up both in color and position so
green and red don't line up red and red

450
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
green and red don't line up red and red
 

451
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,780
green and red don't line up red and red
do purple and yellow don't blue and

452
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:19,790
do purple and yellow don't blue and
 

453
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,210
do purple and yellow don't blue and
green don't so he would award me because

454
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,220
green don't so he would award me because
 

455
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,550
green don't so he would award me because
I got one right I think he would give

456
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
I got one right I think he would give
 

457
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,210
I got one right I think he would give
you a black peg and he would put that

458
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,220
you a black peg and he would put that
 

459
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,269
you a black peg and he would put that
next to our guess and as you would

460
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
next to our guess and as you would
 

461
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,829
next to our guess and as you would
expect if we had gotten two of these

462
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:32,839
expect if we had gotten two of these
 

463
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,610
expect if we had gotten two of these
rights just by some random lucky chance

464
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:35,620
rights just by some random lucky chance
 

465
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,689
rights just by some random lucky chance
let's say we had a green one there

466
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:37,699
let's say we had a green one there
 

467
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,260
let's say we had a green one there
instead the red and the green both lined

468
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,270
instead the red and the green both lined
 

469
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,699
instead the red and the green both lined
up so we would have gotten two black

470
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:42,709
up so we would have gotten two black
 

471
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,829
up so we would have gotten two black
pegs so we know we got two of them right

472
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
pegs so we know we got two of them right
 

473
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,510
pegs so we know we got two of them right
but we don't know which ones like it

474
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:46,520
but we don't know which ones like it
 

475
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,250
but we don't know which ones like it
could be any of the four right so we got

476
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,260
could be any of the four right so we got
 

477
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,019
could be any of the four right so we got
to keep making guesses try to figure out

478
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:50,029
to keep making guesses try to figure out
 

479
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,019
to keep making guesses try to figure out
which ones it is by alternating up our

480
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:53,029
which ones it is by alternating up our
 

481
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,050
which ones it is by alternating up our
colors and there's one more way that the

482
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,060
colors and there's one more way that the
 

483
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,040
colors and there's one more way that the
second player is supposed to give us

484
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,050
second player is supposed to give us
 

485
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,230
second player is supposed to give us
feedback he checks if any of the colors

486
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,240
feedback he checks if any of the colors
 

487
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,260
feedback he checks if any of the colors
in our guests matches the colors in the

488
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,270
in our guests matches the colors in the
 

489
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,660
in our guests matches the colors in the
answer so if that was our guests over

490
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:04,670
answer so if that was our guests over
 

491
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,120
answer so if that was our guests over
there

492
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,130
there
 

493
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,320
there
and this is the answer there's no purple

494
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,330
and this is the answer there's no purple
 

495
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,060
and this is the answer there's no purple
in the answer there's no orange but

496
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,070
in the answer there's no orange but
 

497
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,880
in the answer there's no orange but
there is blue we guessed one blue and

498
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:13,890
there is blue we guessed one blue and
 

499
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,920
there is blue we guessed one blue and
there's two blue so I think we would get

500
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:15,930
there's two blue so I think we would get
 

501
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,640
there's two blue so I think we would get
one one white peg no black pegs because

502
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,650
one one white peg no black pegs because
 

503
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,370
one one white peg no black pegs because
none of them line up in position all

504
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:22,380
none of them line up in position all
 

505
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,350
none of them line up in position all
right so this is all the feedback we

506
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,360
right so this is all the feedback we
 

507
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,090
right so this is all the feedback we
would get if we were to do like green

508
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,100
would get if we were to do like green
 

509
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,040
would get if we were to do like green
blue purple purple then again nothing

510
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,050
blue purple purple then again nothing
 

511
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,050
blue purple purple then again nothing
lines up no black pegs but we do have

512
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,060
lines up no black pegs but we do have
 

513
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,720
lines up no black pegs but we do have
green and our guests and we have blue so

514
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:41,730
green and our guests and we have blue so
 

515
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,300
green and our guests and we have blue so
then the next guess we would get awarded

516
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,310
then the next guess we would get awarded
 

517
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,360
then the next guess we would get awarded
two of these so essentially our goal

518
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,370
two of these so essentially our goal
 

519
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,490
two of these so essentially our goal
with this project is to recreate the

520
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:49,500
with this project is to recreate the
 

521
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,440
with this project is to recreate the
second player out of red stone because

522
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,450
second player out of red stone because
 

523
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,480
second player out of red stone because
they don't really play the game they

524
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,490
they don't really play the game they
 

525
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,160
they don't really play the game they
just give us feedback on what we're

526
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,170
just give us feedback on what we're
 

527
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,550
just give us feedback on what we're
doing the reason for that is because the

528
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
doing the reason for that is because the
 

529
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
doing the reason for that is because the
game was made in the 1970s right and

530
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:00,810
game was made in the 1970s right and
 

531
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,810
game was made in the 1970s right and
they didn't really have micro processors

532
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
they didn't really have micro processors
 

533
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,360
they didn't really have micro processors
to put into games back then right

534
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,370
to put into games back then right
 

535
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,030
to put into games back then right
so they used the second player to give

536
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
so they used the second player to give
 

537
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,520
so they used the second player to give
to do the work of a computer basically

538
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,530
to do the work of a computer basically
 

539
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,770
to do the work of a computer basically
to give us feedback because we can't see

540
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:12,780
to give us feedback because we can't see
 

541
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,360
to give us feedback because we can't see
the answer otherwise it ruins the game

542
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,370
the answer otherwise it ruins the game
 

543
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,490
the answer otherwise it ruins the game
they need someone with that knowledge

544
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,500
they need someone with that knowledge
 

545
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,460
they need someone with that knowledge
that can provide feedback on what we're

546
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,470
that can provide feedback on what we're
 

547
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,710
that can provide feedback on what we're
doing so we're going to try to recreate

548
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:21,720
doing so we're going to try to recreate
 

549
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,270
doing so we're going to try to recreate
that a red stone it's really just like a

550
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,280
that a red stone it's really just like a
 

551
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,620
that a red stone it's really just like a
single player game there was a system

552
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:27,630
single player game there was a system
 

553
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,910
single player game there was a system
like where you would play multiple

554
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:28,920
like where you would play multiple
 

555
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,110
like where you would play multiple
rounds and the second player gets

556
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,120
rounds and the second player gets
 

557
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,940
rounds and the second player gets
awarded points based on how many guesses

558
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:31,950
awarded points based on how many guesses
 

559
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,490
awarded points based on how many guesses
it took you to get the answer right up

560
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:34,500
it took you to get the answer right up
 

561
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,160
it took you to get the answer right up
to 12 if you go over 12 you kind of just

562
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,170
to 12 if you go over 12 you kind of just
 

563
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,960
to 12 if you go over 12 you kind of just
lose the round to get the full 12 points

564
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:38,970
lose the round to get the full 12 points
 

565
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,330
lose the round to get the full 12 points
but we're gonna avoid all of that part

566
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,340
but we're gonna avoid all of that part
 

567
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,190
but we're gonna avoid all of that part
of the game and just make a single

568
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
of the game and just make a single
 

569
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,820
of the game and just make a single
player puzzle game basically so let's

570
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:46,830
player puzzle game basically so let's
 

571
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,490
player puzzle game basically so let's
get to it here now here's the thing

572
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:49,500
get to it here now here's the thing
 

573
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
get to it here now here's the thing
about this game guys it's actually

574
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,150
about this game guys it's actually
 

575
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,840
about this game guys it's actually
fairly complex like you think of a game

576
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:53,850
fairly complex like you think of a game
 

577
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,910
fairly complex like you think of a game
like paper-rock-scissors even that's

578
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
like paper-rock-scissors even that's
 

579
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,530
like paper-rock-scissors even that's
kind of challenging to do a Minecraft

580
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:57,540
kind of challenging to do a Minecraft
 

581
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,230
kind of challenging to do a Minecraft
and the more complex a game gets like we

582
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
and the more complex a game gets like we
 

583
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,770
and the more complex a game gets like we
have a lot of input data here

584
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:03,780
have a lot of input data here
 

585
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,960
have a lot of input data here
16:4 colors means we need at least three

586
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:05,970
16:4 colors means we need at least three
 

587
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,540
16:4 colors means we need at least three
bits per peg rights if we're to convert

588
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,550
bits per peg rights if we're to convert
 

589
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,850
bits per peg rights if we're to convert
a purely to redstone then you get four

590
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860
a purely to redstone then you get four
 

591
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,040
a purely to redstone then you get four
pegs three times twelve or three times

592
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,050
pegs three times twelve or three times
 

593
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,440
pegs three times twelve or three times
four is twelve twelve guesses if we want

594
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,450
four is twelve twelve guesses if we want
 

595
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,850
four is twelve twelve guesses if we want
to store all the guesses somehow that's

596
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:16,860
to store all the guesses somehow that's
 

597
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,769
to store all the guesses somehow that's
100

598
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:17,779
100
 

599
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,679
100
and 44 bits of data guys insane right so

600
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:23,689
and 44 bits of data guys insane right so
 

601
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,179
and 44 bits of data guys insane right so
we don't want to purely make it out of

602
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,189
we don't want to purely make it out of
 

603
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:26,949
we don't want to purely make it out of
redstone we need to come up with tricks

604
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
redstone we need to come up with tricks
 

605
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,530
redstone we need to come up with tricks
and and clever ideas using minecraft

606
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,540
and and clever ideas using minecraft
 

607
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,139
and and clever ideas using minecraft
mechanics to make the game easier this

608
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:32,149
mechanics to make the game easier this
 

609
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,629
mechanics to make the game easier this
is what I came up with recently this is

610
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
is what I came up with recently this is
 

611
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,160
is what I came up with recently this is
why I'm so excited because I think this

612
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,170
why I'm so excited because I think this
 

613
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,819
why I'm so excited because I think this
is the answer what we're gonna do store

614
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:39,829
is the answer what we're gonna do store
 

615
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,679
is the answer what we're gonna do store
the answer in item form like that and

616
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:41,689
the answer in item form like that and
 

617
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,900
the answer in item form like that and
we're gonna use minecraft item stacking

618
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:43,910
we're gonna use minecraft item stacking
 

619
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,869
we're gonna use minecraft item stacking
mechanics to simplify this game a lot so

620
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:46,879
mechanics to simplify this game a lot so
 

621
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,259
mechanics to simplify this game a lot so
let's say our guess is green red red

622
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:52,269
let's say our guess is green red red
 

623
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,009
let's say our guess is green red red
green okay that's our guess what we're

624
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:57,019
green okay that's our guess what we're
 

625
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,170
green okay that's our guess what we're
gonna do

626
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,180
gonna do
 

627
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,970
gonna do
convert the blocks into item form we

628
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:00,980
convert the blocks into item form we
 

629
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,939
convert the blocks into item form we
will throw one this way Green doesn't

630
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:03,949
will throw one this way Green doesn't
 

631
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,619
will throw one this way Green doesn't
stack with orange so it goes to the

632
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:05,629
stack with orange so it goes to the
 

633
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,150
stack with orange so it goes to the
pressure plates red that one does stack

634
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,160
pressure plates red that one does stack
 

635
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,350
pressure plates red that one does stack
red goes to the pressure plates green so

636
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360
red goes to the pressure plates green so
 

637
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,590
red goes to the pressure plates green so
we know one of them or no two of them

638
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
we know one of them or no two of them
 

639
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,299
we know one of them or no two of them
lines up we know we need to award two

640
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:22,309
lines up we know we need to award two
 

641
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,170
lines up we know we need to award two
black pegs by doing that right that's

642
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,180
black pegs by doing that right that's
 

643
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,759
black pegs by doing that right that's
that's the trick this is how we're gonna

644
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:27,769
that's the trick this is how we're gonna
 

645
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,480
that's the trick this is how we're gonna
do it hmm you know I just realized this

646
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,490
do it hmm you know I just realized this
 

647
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,949
do it hmm you know I just realized this
might be a bit more complicated I

648
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
might be a bit more complicated I
 

649
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,400
might be a bit more complicated I
thought I thought we could use a golden

650
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,410
thought I thought we could use a golden
 

651
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,629
thought I thought we could use a golden
pressure plate for figuring out the

652
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:37,639
pressure plate for figuring out the
 

653
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,240
pressure plate for figuring out the
white tags and after doing some testing

654
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,250
white tags and after doing some testing
 

655
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,819
white tags and after doing some testing
on paper here I realized no it's a bit

656
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:42,829
on paper here I realized no it's a bit
 

657
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,949
on paper here I realized no it's a bit
more complex but let's look at another

658
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
more complex but let's look at another
 

659
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,850
more complex but let's look at another
example here so let's say the answer is

660
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:48,860
example here so let's say the answer is
 

661
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,879
example here so let's say the answer is
purple green blue yellow this is our

662
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:51,889
purple green blue yellow this is our
 

663
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,879
purple green blue yellow this is our
guest purple orange orange green so

664
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:54,889
guest purple orange orange green so
 

665
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,679
guest purple orange orange green so
purple and purple line up in both

666
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:56,689
purple and purple line up in both
 

667
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,329
purple and purple line up in both
position and color we would get one

668
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:58,339
position and color we would get one
 

669
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,990
position and color we would get one
black peg orange and green nope orange

670
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
black peg orange and green nope orange
 

671
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,210
black peg orange and green nope orange
and blue nope green and yellow nope so

672
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:04,220
and blue nope green and yellow nope so
 

673
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,879
and blue nope green and yellow nope so
just one black peg but we do have green

674
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:06,889
just one black peg but we do have green
 

675
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,710
just one black peg but we do have green
and our answer and we have green in our

676
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
and our answer and we have green in our
 

677
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,389
and our answer and we have green in our
guests so we would get one white peg

678
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
guests so we would get one white peg
 

679
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,369
guests so we would get one white peg
that's where split we're supposed to get

680
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:12,379
that's where split we're supposed to get
 

681
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,569
that's where split we're supposed to get
one black one white if we do the

682
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:15,579
one black one white if we do the
 

683
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,610
one black one white if we do the
calculation here ooh you see that stacks

684
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:18,620
calculation here ooh you see that stacks
 

685
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,939
calculation here ooh you see that stacks
orange goes right through on both of

686
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:21,949
orange goes right through on both of
 

687
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:25,480
orange goes right through on both of
those and green also goes through so

688
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,490
those and green also goes through so
 

689
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,040
those and green also goes through so
three of the pressure plates will get

690
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,050
three of the pressure plates will get
 

691
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,419
three of the pressure plates will get
pressed down this is how we figure out

692
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:28,429
pressed down this is how we figure out
 

693
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,639
pressed down this is how we figure out
the black pegs depending on the number

694
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:30,649
the black pegs depending on the number
 

695
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:31,600
the black pegs depending on the number
of items on pressure

696
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:31,610
of items on pressure
 

697
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,690
of items on pressure
it's we have three so for three we would

698
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:34,700
it's we have three so for three we would
 

699
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,420
it's we have three so for three we would
get one black peg if there's none that

700
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,430
get one black peg if there's none that
 

701
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,160
get one black peg if there's none that
means we won we guessed the code

702
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,170
means we won we guessed the code
 

703
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,350
means we won we guessed the code
correctly because they'll all stick to

704
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
correctly because they'll all stick to
 

705
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,900
correctly because they'll all stick to
our answer they'll stack their fall four

706
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:46,910
our answer they'll stack their fall four
 

707
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,240
our answer they'll stack their fall four
of these pressure plates are down that

708
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,250
of these pressure plates are down that
 

709
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,430
of these pressure plates are down that
means we get no black pegs then what we

710
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
means we get no black pegs then what we
 

711
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160
means we get no black pegs then what we
do guys we take the same exact item

712
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,170
do guys we take the same exact item
 

713
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,269
do guys we take the same exact item
stacking trick and we use it on guess on

714
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:58,279
stacking trick and we use it on guess on
 

715
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,460
stacking trick and we use it on guess on
figuring out the white pegs as well so

716
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,470
figuring out the white pegs as well so
 

717
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,840
figuring out the white pegs as well so
it's almost like we're killing two birds

718
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:01,850
it's almost like we're killing two birds
 

719
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,759
it's almost like we're killing two birds
in one stone here we're doing the two

720
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:03,769
in one stone here we're doing the two
 

721
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,310
in one stone here we're doing the two
most complicated calculations in our

722
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
most complicated calculations in our
 

723
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,889
most complicated calculations in our
game using the same item stacking trick

724
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:08,899
game using the same item stacking trick
 

725
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,410
game using the same item stacking trick
so we had orange orange green on the

726
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:11,420
so we had orange orange green on the
 

727
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,569
so we had orange orange green on the
pressure plates here we take those and

728
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:13,579
pressure plates here we take those and
 

729
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,860
pressure plates here we take those and
we run them through our answer this way

730
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:16,870
we run them through our answer this way
 

731
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,650
we run them through our answer this way
orange orange goes right through all

732
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:20,660
orange orange goes right through all
 

733
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,500
orange orange goes right through all
four of those but green will stick all

734
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:23,510
four of those but green will stick all
 

735
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,019
four of those but green will stick all
right so there's gonna be two items in

736
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:26,029
right so there's gonna be two items in
 

737
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,460
right so there's gonna be two items in
the hopper and I thought we could do

738
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
the hopper and I thought we could do
 

739
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,120
the hopper and I thought we could do
this but we can't after some testing the

740
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,130
this but we can't after some testing the
 

741
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,550
this but we can't after some testing the
actual calculation we need to figure out

742
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
actual calculation we need to figure out
 

743
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,160
actual calculation we need to figure out
or that we need to do here is 4 minus

744
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,170
or that we need to do here is 4 minus
 

745
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,560
or that we need to do here is 4 minus
the number of items in hopper so we got

746
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,570
the number of items in hopper so we got
 

747
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,100
the number of items in hopper so we got
2 4 minus 2 minus the number of black

748
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,110
2 4 minus 2 minus the number of black
 

749
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,889
2 4 minus 2 minus the number of black
pegs awarded in this case we got 1 right

750
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:47,899
pegs awarded in this case we got 1 right
 

751
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,019
pegs awarded in this case we got 1 right
so 4 minus 2 minus 1 equals 1 we should

752
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:53,029
so 4 minus 2 minus 1 equals 1 we should
 

753
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,880
so 4 minus 2 minus 1 equals 1 we should
get one white peg that's how we have to

754
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:54,890
get one white peg that's how we have to
 

755
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,689
get one white peg that's how we have to
do the math so we have to incorporate

756
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:57,699
do the math so we have to incorporate
 

757
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:02,319
do the math so we have to incorporate
these pressure plays into our number of

758
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:02,329
these pressure plays into our number of
 

759
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,120
these pressure plays into our number of
items in hopper and somehow make a

760
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,130
items in hopper and somehow make a
 

761
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,980
items in hopper and somehow make a
redstone device to figure that out

762
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:05,990
redstone device to figure that out
 

763
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,449
redstone device to figure that out
that's gonna be the toughest part of

764
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:07,459
that's gonna be the toughest part of
 

765
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,789
that's gonna be the toughest part of
making this game I think cuz I I haven't

766
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:09,799
making this game I think cuz I I haven't
 

767
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,429
making this game I think cuz I I haven't
figured that out yet but wait a minute

768
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:12,439
figured that out yet but wait a minute
 

769
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,130
figured that out yet but wait a minute
Etha how are you gonna create the 4

770
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,140
Etha how are you gonna create the 4
 

771
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,220
Etha how are you gonna create the 4
colored code are you crazy

772
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,230
colored code are you crazy
 

773
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,590
colored code are you crazy
can't be done cannot be done right snow

774
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:20,600
can't be done cannot be done right snow
 

775
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,409
can't be done cannot be done right snow
obviously it can it's probably the

776
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:23,419
obviously it can it's probably the
 

777
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,179
obviously it can it's probably the
easiest part of the whole process

778
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:25,189
easiest part of the whole process
 

779
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,460
easiest part of the whole process
creating random codes in Minecraft is

780
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,470
creating random codes in Minecraft is
 

781
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,010
creating random codes in Minecraft is
nice and simple thanks to droppers we

782
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,020
nice and simple thanks to droppers we
 

783
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,530
nice and simple thanks to droppers we
only need 6 colors if we wanted to make

784
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:32,540
only need 6 colors if we wanted to make
 

785
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,330
only need 6 colors if we wanted to make
the game more difficult we can't expand

786
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:34,340
the game more difficult we can't expand
 

787
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,600
the game more difficult we can't expand
up to 9 though and whenever we hit the

788
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,610
up to 9 though and whenever we hit the
 

789
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,860
up to 9 though and whenever we hit the
button here obviously we're gonna get

random colors out of the droppers red

792
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
random colors out of the droppers red
 

793
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,710
random colors out of the droppers red
red purple yellow we need the code in

794
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
red purple yellow we need the code in
 

795
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,580
red purple yellow we need the code in
item form like the

796
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,590
item form like the
 

797
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,230
item form like the
- so that works out great we're just

798
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,240
- so that works out great we're just
 

799
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,769
- so that works out great we're just
gonna drop the items on the ice and then

800
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:50,779
gonna drop the items on the ice and then
 

801
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,220
gonna drop the items on the ice and then
run our our guesses through it alright

802
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,230
run our our guesses through it alright
 

803
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,149
run our our guesses through it alright
problem with doing it that way those

804
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:55,159
problem with doing it that way those
 

805
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,560
problem with doing it that way those
we're gonna be limited to five minutes

806
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,570
we're gonna be limited to five minutes
 

807
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,760
we're gonna be limited to five minutes
because that's how long it takes items

808
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:57,770
because that's how long it takes items
 

809
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,850
because that's how long it takes items
despawned even if you stack an item with

810
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:00,860
despawned even if you stack an item with
 

811
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,549
despawned even if you stack an item with
it it doesn't renew the Rhys or the

812
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:03,559
it it doesn't renew the Rhys or the
 

813
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,950
it it doesn't renew the Rhys or the
despawn timer so you're limited to five

814
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:05,960
despawn timer so you're limited to five
 

815
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,419
despawn timer so you're limited to five
minutes but I think we can play a game

816
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:07,429
minutes but I think we can play a game
 

817
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,690
minutes but I think we can play a game
in less than five so I'm not too too

818
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:10,700
in less than five so I'm not too too
 

819
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,930
in less than five so I'm not too too
worried about that it would be nice I

820
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:13,940
worried about that it would be nice I
 

821
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,779
worried about that it would be nice I
would love it if we had a copy of the

822
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:16,789
would love it if we had a copy of the
 

823
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,730
would love it if we had a copy of the
answer as well like habit an item form

824
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:18,740
answer as well like habit an item form
 

825
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,830
answer as well like habit an item form
hidden where we can't see it but also

826
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840
hidden where we can't see it but also
 

827
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,690
hidden where we can't see it but also
have it like at the end of our play

828
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:22,700
have it like at the end of our play
 

829
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,299
have it like at the end of our play
field here and when we guess it

830
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:25,309
field here and when we guess it
 

831
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,399
field here and when we guess it
correctly or when we run out of guesses

832
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:27,409
correctly or when we run out of guesses
 

833
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,830
correctly or when we run out of guesses
when we use all 12 of them up have it

834
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
when we use all 12 of them up have it
 

835
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,860
when we use all 12 of them up have it
drop have a piston like reveal the code

836
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:32,870
drop have a piston like reveal the code
 

837
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,330
drop have a piston like reveal the code
like in front of us that would be the

838
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,340
like in front of us that would be the
 

839
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,539
like in front of us that would be the
dream but I don't know how to do that so

840
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:37,549
dream but I don't know how to do that so
 

841
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,330
dream but I don't know how to do that so
I don't know if I'm gonna bother like we

842
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:40,340
I don't know if I'm gonna bother like we
 

843
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,180
I don't know if I'm gonna bother like we
could have a stockpile of like there's

844
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,190
could have a stockpile of like there's
 

845
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,139
could have a stockpile of like there's
no way to like I need a block or a

846
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:47,149
no way to like I need a block or a
 

847
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,909
no way to like I need a block or a
machine in Minecraft that can place

848
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:48,919
machine in Minecraft that can place
 

849
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,380
machine in Minecraft that can place
blocks it would be so nice like if we

850
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,390
blocks it would be so nice like if we
 

851
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,440
blocks it would be so nice like if we
could place the concrete powder somehow

852
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,450
could place the concrete powder somehow
 

853
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,060
could place the concrete powder somehow
would be great but we'd have to have

854
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,070
would be great but we'd have to have
 

855
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,250
would be great but we'd have to have
like a big stockpile of it somewhere and

856
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,260
like a big stockpile of it somewhere and
 

857
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,470
like a big stockpile of it somewhere and
somehow figure out what the random code

858
00:18:59,470 --> 00:18:59,480
somehow figure out what the random code
 

859
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,460
somehow figure out what the random code
is using item filters probably and then

860
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,470
is using item filters probably and then
 

861
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,690
is using item filters probably and then
like send send the colors through some

862
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:07,700
like send send the colors through some
 

863
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,460
like send send the colors through some
bubble streams or something up to the

864
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:09,470
bubble streams or something up to the
 

865
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,460
bubble streams or something up to the
area there I don't know probably won't

866
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,470
area there I don't know probably won't
 

867
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,519
area there I don't know probably won't
do it too complicated right as far as

868
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:15,529
do it too complicated right as far as
 

869
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,230
do it too complicated right as far as
inputs in the game I think we're gonna

870
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
inputs in the game I think we're gonna
 

871
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,409
inputs in the game I think we're gonna
do something like this let's grab the

872
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:20,419
do something like this let's grab the
 

873
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,289
do something like this let's grab the
colors I think we're gonna stand up here

874
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:25,299
colors I think we're gonna stand up here
 

875
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,610
colors I think we're gonna stand up here
just like this we have a nice view of

876
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:27,620
just like this we have a nice view of
 

877
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,019
just like this we have a nice view of
the play field we need to be able to see

878
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:29,029
the play field we need to be able to see
 

879
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,669
the play field we need to be able to see
our previous guesses of to make

880
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:30,679
our previous guesses of to make
 

881
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,430
our previous guesses of to make
intelligent decisions here writes so

882
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
intelligent decisions here writes so
 

883
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,139
intelligent decisions here writes so
nice and easy you got a good view of

884
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:35,149
nice and easy you got a good view of
 

885
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:40,480
nice and easy you got a good view of
everything oops yes okay so I think when

886
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,490
everything oops yes okay so I think when
 

887
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,980
everything oops yes okay so I think when
we make it yes we're gonna do it like

888
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:41,990
we make it yes we're gonna do it like
 

889
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,970
we make it yes we're gonna do it like
this it's not again it's not gonna be

890
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:45,980
this it's not again it's not gonna be
 

891
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,680
this it's not again it's not gonna be
perfectly nice but it's gonna be pretty

892
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:47,690
perfectly nice but it's gonna be pretty
 

893
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,019
perfectly nice but it's gonna be pretty
good I would say so if we wanna do

894
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:50,029
good I would say so if we wanna do
 

895
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,240
good I would say so if we wanna do
yellow yellow green red we have to place

896
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,250
yellow yellow green red we have to place
 

897
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,080
yellow yellow green red we have to place
it twice

898
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,090
it twice
 

899
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,000
it twice
which is kind of the unfortunate thing

900
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,010
which is kind of the unfortunate thing
 

901
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,529
which is kind of the unfortunate thing
about this we want the top

902
00:19:59,529 --> 00:19:59,539
about this we want the top
 

903
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,810
about this we want the top
one two go on the play field where we

904
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:01,820
one two go on the play field where we
 

905
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,899
one two go on the play field where we
can see it and reference it for later

906
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:04,909
can see it and reference it for later
 

907
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,450
can see it and reference it for later
guesses and then we'll use the bottom

908
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:07,460
guesses and then we'll use the bottom
 

909
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,759
guesses and then we'll use the bottom
one to convert into item for them all we

910
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:09,769
one to convert into item for them all we
 

911
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:14,369
one to convert into item for them all we
got to do is like what where is it

912
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:14,379
got to do is like what where is it
 

913
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,680
got to do is like what where is it
yeah dislike drop it on a slab with

914
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:17,690
yeah dislike drop it on a slab with
 

915
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,440
yeah dislike drop it on a slab with
water above when it hits the slab it'll

916
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,450
water above when it hits the slab it'll
 

917
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,239
water above when it hits the slab it'll
break it into the item so if you have we

918
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:25,249
break it into the item so if you have we
 

919
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:28,440
break it into the item so if you have we
have any slabs we got no slabs guys I

920
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,450
have any slabs we got no slabs guys I
 

921
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,909
have any slabs we got no slabs guys I
break the crafting table oh I did it's

922
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:30,919
break the crafting table oh I did it's
 

923
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:38,379
break the crafting table oh I did it's
about despawn no got it just in time I'm

924
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:38,389
about despawn no got it just in time I'm
 

925
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:39,279
about despawn no got it just in time I'm
sure you know what I'm talking about

926
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:39,289
sure you know what I'm talking about
 

927
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,749
sure you know what I'm talking about
though if we drop concrete powder on a

928
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:43,759
though if we drop concrete powder on a
 

929
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,049
though if we drop concrete powder on a
slab or a sign or something ban it

930
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:47,059
slab or a sign or something ban it
 

931
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,519
slab or a sign or something ban it
breaks into item form and if there's

932
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:48,529
breaks into item form and if there's
 

933
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,379
breaks into item form and if there's
water above that it'll it'll push it on

934
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:50,389
water above that it'll it'll push it on
 

935
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,599
water above that it'll it'll push it on
the ice so that's how we're gonna do

936
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:52,609
the ice so that's how we're gonna do
 

937
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,489
the ice so that's how we're gonna do
that the only problem is we want to keep

938
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:54,499
that the only problem is we want to keep
 

939
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,009
that the only problem is we want to keep
the answers all nice and condensed like

940
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:57,019
the answers all nice and condensed like
 

941
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,619
the answers all nice and condensed like
this is possible and I think there's no

942
00:20:59,619 --> 00:20:59,629
this is possible and I think there's no
 

943
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:03,999
this is possible and I think there's no
way well let's let's press this to see

944
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:04,009
way well let's let's press this to see
 

945
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,729
way well let's let's press this to see
what happens I think the items are gonna

946
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:06,739
what happens I think the items are gonna
 

947
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:11,499
what happens I think the items are gonna
bounce pretty far though so that'll one

948
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:11,509
bounce pretty far though so that'll one
 

949
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,029
bounce pretty far though so that'll one
one set goes on the play field the other

950
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
one set goes on the play field the other
 

951
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,009
one set goes on the play field the other
set falls through and it ends up at the

952
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:18,019
set falls through and it ends up at the
 

953
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,649
set falls through and it ends up at the
ends here yeah you see like two of them

954
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:20,659
ends here yeah you see like two of them
 

955
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,680
ends here yeah you see like two of them
went to that side one there none there

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,690
went to that side one there none there
 

957
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,989
went to that side one there none there
one there so we gotta keep them separate

958
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:25,999
one there so we gotta keep them separate
 

959
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,539
one there so we gotta keep them separate
somehow keep them from stacking together

use the same redstone contraptions

982
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:54,649
use the same redstone contraptions
 

983
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,409
use the same redstone contraptions
there's maybe 20 or 30 different ones

984
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:56,419
there's maybe 20 or 30 different ones
 

985
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,810
there's maybe 20 or 30 different ones
you hop you got hopper clock so you got

986
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:58,820
you hop you got hopper clock so you got
 

987
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,969

00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:00,979
RS nor latch is monostable circuits you
 

989
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,950
RS nor latch is monostable circuits you
just kind of combine the the pieces

990
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
just kind of combine the the pieces
 

991
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,839
just kind of combine the the pieces
together in different ways and you end

992
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:04,849
together in different ways and you end
 

993
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,489
together in different ways and you end
up with the unique farm which is it's

stuff right but when you do a weird

998
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:10,549
stuff right but when you do a weird

obscure project like this Oh

1000
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,040
obscure project like this Oh
 

1001
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,300
obscure project like this Oh
and you gotta really think you got a

1002
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,310
and you gotta really think you got a
 

1003
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,540
and you gotta really think you got a
design new obscure redstone project so

1004
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,550
design new obscure redstone project so
 

1005
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,960
design new obscure redstone project so
you would never use anywhere else so for

1006
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:22,970
you would never use anywhere else so for
 

1007
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,560
you would never use anywhere else so for
this we need to take like four concrete

1008
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,570
this we need to take like four concrete
 

1009
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,570
this we need to take like four concrete
powder like this and split it up a bit

1010
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:28,580
powder like this and split it up a bit
 

1011
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,060
powder like this and split it up a bit
so that each one gets its own separate

1012
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,070
so that each one gets its own separate
 

1013
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,410
so that each one gets its own separate
Lane and they don't merge together so we

1014
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:35,420
Lane and they don't merge together so we
 

1015
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,750
Lane and they don't merge together so we
had to make us splitter over here so

1016
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
had to make us splitter over here so
 

1017
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,150
had to make us splitter over here so
check this out so let me grab more more

1018
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,160
check this out so let me grab more more
 

1019
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,300
check this out so let me grab more more
powder actually get a little bit more so

1020
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,310
powder actually get a little bit more so
 

1021
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,730
powder actually get a little bit more so
it's gonna work like this go down oh I

1022
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:45,740
it's gonna work like this go down oh I
 

1023
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,930
it's gonna work like this go down oh I
fell inside its where do we want to go

1024
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:49,940
fell inside its where do we want to go
 

1025
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,880
fell inside its where do we want to go
that's the top of it I'm lost where's my

1026
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:54,890
that's the top of it I'm lost where's my
 

1027
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,880
that's the top of it I'm lost where's my
way down over here yeah so this is our

1028
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:57,890
way down over here yeah so this is our
 

1029
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,200
way down over here yeah so this is our
our separator so basically I wanted to

1030
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,210
our separator so basically I wanted to
 

1031
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,120
our separator so basically I wanted to
make sure we don't put anything under

1032
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,130
make sure we don't put anything under
 

1033
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,910
make sure we don't put anything under
the playfield here too in case we set up

1034
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:06,920
the playfield here too in case we set up
 

1035
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,680
the playfield here too in case we set up
something that removes the blocks

1036
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:08,690
something that removes the blocks
 

1037
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,780
something that removes the blocks
underneath and all the concrete powder

1038
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:10,790
underneath and all the concrete powder
 

1039
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,180
underneath and all the concrete powder
falls down and goes into a hopper at the

1040
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,190
falls down and goes into a hopper at the
 

1041
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,330
falls down and goes into a hopper at the
end of a game would be nice that way

1042
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,340
end of a game would be nice that way
 

1043
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,180
end of a game would be nice that way
we're gonna have to remove it manually

1044
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,190
we're gonna have to remove it manually
 

1045
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,470
we're gonna have to remove it manually
so I'm trying not to put anything over

1046
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
so I'm trying not to put anything over
 

1047
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,260
so I'm trying not to put anything over
here this direction so I had to pull the

1048
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,270
here this direction so I had to pull the
 

1049
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,640
here this direction so I had to pull the
powder like it falls down right here we

1050
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:30,650
powder like it falls down right here we
 

1051
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,860
powder like it falls down right here we
activate this once you see the sticky

1052
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:32,870
activate this once you see the sticky
 

1053
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,860
activate this once you see the sticky
pistons I'll extend it pulls it back

1054
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:35,870
pistons I'll extend it pulls it back
 

1055
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,660
pistons I'll extend it pulls it back
this one retracts first and then this

1056
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:37,670
this one retracts first and then this
 

1057
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,880
this one retracts first and then this
one we got a two tick delay right so

1058
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:39,890
one we got a two tick delay right so
 

1059
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,270
one we got a two tick delay right so
some of it goes sideways here like that

1060
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
some of it goes sideways here like that
 

1061
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,190
some of it goes sideways here like that
so one of them fell down here onto the

1062
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
so one of them fell down here onto the
 

1063
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,260
so one of them fell down here onto the
slab and broke into an item form the

1064
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,270
slab and broke into an item form the
 

1065
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,080
slab and broke into an item form the
other three are still here we do that

1066
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,090
other three are still here we do that
 

1067
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,540
other three are still here we do that
again there's more Pistons there's like

1068
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:55,550
again there's more Pistons there's like
 

1069
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,570
again there's more Pistons there's like
two over there I think this one attracts

1070
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:58,580
two over there I think this one attracts
 

1071
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,330
two over there I think this one attracts
first and then this one and it falls

1072
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,340
first and then this one and it falls
 

1073
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,280
first and then this one and it falls
down that hole so we split it

1074
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,290
down that hole so we split it
 

1075
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,200
down that hole so we split it
we got one falling down there one down

1076
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,210
we got one falling down there one down
 

1077
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,910
we got one falling down there one down
there one there and there we got a one

1078
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:06,920
there one there and there we got a one
 

1079
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,670
there one there and there we got a one
block gap between all of them and you

1080
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:09,680
block gap between all of them and you
 

1081
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,620
block gap between all of them and you
can see we got them waiting here for us

1082
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,630
can see we got them waiting here for us
 

1083
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,260
can see we got them waiting here for us
I decided to put in some trapdoors

1084
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,270
I decided to put in some trapdoors
 

1085
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,090
I decided to put in some trapdoors
so that they all line up and when we

1086
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,100
so that they all line up and when we
 

1087
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,520
so that they all line up and when we
release them they're all perfectly in

1088
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,530
release them they're all perfectly in
 

1089
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,800
release them they're all perfectly in
sync with each other so we keep them

1090
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:20,810
sync with each other so we keep them
 

1091
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,140
sync with each other so we keep them
suspended in water so that when they the

1092
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,150
suspended in water so that when they the
 

1093
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,919
suspended in water so that when they the
trapdoor opens they they move

1094
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:25,929
trapdoor opens they they move
 

1095
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,720
trapdoor opens they they move
and then we got another water scream in

1096
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,730
and then we got another water scream in
 

1097
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,549
and then we got another water scream in
front so they can pick up some speed and

1098
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:29,559
front so they can pick up some speed and
 

1099
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,940
front so they can pick up some speed and
cross the ice here for that calculation

1100
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:32,950
cross the ice here for that calculation
 

1101
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,590
cross the ice here for that calculation
we need to do they all hit the pressure

1102
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:34,600
we need to do they all hit the pressure
 

1103
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,180
we need to do they all hit the pressure
plate at the same time and then we have

1104
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,190
plate at the same time and then we have
 

1105
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,680
plate at the same time and then we have
to run them through that way too

1106
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:40,690
to run them through that way too
 

1107
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,330
to run them through that way too
to figure out the white peg so the first

1108
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:42,340
to figure out the white peg so the first
 

1109
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,280
to figure out the white peg so the first
pass is for figuring out how many black

1110
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,290
pass is for figuring out how many black
 

1111
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,010
pass is for figuring out how many black
pegs we need to dish out and then the

1112
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,020
pegs we need to dish out and then the
 

1113
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,210
pegs we need to dish out and then the
second pass is for the white pegs all

1114
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:51,220
second pass is for the white pegs all
 

1115
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,260
second pass is for the white pegs all
right that's kind of cool

1116
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,270
right that's kind of cool
 

1117
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,940
right that's kind of cool
such a weird thing to make but it's it's

1118
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:56,950
such a weird thing to make but it's it's
 

1119
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,150
such a weird thing to make but it's it's
really cool so for the trapdoors I just

1120
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,160
really cool so for the trapdoors I just
 

1121
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,510
really cool so for the trapdoors I just
put we have a torch up here red stone

1122
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
put we have a torch up here red stone
 

1123
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
put we have a torch up here red stone
running above them they open downward

1124
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:06,970
running above them they open downward
 

1125
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,210
running above them they open downward
actually because items float on water

1126
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,220
actually because items float on water
 

1127
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,270
actually because items float on water
I had them opening the other way before

1128
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,280
I had them opening the other way before
 

1129
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,210
I had them opening the other way before
like I had them aligned at the top and

1130
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,220
like I had them aligned at the top and
 

1131
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,580
like I had them aligned at the top and
the items were getting kind of stuck on

1132
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:17,590
the items were getting kind of stuck on
 

1133
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,100
the items were getting kind of stuck on
that so we have them opening downward

1134
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,110
that so we have them opening downward
 

1135
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,750
that so we have them opening downward
instead so the item doesn't get caught

1136
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
instead so the item doesn't get caught
 

1137
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,940
instead so the item doesn't get caught
on them and initially I was kind of like

1138
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:23,950
on them and initially I was kind of like
 

1139
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,430
on them and initially I was kind of like
is that actually gonna work yeah yeah

1140
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,440
is that actually gonna work yeah yeah
 

1141
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,970
is that actually gonna work yeah yeah
you know it will because if you have ice

1142
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:29,980
you know it will because if you have ice
 

1143
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,130
you know it will because if you have ice
under the trapdoor it still retains the

1144
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,140
under the trapdoor it still retains the
 

1145
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,430
under the trapdoor it still retains the
slippery effect on the trapdoor while if

1146
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
slippery effect on the trapdoor while if
 

1147
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,610
slippery effect on the trapdoor while if
you don't it just kind of it gets

1148
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:38,620
you don't it just kind of it gets
 

1149
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,740
you don't it just kind of it gets
stalled out right because items gonna

1150
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:40,750
stalled out right because items gonna
 

1151
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,480
stalled out right because items gonna
fall off the water stream there and kind

1152
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,490
fall off the water stream there and kind
 

1153
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,130
fall off the water stream there and kind
of land on the trapdoor but it slides

1154
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,140
of land on the trapdoor but it slides
 

1155
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,810
of land on the trapdoor but it slides
just enough that it gets another water

1156
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:45,820
just enough that it gets another water
 

1157
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,010
just enough that it gets another water
stream so that's all good

1158
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,020
stream so that's all good
 

1159
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,490
stream so that's all good
so I guess our thing for generating the

1160
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:53,500
so I guess our thing for generating the
 

1161
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,919
so I guess our thing for generating the
code is gonna we want them to land right

1162
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:55,929
code is gonna we want them to land right
 

1163
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,039
code is gonna we want them to land right
here here here and here at the cross

1164
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,049
here here here and here at the cross
 

1165
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,030
here here here and here at the cross
sections so we'll probably just set the

1166
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,040
sections so we'll probably just set the
 

1167
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,350
sections so we'll probably just set the
right spot no we gotta go forward one

1168
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,360
right spot no we gotta go forward one
 

1169
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,100
right spot no we gotta go forward one
more probably have our droppers with the

1170
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,110
more probably have our droppers with the
 

1171
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,310
more probably have our droppers with the
random colors in don't I put in the

1172
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,320
random colors in don't I put in the
 

1173
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,470
random colors in don't I put in the
wrong place again right over here before

1174
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
wrong place again right over here before
 

1175
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
wrong place again right over here before
the match starts we just have to

1176
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:17,890
the match starts we just have to
 

1177
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,950
the match starts we just have to
activate these once and then we got that

1178
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:19,960
activate these once and then we got that
 

1179
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,220
activate these once and then we got that
five minutes to finish the game unless

1180
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,230
five minutes to finish the game unless
 

1181
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,870
five minutes to finish the game unless
we want to create a device step to

1182
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
we want to create a device step to
 

1183
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,700
we want to create a device step to
update them so that they don't do spawn

1184
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:26,710
update them so that they don't do spawn
 

1185
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,500
update them so that they don't do spawn
but I don't know if that's gonna be

1186
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:28,510
but I don't know if that's gonna be
 

1187
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,610
but I don't know if that's gonna be
necessary it's gonna add more

1188
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:29,620
necessary it's gonna add more
 

1189
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,580
necessary it's gonna add more
computation to the thing and we probably

1190
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:32,590
computation to the thing and we probably
 

1191
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,880
computation to the thing and we probably
just need to do it like this so the item

1192
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:35,890
just need to do it like this so the item
 

1193
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,140
just need to do it like this so the item
will shoot out it'll hit the wall here

1194
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,150
will shoot out it'll hit the wall here
 

1195
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,610
will shoot out it'll hit the wall here
and then fall down

1196
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:38,620
and then fall down
 

1197
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,930
and then fall down
uh-huh all right guys well we got a

1198
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:40,940
uh-huh all right guys well we got a
 

1199
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,490
uh-huh all right guys well we got a
pretty good start on this here today I

1200
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:42,500
pretty good start on this here today I
 

1201
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,630
pretty good start on this here today I
got a little bit more done here I'll

1202
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:43,640
got a little bit more done here I'll
 

1203
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,169
got a little bit more done here I'll
show you

1204
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:44,179
show you
 

1205
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,140
show you
but I just try to mock up we got to find

1206
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,150
but I just try to mock up we got to find
 

1207
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,090
but I just try to mock up we got to find
some way of displaying the black and

1208
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:49,100
some way of displaying the black and
 

1209
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,510
some way of displaying the black and
white pegs as well on our field here I

1210
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
white pegs as well on our field here I
 

1211
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,030
white pegs as well on our field here I
tried like doing it vertically and

1212
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,040
tried like doing it vertically and
 

1213
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,730
tried like doing it vertically and
having them in block form so for example

1214
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:57,740
having them in block form so for example
 

1215
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,909
having them in block form so for example
if for this guess here we would have one

1216
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:00,919
if for this guess here we would have one
 

1217
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,810
if for this guess here we would have one
one black peg and three white ones maybe

1218
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:04,820
one black peg and three white ones maybe
 

1219
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,180
one black peg and three white ones maybe
maybe the way we'll do it but this has a

1220
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,190
maybe the way we'll do it but this has a
 

1221
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,580
maybe the way we'll do it but this has a
few problems kind of hoping you guys

1222
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:09,590
few problems kind of hoping you guys
 

1223
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,549
few problems kind of hoping you guys
have some brilliant solution that you'll

1224
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
have some brilliant solution that you'll
 

1225
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,110
have some brilliant solution that you'll
post in the comments and I'll just steal

1226
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,120
post in the comments and I'll just steal
 

1227
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,630
post in the comments and I'll just steal
it because I I think this is gonna have

1228
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
it because I I think this is gonna have
 

1229
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,630
it because I I think this is gonna have
a few issues we have to have some kind

1230
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:19,640
a few issues we have to have some kind
 

1231
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,789
a few issues we have to have some kind
of filler material between the pegs as

1232
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:21,799
of filler material between the pegs as
 

1233
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,640
of filler material between the pegs as
well because if this is all empty space

1234
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,650
well because if this is all empty space
 

1235
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,230
well because if this is all empty space
like where the orange sand is then we

1236
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
like where the orange sand is then we
 

1237
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,900
like where the orange sand is then we
can't push it with pistons and we need

1238
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:28,910
can't push it with pistons and we need
 

1239
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,909
can't push it with pistons and we need
that this all to line up perfectly with

1240
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:30,919
that this all to line up perfectly with
 

1241
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,870
that this all to line up perfectly with
our guests so that's kind of an issue am

1242
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
our guests so that's kind of an issue am
 

1243
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,360
our guests so that's kind of an issue am
I gonna be able to sleep oh I can

1244
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,370
I gonna be able to sleep oh I can
 

1245
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,190
I gonna be able to sleep oh I can
there's been a zombie in a cave nearby

1246
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
there's been a zombie in a cave nearby
 

1247
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,130
there's been a zombie in a cave nearby
for this whole episode and he's been

1248
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,140
for this whole episode and he's been
 

1249
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,080
for this whole episode and he's been
driving me nuts

1250
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,090
driving me nuts
 

1251
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,299
driving me nuts
okay anyways I got some more of the

1252
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:46,309
okay anyways I got some more of the
 

1253
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:47,980
okay anyways I got some more of the
system hooked up to what we figured out

1254
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:47,990
system hooked up to what we figured out
 

1255
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,390
system hooked up to what we figured out
before so there's gonna be a tripwire

1256
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:49,400
before so there's gonna be a tripwire
 

1257
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,760
before so there's gonna be a tripwire
above us I think pair a few of them so

1258
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:51,770
above us I think pair a few of them so
 

1259
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,980
above us I think pair a few of them so
that after we enter our guess basically

1260
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:56,990
that after we enter our guess basically
 

1261
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,080
that after we enter our guess basically
we have to jump then to officially put

1262
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,090
we have to jump then to officially put
 

1263
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,700
we have to jump then to officially put
it in

1264
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:00,710
it in
 

1265
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,210
it in
the bottom layer of the concrete powder

1266
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,220
the bottom layer of the concrete powder
 

1267
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,190
the bottom layer of the concrete powder
falls down below to our separator and to

1268
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,200
falls down below to our separator and to
 

1269
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,460
falls down below to our separator and to
our water and ice system top layer goes

1270
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:09,470
our water and ice system top layer goes
 

1271
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,409
our water and ice system top layer goes
onto the field so we can see it and

1272
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:11,419
onto the field so we can see it and
 

1273
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,869
onto the field so we can see it and
probably like five or ten seconds after

1274
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:13,879
probably like five or ten seconds after
 

1275
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:18,369
probably like five or ten seconds after
we we jump here then maybe the sides

1276
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:18,379
we we jump here then maybe the sides
 

1277
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,289
we we jump here then maybe the sides
will update with the black and white

1278
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:20,299
will update with the black and white
 

1279
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,330
will update with the black and white
pegs for our guess that we just entered

1280
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:22,340
pegs for our guess that we just entered
 

1281
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,039
pegs for our guess that we just entered
in after does the calculations but

1282
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,049
in after does the calculations but
 

1283
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,019
in after does the calculations but
anyways from the tripwire here we got

1284
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:29,029
anyways from the tripwire here we got
 

1285
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,539
anyways from the tripwire here we got
its we got to go into our Pistons piston

1286
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:31,549
its we got to go into our Pistons piston
 

1287
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:32,669
its we got to go into our Pistons piston
system over there

1288
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:32,679
system over there
 

1289
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,060
system over there
it also branches down to our separator

1290
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,070
it also branches down to our separator
 

1291
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,249
it also branches down to our separator
remember we had to send this thing to

1292
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:39,259
remember we had to send this thing to
 

1293
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,919
remember we had to send this thing to
pulses so it goes to a monostable

1294
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:41,929
pulses so it goes to a monostable
 

1295
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:47,769
pulses so it goes to a monostable
circuit here and we do a split here so

1296
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:47,779
circuit here and we do a split here so
 

1297
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,499
circuit here and we do a split here so
on this redstone path has very short

1298
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:50,509
on this redstone path has very short
 

1299
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,080
on this redstone path has very short
delay it gives time for the wire to turn

1300
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,090
delay it gives time for the wire to turn
 

1301
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,440
delay it gives time for the wire to turn
on and off and then after six ticks it

1302
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,450
on and off and then after six ticks it
 

1303
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,999
on and off and then after six ticks it
goes on and off again so there's two

1304
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:58,009
goes on and off again so there's two
 

1305
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,999
goes on and off again so there's two
pulses to our separator we also branch

1306
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:01,009
pulses to our separator we also branch
 

1307
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,889
pulses to our separator we also branch
off here then and it goes down to our

1308
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:02,899
off here then and it goes down to our
 

1309
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,810
off here then and it goes down to our
trapdoor system so everything gets

1310
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:04,820
trapdoor system so everything gets
 

1311
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,730
trapdoor system so everything gets
synced up all nice and it goes through

1312
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:09,740
synced up all nice and it goes through
 

1313
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,720
synced up all nice and it goes through
our ice calculator let's see if we can

1314
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:13,730
our ice calculator let's see if we can
 

1315
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,720
our ice calculator let's see if we can
catch it in action here and then we got

1316
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:16,730
catch it in action here and then we got
 

1317
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,399
catch it in action here and then we got
one more problem I just discovered I'll

1318
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:18,409
one more problem I just discovered I'll
 

1319
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:20,950
one more problem I just discovered I'll
show you that - it's not a big problem

1320
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
show you that - it's not a big problem
 

1321
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,739
show you that - it's not a big problem
but it's it's a problem okay so we enter

1322
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:23,749
but it's it's a problem okay so we enter
 

1323
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,060
but it's it's a problem okay so we enter
our guess we're gonna run downstairs

1324
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,070
our guess we're gonna run downstairs
 

1325
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,140
our guess we're gonna run downstairs
real quick

1326
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,150

 

1327
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,100

see it here use the separator trapdoors

1328
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,110
see it here use the separator trapdoors
 

1329
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:38,040
see it here use the separator trapdoors
just opens uh-huh

1330
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,050
just opens uh-huh
 

1331
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,450
just opens uh-huh
so I guess with this thing watch this we

1332
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:42,460
so I guess with this thing watch this we
 

1333
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,000
so I guess with this thing watch this we
have to like have the items in a dead

1334
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,010
have to like have the items in a dead
 

1335
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,500
have to like have the items in a dead
stop before it lands on the ice

1336
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:46,510
stop before it lands on the ice
 

1337
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,430
stop before it lands on the ice
otherwise look what happens here okay

1338
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:50,440
otherwise look what happens here okay
 

1339
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,170
otherwise look what happens here okay
that one wasn't too bad sometimes they

1340
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,180
that one wasn't too bad sometimes they
 

1341
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,960
that one wasn't too bad sometimes they
really slide around though and they'll

1342
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:54,970
really slide around though and they'll
 

1343
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,410
really slide around though and they'll
actually slide out of their Lane you see

1344
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:58,420
actually slide out of their Lane you see
 

1345
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,910
actually slide out of their Lane you see
these are kind of on the edge but

1346
00:29:59,910 --> 00:29:59,920
these are kind of on the edge but
 

1347
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,300
these are kind of on the edge but
they're okay I realized I can put some

1348
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,310
they're okay I realized I can put some
 

1349
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,710
they're okay I realized I can put some
end end rods like in the block that the

1350
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:07,720
end end rods like in the block that the
 

1351
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,200
end end rods like in the block that the
dropper shoots into that helps to keep

1352
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,210
dropper shoots into that helps to keep
 

1353
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,430
dropper shoots into that helps to keep
it more in the center but you see they

1354
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,440
it more in the center but you see they
 

1355
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,290
it more in the center but you see they
kind of slide after they hit the ice if

1356
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,300
kind of slide after they hit the ice if
 

1357
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,850
kind of slide after they hit the ice if
they have a little bit of momentum look

1358
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:17,860
they have a little bit of momentum look
 

1359
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,890
they have a little bit of momentum look
how far out it's supposed to land here

1360
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:19,900
how far out it's supposed to land here
 

1361
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,390
how far out it's supposed to land here
and it went all the way over to here so

1362
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,400
and it went all the way over to here so
 

1363
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,730
and it went all the way over to here so
we have to not just drop it on the ice

1364
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:23,740
we have to not just drop it on the ice
 

1365
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,890
we have to not just drop it on the ice
we have to totally stop it before we

1366
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:25,900
we have to totally stop it before we
 

1367
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,460
we have to totally stop it before we
drop it that's not hard to do we just

1368
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,470
drop it that's not hard to do we just
 

1369
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,260
drop it that's not hard to do we just
have to set up a water stream for each

1370
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,270
have to set up a water stream for each
 

1371
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,680
have to set up a water stream for each
of those anyways it's a good start to

1372
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:34,690
of those anyways it's a good start to
 

1373
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,300
of those anyways it's a good start to
this if you guys got any ideas or

1374
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,310
this if you guys got any ideas or
 

1375
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,710
this if you guys got any ideas or
feedback on it please let me know in the

1376
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:37,720
feedback on it please let me know in the
 

1377
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,920
feedback on it please let me know in the
comments and I'll try to try to

1378
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:40,930
comments and I'll try to try to
 

1379
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,750
comments and I'll try to try to
incorporate them into the build if

1380
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:42,760
incorporate them into the build if
 

1381
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,960
incorporate them into the build if
they're good but anyways guys we're

1382
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:45,970
they're good but anyways guys we're
 

1383
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,000
they're good but anyways guys we're
gonna get to the comment of the day and

1384
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,010
gonna get to the comment of the day and
 

1385
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,610
gonna get to the comment of the day and
it's gonna be fun because last episode I

1386
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:50,620
it's gonna be fun because last episode I
 

1387
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,500
it's gonna be fun because last episode I
asked you what's the weirdest thing

1388
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:52,510
asked you what's the weirdest thing
 

1389
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,410
asked you what's the weirdest thing
you've seen someone do in public if you

1390
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:55,420
you've seen someone do in public if you
 

1391
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,760
you've seen someone do in public if you
didn't read the comments of the last

1392
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,770
didn't read the comments of the last
 

1393
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,380
didn't read the comments of the last
episode there was some really really

1394
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,390
episode there was some really really
 

1395
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,060
episode there was some really really
weird funny stuff lots of gross stuff

1396
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,070
weird funny stuff lots of gross stuff
 

1397
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,380
weird funny stuff lots of gross stuff
too obviously but yeah somebody like for

pour a bowl of cereal and he put the

1402
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
pour a bowl of cereal and he put the
 

1403
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,090
pour a bowl of cereal and he put the
milk in the bowl before he poured the

1404
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,100
milk in the bowl before he poured the
 

1405
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,930
milk in the bowl before he poured the
cereal there is some messed up sickos in

1406
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:15,940
cereal there is some messed up sickos in
 

1407
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,000
cereal there is some messed up sickos in
this world I tell you what that is one

1408
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,010
this world I tell you what that is one
 

1409
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,500
this world I tell you what that is one
of the weirdest things I've ever heard I

1410

of the weirdest things I've ever heard I
 

1411
