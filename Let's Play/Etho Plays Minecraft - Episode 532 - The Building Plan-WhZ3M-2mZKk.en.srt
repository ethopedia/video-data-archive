before
 

123
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,270
before
it's gonna be a bit of a weird building

124
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,280
it's gonna be a bit of a weird building
 

125
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,380
it's gonna be a bit of a weird building
though is my problem like it's not like

126
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,390
though is my problem like it's not like
 

127
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,880

here right it's like a weird shape and
 

131
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,720
here right it's like a weird shape and
everything so this should be interesting

132
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,730
everything so this should be interesting
 

133
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,040
everything so this should be interesting
it might look a little strange at the

134
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,050
it might look a little strange at the
 

135
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,380
it might look a little strange at the
end of things but we'll see how it goes

136
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,390
end of things but we'll see how it goes

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:02,520
this great concrete a little bit more
 

141
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,100
this great concrete a little bit more
than the cyan clay we were using

142
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,110
than the cyan clay we were using
 

143
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,720
than the cyan clay we were using
originally for this build so we're gonna

144
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:05,730
originally for this build so we're gonna
 

145
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,320
originally for this build so we're gonna
change that all outs our goal is to kind

146
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,330
change that all outs our goal is to kind
 

147
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,790
change that all outs our goal is to kind
of make a weird futuristic feel with

148
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:13,800
of make a weird futuristic feel with
 

149
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,910
of make a weird futuristic feel with
this build all right that's our style

150
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
this build all right that's our style
 

151
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,100
this build all right that's our style
we're going for a little bit of a

152
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,110
we're going for a little bit of a
 

153
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,240
we're going for a little bit of a
problem though because we have like a

154
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,250
problem though because we have like a
 

155
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,390
problem though because we have like a
almost a natural color scheme over there

156
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
almost a natural color scheme over there
 

157
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,710
almost a natural color scheme over there
and then we have another color scheme

158
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
and then we have another color scheme
 

159
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,140
and then we have another color scheme
over there so this area might look a

160
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,150
over there so this area might look a
 

161
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,640
over there so this area might look a
little weird it's gonna be hard to blend

162
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,650
little weird it's gonna be hard to blend
 

163
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,110
little weird it's gonna be hard to blend
them together having these three

164
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,120
them together having these three
 

165
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,600
them together having these three
completely different builds side-by-side

166
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,610
completely different builds side-by-side
 

167
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,730
completely different builds side-by-side
I maybe didn't plan that out the best

168
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:34,740
I maybe didn't plan that out the best
 

169
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,970
I maybe didn't plan that out the best
but we'll see what we can do with it

170
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:37,980
but we'll see what we can do with it
 

171
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,010
but we'll see what we can do with it
yeah I'm definitely liking the gray

172
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,020
yeah I'm definitely liking the gray
 

173
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,990
yeah I'm definitely liking the gray
concrete over the cyan clay so we'll

174
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
concrete over the cyan clay so we'll
 

175
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,960
concrete over the cyan clay so we'll
stick with that let's let's do this

176
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:44,970
stick with that let's let's do this
 

177
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,760
stick with that let's let's do this
entrance area so I don't think we're

178
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:46,770
entrance area so I don't think we're
 

179
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,460
entrance area so I don't think we're
gonna actually put a door on this thing

180
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,470
gonna actually put a door on this thing
 

181
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,450
gonna actually put a door on this thing
because again it's not like a normal

182
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:50,460
because again it's not like a normal
 

183
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,860
because again it's not like a normal
building right it's kind of a weird

184
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:51,870
building right it's kind of a weird
 

185
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,220
building right it's kind of a weird
building um and when we go to use it a

186
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,230
building um and when we go to use it a
 

187
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,930
building um and when we go to use it a
lot of times I'm I want to just fly in

188
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:56,940
lot of times I'm I want to just fly in
 

189
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,490
lot of times I'm I want to just fly in
grab something and fly it out right I

190
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
grab something and fly it out right I
 

191
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,840
grab something and fly it out right I
don't want to go through a big corridor

192
00:03:59,840 --> 00:03:59,850
don't want to go through a big corridor
 

193
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,450
don't want to go through a big corridor
of doors to get to the buttons here you

194
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:02,460
of doors to get to the buttons here you
 

195
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,640
of doors to get to the buttons here you
know so I think we'll just keep it like

196
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:04,650
know so I think we'll just keep it like
 

197
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,020
know so I think we'll just keep it like
this this is a good angle to view it

198
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,030
this this is a good angle to view it
 

199
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,850
this this is a good angle to view it
from I feel so we'll have like a landing

200
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:07,860
from I feel so we'll have like a landing
 

201
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,230
from I feel so we'll have like a landing
area here but we're gonna get rid of

202
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,240
area here but we're gonna get rid of
 

203
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,320
area here but we're gonna get rid of
this play for sure this we will probably

204
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,330
this play for sure this we will probably
 

205
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,960
this play for sure this we will probably
change to the gray as well keep it

206
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:14,970
change to the gray as well keep it
 

207
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,510
change to the gray as well keep it
consistent and then we'll probably just

208
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:17,520
consistent and then we'll probably just
 

209
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,890
consistent and then we'll probably just
put the prismarine like in the middle

210
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:18,900
put the prismarine like in the middle
 

211
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,680
put the prismarine like in the middle
here

212
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,690

 

213
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:31,730

I hate when I do that I middle-click

214
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:31,740
I hate when I do that I middle-click
 

215
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,470
I hate when I do that I middle-click
sometimes and it doesn't select the

216
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:33,480
sometimes and it doesn't select the
 

217
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,200
sometimes and it doesn't select the
block and I like Scrolls instead and I

218
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,210
block and I like Scrolls instead and I
 

219
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,050
block and I like Scrolls instead and I
go to like the ender pearl I do that's

220
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,060
go to like the ender pearl I do that's
 

221
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,670
go to like the ender pearl I do that's
so often I don't know why okay let's go

222
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
so often I don't know why okay let's go
 

223
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,810
so often I don't know why okay let's go
around the sea lantern

224
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,820
around the sea lantern
 

225
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,720
around the sea lantern
I'll give it a weird shape yeah that

226
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:50,730
I'll give it a weird shape yeah that
 

227
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,270
I'll give it a weird shape yeah that
looks a little strange doesn't it so I

228
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
looks a little strange doesn't it so I
 

229
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,650
looks a little strange doesn't it so I
think we either got to change it to bone

230
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,660
think we either got to change it to bone
 

231
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,300
think we either got to change it to bone
blocks or we have to make more of the

232
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,310
blocks or we have to make more of the
 

233
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,600
blocks or we have to make more of the
outside of this building that's darker

234
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,610
outside of this building that's darker
 

235
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,730
outside of this building that's darker
color cuz it just looks like it stands

236
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:01,740
color cuz it just looks like it stands
 

237
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,399
color cuz it just looks like it stands
out on its own right now

238
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,409
out on its own right now
 

239
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,109
out on its own right now
which wouldn't be a bad thing actually

240
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:06,119
which wouldn't be a bad thing actually
 

241
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,449
which wouldn't be a bad thing actually
cuz we only got two colors really in our

242
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:08,459
cuz we only got two colors really in our
 

243
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,729
cuz we only got two colors really in our
our outside here just the white and the

244
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:10,739
our outside here just the white and the
 

245
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,649
our outside here just the white and the
blue if we mix some black in with that

246
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:12,659
blue if we mix some black in with that
 

247
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,570
blue if we mix some black in with that
it could look cool not black it's great

248
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,580
it could look cool not black it's great
 

249
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,559
it could look cool not black it's great
don't don't mix those up okay um over

250
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:20,569
don't don't mix those up okay um over
 

251
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,829
don't don't mix those up okay um over
here and we probably will bring this

252
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:24,839
here and we probably will bring this
 

253
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:31,820
here and we probably will bring this
over let's see oh I wonder if my middle

254
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:31,830
over let's see oh I wonder if my middle
 

255
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,219
over let's see oh I wonder if my middle
click is kind of open right now I just I

256
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:34,229
click is kind of open right now I just I
 

257
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,109
click is kind of open right now I just I
just got this mouse though it shouldn't

258
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:36,119
just got this mouse though it shouldn't
 

259
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,359
just got this mouse though it shouldn't
be so I'll probably do prisoner in here

260
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,369
be so I'll probably do prisoner in here
 

261
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:45,139
be so I'll probably do prisoner in here
as well all along the ground right we

262
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,149
as well all along the ground right we
 

263
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,549
as well all along the ground right we
somehow have to add some staircases like

264
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:49,559
somehow have to add some staircases like
 

265
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,109
somehow have to add some staircases like
to go down and to go up here and the

266
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:51,119
to go down and to go up here and the
 

267
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,149
to go down and to go up here and the
problem is we kind of want in the middle

268
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:53,159
problem is we kind of want in the middle
 

269
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,509
problem is we kind of want in the middle
for both and that's not possible we also

270
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:56,519
for both and that's not possible we also
 

271
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,459
for both and that's not possible we also
have a wire that comes across here that

272
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:58,469
have a wire that comes across here that
 

273
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,609
have a wire that comes across here that
we have to deal with somehow and we also

274
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:01,619
we have to deal with somehow and we also
 

275
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,139
we have to deal with somehow and we also
need to figure out what goes on this

276
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:03,149
need to figure out what goes on this
 

277
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,019
need to figure out what goes on this
side of the wall I think I might just

278
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:05,029
side of the wall I think I might just
 

279
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:10,579
side of the wall I think I might just
mirror it actually so if we copy the

280
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:10,589
mirror it actually so if we copy the
 

281
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:20,929
mirror it actually so if we copy the
same distance like this at the same

282
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:20,939
same distance like this at the same
 

283
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,859
same distance like this at the same
width one two three one two three yeah

284
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:24,869
width one two three one two three yeah
 

285
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,159
width one two three one two three yeah
okay so maybe we make this come all the

286
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:28,169
okay so maybe we make this come all the
 

287
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,229
okay so maybe we make this come all the
way across and the nice thing about like

288
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:33,239
way across and the nice thing about like
 

289
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,569
way across and the nice thing about like
working with this concrete it's a pretty

290
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:35,579
working with this concrete it's a pretty
 

291
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,969
working with this concrete it's a pretty
plain block which means we don't have to

292
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:37,979
plain block which means we don't have to
 

293
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,069
plain block which means we don't have to
add a lot of detail to the build wait I

294
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:40,079
add a lot of detail to the build wait I
 

295
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,749
add a lot of detail to the build wait I
like that for bigger builds like this

296
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
like that for bigger builds like this
 

297
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,919
like that for bigger builds like this
because otherwise it would take me

298
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:42,929
because otherwise it would take me
 

299
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:48,829
because otherwise it would take me
forever to finish then maybe you let's

300
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:48,839
forever to finish then maybe you let's
 

301
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,389
forever to finish then maybe you let's
just do what we did here and have glass

302
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:50,399
just do what we did here and have glass
 

303
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,699
just do what we did here and have glass
or we could put foam blocks might look

304
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:52,709
or we could put foam blocks might look
 

305
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:58,320
or we could put foam blocks might look
cool here too

306
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,330

 

307
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,550

let's use some of this grass to build up

308
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
let's use some of this grass to build up
 

309
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:10,330
let's use some of this grass to build up
the train around here as well I'm a

310
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,340
the train around here as well I'm a
 

311
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,050
the train around here as well I'm a
little worried I wasn't worried about

312
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,060
little worried I wasn't worried about
 

313
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,469
little worried I wasn't worried about
that but I should have been no I was

314
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
that but I should have been no I was
 

315
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,029
that but I should have been no I was
gonna say I'm a little worried this

316
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,039
gonna say I'm a little worried this
 

317
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,960
gonna say I'm a little worried this
might be a little on the plain side but

318
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:25,970
might be a little on the plain side but
 

319
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,999
might be a little on the plain side but
we'll see and I that's why you gotta

320
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:31,009
we'll see and I that's why you gotta
 

321
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,950
we'll see and I that's why you gotta
sleep guys always sleep sleep away the

322
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
sleep guys always sleep sleep away the
 

323
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,240
sleep guys always sleep sleep away the
nights I wanted to see the lighting

324
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,250
nights I wanted to see the lighting
 

325
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,680
nights I wanted to see the lighting
though and it seemed kind of dark around

326
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,690
though and it seemed kind of dark around
 

327
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,070
though and it seemed kind of dark around
here so we'll probably stick some seed

328
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,080
here so we'll probably stick some seed
 

329
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,790
here so we'll probably stick some seed
lanterns in with the prismarine but yeah

330
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
lanterns in with the prismarine but yeah
 

331
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,710
lanterns in with the prismarine but yeah
I do like this window so I framed I put

332
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
I do like this window so I framed I put
 

333
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,330
I do like this window so I framed I put
a frame around it I think that's cool I

334
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,340
a frame around it I think that's cool I
 

335
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,040
a frame around it I think that's cool I
love seeing the wiring I think that

336
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,050
love seeing the wiring I think that
 

337
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,080
love seeing the wiring I think that
wiring looks pretty cool it's one of the

338
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,090
wiring looks pretty cool it's one of the
 

339
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,700
wiring looks pretty cool it's one of the
few times I actually use like multiple

340
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:51,710
few times I actually use like multiple
 

341
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,040
few times I actually use like multiple
colors for the different lines so we got

342
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,050
colors for the different lines so we got
 

343
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,330
colors for the different lines so we got
all these different colors a terra cotta

344
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,340
all these different colors a terra cotta
 

345
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,089
all these different colors a terra cotta
in there which looks kind of crazy and

346
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:58,099
in there which looks kind of crazy and
 

347
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,550
in there which looks kind of crazy and
chaotic right maybe every three blocks

348
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
chaotic right maybe every three blocks
 

349
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,870
chaotic right maybe every three blocks
and good stuff so that should keep our

350
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:04,880
and good stuff so that should keep our
 

351
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,309
and good stuff so that should keep our
floor nice and bright now that we've got

352
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
floor nice and bright now that we've got
 

353
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,649
floor nice and bright now that we've got
all these sea lanterns mixed in I'm

354
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:08,659
all these sea lanterns mixed in I'm
 

355
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,870
all these sea lanterns mixed in I'm
gonna try and make it a bit more

356
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:09,880
gonna try and make it a bit more
 

357
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,870
gonna try and make it a bit more
interesting not just by like making this

358
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:13,880
interesting not just by like making this
 

359
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,040
interesting not just by like making this
come out do the same on this side

360
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,050
come out do the same on this side
 

361
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,219
come out do the same on this side
obviously and then we'll probably try

362
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:21,229
obviously and then we'll probably try
 

363
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,170
obviously and then we'll probably try
add some prismarine bricks mixed in with

364
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,180
add some prismarine bricks mixed in with
 

365
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,230
add some prismarine bricks mixed in with
this other stuff and and create some

366
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
this other stuff and and create some
 

367
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,540
this other stuff and and create some
patterns so maybe let's do like a star

368
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,550
patterns so maybe let's do like a star
 

369
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,389
patterns so maybe let's do like a star
shape here there's a lotta loads and

370
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
shape here there's a lotta loads and
 

371
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
shape here there's a lotta loads and
then put this in yes so there's a bit

372
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:36,890
then put this in yes so there's a bit
 

373
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,000
then put this in yes so there's a bit
more bright variety to it right and then

374
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,010
more bright variety to it right and then
 

375
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,219
more bright variety to it right and then
for these let's also put some some

376
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:42,229
for these let's also put some some
 

377
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,949
for these let's also put some some
breaks around the lights oh yeah that

378
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
breaks around the lights oh yeah that
 

379
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,840
breaks around the lights oh yeah that
helps it out quite a bit alright I'm

380
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:46,850
helps it out quite a bit alright I'm
 

381
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,400
helps it out quite a bit alright I'm
mostly worried about this floor being

382
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,410
mostly worried about this floor being
 

383
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,340
mostly worried about this floor being
kind of boring cuz it's like a big wide

384
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,350
kind of boring cuz it's like a big wide
 

385
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,970
kind of boring cuz it's like a big wide
area all all the same colour you know

386
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:53,980
area all all the same colour you know
 

387
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,319
area all all the same colour you know
hopefully hopefully that's good so we're

388
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,329
hopefully hopefully that's good so we're
 

389
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:07,400
hopefully hopefully that's good so we're
gonna glass over it

390
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,410

 

391
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,870

all right so check it out it's starting

392
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:09,880
all right so check it out it's starting
 

393
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
all right so check it out it's starting
to come together here we mirrored the

394
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:11,890
to come together here we mirrored the
 

395
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,980
to come together here we mirrored the
window to the other side did the border

396
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:13,990
window to the other side did the border
 

397
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,380
window to the other side did the border
around it we got our crazy floor with

398
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,390
around it we got our crazy floor with
 

399
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,460
around it we got our crazy floor with
some random patterns starting to feel

400
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,470
some random patterns starting to feel
 

401
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,760
some random patterns starting to feel
like something right I think we got to

402
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,770
like something right I think we got to
 

403
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,900
like something right I think we got to
get rid of the hill there though

404
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:24,910
get rid of the hill there though
 

405
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,510
get rid of the hill there though
we got no view or I also got to change a

406
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,520
we got no view or I also got to change a
 

407
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,860
we got no view or I also got to change a
window with foam blocks I'm still

408
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,870
window with foam blocks I'm still
 

409
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,750
window with foam blocks I'm still
considering that but we'd have to do a

410
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:30,760
considering that but we'd have to do a
 

411
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,480
considering that but we'd have to do a
lot of terraforming here which might be

412
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,490
lot of terraforming here which might be
 

413
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,830
lot of terraforming here which might be
worth doing I do kind of like the window

414
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:34,840
worth doing I do kind of like the window
 

415
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,230
worth doing I do kind of like the window
though cuz you can see the wiring from

416
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,240
though cuz you can see the wiring from
 

417
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,100
though cuz you can see the wiring from
outside that way and and like some of

418
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,110
outside that way and and like some of
 

419
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,620
outside that way and and like some of
the building right I think the next

420
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:43,630
the building right I think the next
 

421
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,820
the building right I think the next
thing we're gonna do is try to work on

422
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:44,830
thing we're gonna do is try to work on
 

423
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,500
thing we're gonna do is try to work on
connecting this part of the build to

424
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,510
connecting this part of the build to
 

425
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,590
connecting this part of the build to
that part now so we we changed that out

426
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
that part now so we we changed that out
 

427
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,300
that part now so we we changed that out
several times now I'm gonna do it one

428
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,310
several times now I'm gonna do it one
 

429
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,790
several times now I'm gonna do it one
last time we're gonna get rid of the

430
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:53,800
last time we're gonna get rid of the
 

431
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
last time we're gonna get rid of the
dark prism arena and we're gonna put the

432
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,330
dark prism arena and we're gonna put the
 

433
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,600
dark prism arena and we're gonna put the
gray end I think that's that's gonna be

434
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,610
gray end I think that's that's gonna be
 

435
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,440
gray end I think that's that's gonna be
the final look

436
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,450
the final look
 

437
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,810
the final look
uh-huh yeah that's like our fourth or

438
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:00,820
uh-huh yeah that's like our fourth or
 

439
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,110
uh-huh yeah that's like our fourth or
fifth time changing that oh it's perfect

440
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,120
fifth time changing that oh it's perfect
 

441
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,750
fifth time changing that oh it's perfect
now right guys you all love it right

442
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
now right guys you all love it right
 

443
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,270
now right guys you all love it right
it's not just me

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,280
it's not just me
 

445
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,880
it's not just me
yeah I feel like I'm gonna come back in

446
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:11,890
yeah I feel like I'm gonna come back in
 

447
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,320
yeah I feel like I'm gonna come back in
a month and be like what was I thinking

448
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,330
a month and be like what was I thinking
 

449
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,380
a month and be like what was I thinking
you know all right so we're gonna put

450
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,390
you know all right so we're gonna put
 

451
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,240
you know all right so we're gonna put
some we're gonna put a staircase here it

452
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,250
some we're gonna put a staircase here it
 

453
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,230
some we're gonna put a staircase here it
would it's the bottom layer looks like

454
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
would it's the bottom layer looks like
 

455
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,140
would it's the bottom layer looks like
it's gonna end up around here which is

456
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,150
it's gonna end up around here which is
 

457
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,070
it's gonna end up around here which is
actually perfect look at this don't have

458
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,080
actually perfect look at this don't have
 

459
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,170
actually perfect look at this don't have
to change any lights or anything all

460
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,180
to change any lights or anything all
 

461
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,390
to change any lights or anything all
lines up good so fill that in the rest

462
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,400
lines up good so fill that in the rest
 

463
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,360
lines up good so fill that in the rest
of the way uh-huh uh-huh now we gotta

464
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,370
of the way uh-huh uh-huh now we gotta
 

465
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,170
of the way uh-huh uh-huh now we gotta
like do some wire dodging here so we got

466
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,180
like do some wire dodging here so we got
 

467
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,370
like do some wire dodging here so we got
wires there but I think we can place

468
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,380
wires there but I think we can place
 

469
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,350
wires there but I think we can place
some of this over here without wrecking

470
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:46,360
some of this over here without wrecking
 

471
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,710
some of this over here without wrecking
them right so can we do the same on the

472
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:49,720
them right so can we do the same on the
 

473
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,100
them right so can we do the same on the
other side here yeah we gotta be really

474
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,110
other side here yeah we gotta be really
 

475
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,600
other side here yeah we gotta be really
careful working around the wires here

476
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:54,610
careful working around the wires here
 

477
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,390
careful working around the wires here
because I can easily mess it up yeah

478
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:57,400
because I can easily mess it up yeah
 

479
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,450
because I can easily mess it up yeah
yeah we'll do it classic ethos staircase

480
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:00,460
yeah we'll do it classic ethos staircase
 

481
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,680
yeah we'll do it classic ethos staircase
here I got to maybe get a little bit

482
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:01,690
here I got to maybe get a little bit
 

483
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,840
here I got to maybe get a little bit
better at building staircases I feel

484
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:03,850
better at building staircases I feel
 

485
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,700
better at building staircases I feel
like I always do the exact same thing

486
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:05,710
like I always do the exact same thing
 

487
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,820
like I always do the exact same thing
where I just make them three wide and

488
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:08,830
where I just make them three wide and
 

489
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,590
where I just make them three wide and
then I do a border around the sides is

490
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,600
then I do a border around the sides is
 

491
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
then I do a border around the sides is
that what other people do too like is

492
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,010
that what other people do too like is
 

493
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,760
that what other people do too like is
there any other way of doing it

494
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:14,770
there any other way of doing it
 

495
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,250
there any other way of doing it
it works for me but it's also not very

496
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:18,260
it works for me but it's also not very
 

497
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,720
it works for me but it's also not very
creative because I always do the same

498
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:19,730
creative because I always do the same
 

499
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,700
creative because I always do the same
thing again the middle mouse button what

500
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:21,710
thing again the middle mouse button what
 

501
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,010
thing again the middle mouse button what
I think it selects it and then it

502
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,020
I think it selects it and then it
 

503
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,270
I think it selects it and then it
Scrolls I think that's what's happening

504
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,280
Scrolls I think that's what's happening
 

505
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,620
Scrolls I think that's what's happening
to me okay so that feels really good

506
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,630
to me okay so that feels really good
 

507
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,510
to me okay so that feels really good
right I just got to fill in a little

508
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:31,520
right I just got to fill in a little
 

509
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,770
right I just got to fill in a little
section here what's wrong with this boat

510
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:37,780
section here what's wrong with this boat
 

511
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,510
section here what's wrong with this boat
let's run with this boat stop it we're

512
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:43,520
let's run with this boat stop it we're
 

513
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,200
let's run with this boat stop it we're
good we're good

514
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,210
good we're good
 

515
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,830
good we're good
okay so I thought it might be nice for a

516
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:47,840
okay so I thought it might be nice for a
 

517
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
okay so I thought it might be nice for a
bit of variety this episode for took a

518
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,370
bit of variety this episode for took a
 

519
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,680
bit of variety this episode for took a
break from the building there and just

520
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:50,690
break from the building there and just
 

521
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,240
break from the building there and just
worked on a quick project that this

522
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,250
worked on a quick project that this
 

523
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,270
worked on a quick project that this
great firm we set up a while ago so this

524
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,280
great firm we set up a while ago so this
 

525
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,500
great firm we set up a while ago so this
thing's pretty cool they spawn down

526
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,510
thing's pretty cool they spawn down
 

527
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,480
thing's pretty cool they spawn down
below they go up some water elevators

528
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,490
below they go up some water elevators
 

529
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,910
below they go up some water elevators
all to a central point they fall down

530
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:00,920
all to a central point they fall down
 

531
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,760
all to a central point they fall down
here and then we can we can kill them

532
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:03,770
here and then we can we can kill them
 

533
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,940
here and then we can we can kill them
for some XP we get that raid buff so

534
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:06,950
for some XP we get that raid buff so
 

535
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,290
for some XP we get that raid buff so
when we enter our village it triggers a

536
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,300
when we enter our village it triggers a
 

537
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,180
when we enter our village it triggers a
raid and we got a villager over there

538
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,190
raid and we got a villager over there
 

539
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,950
raid and we got a villager over there
making a lot of noise but these guys

540
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:17,960
making a lot of noise but these guys
 

541
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,620
making a lot of noise but these guys
also drop crossbows sometimes enchanted

542
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,630
also drop crossbows sometimes enchanted
 

543
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,480
also drop crossbows sometimes enchanted
and they drop banners both of which we

544
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,490
and they drop banners both of which we
 

545
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,000
and they drop banners both of which we
can use to smelt stuff in furnaces so I

546
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,010
can use to smelt stuff in furnaces so I
 

547
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,970
can use to smelt stuff in furnaces so I
wanted to maybe set up a thing down

548
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:27,980
wanted to maybe set up a thing down
 

549
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,120
wanted to maybe set up a thing down
below here for auto smelting could be a

550
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,130
below here for auto smelting could be a
 

551
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,950
below here for auto smelting could be a
cool little project and also I want to

552
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:32,960
cool little project and also I want to
 

553
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,180
cool little project and also I want to
be able to like pick through the

554
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,190
be able to like pick through the
 

555
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,340
be able to like pick through the
crossbows we get and see if there's any

556
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,350
crossbows we get and see if there's any
 

557
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,250
crossbows we get and see if there's any
good enchanted ones that we might want

558
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,260
good enchanted ones that we might want
 

559
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,710
good enchanted ones that we might want
to use so yeah well we'll set some

560
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:41,720
to use so yeah well we'll set some
 

561
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,300
to use so yeah well we'll set some
hoppers below the slabs they'll pick up

562
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,310
hoppers below the slabs they'll pick up
 

563
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,030
hoppers below the slabs they'll pick up
the crossbows that drop then we'll

564
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,040
the crossbows that drop then we'll
 

565
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,730
the crossbows that drop then we'll
funnel all of those into a double chest

566
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:48,740
funnel all of those into a double chest
 

567
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,240
funnel all of those into a double chest
here run into the side so they should

568
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,250
here run into the side so they should
 

569
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,320
here run into the side so they should
all gather to one point and then let's

570
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,330
all gather to one point and then let's
 

571
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,410
all gather to one point and then let's
just run it maybe into two furnaces you

572
00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,420
just run it maybe into two furnaces you
 

573
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,730
just run it maybe into two furnaces you
can see how that works out oh yeah like

574
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:03,740
can see how that works out oh yeah like
 

575
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,830
can see how that works out oh yeah like
that and then point the hoppers into the

576
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:05,840
that and then point the hoppers into the
 

577
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,020
that and then point the hoppers into the
side and we want to

578
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,030

 

579
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,750

yeah let's know that's a hard placement

580
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
yeah let's know that's a hard placement
 

581
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,060
yeah let's know that's a hard placement
you know like jump and shift at the same

582
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,070
you know like jump and shift at the same
 

583
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,300
you know like jump and shift at the same
time yeah we want some hoppers pointing

584
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,310
time yeah we want some hoppers pointing
 

585
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,580
time yeah we want some hoppers pointing
down so that's where we can place our

586
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:22,590
down so that's where we can place our
 

587
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,770
down so that's where we can place our
stuff we want to smelts into this double

588
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:24,780
stuff we want to smelts into this double
 

589
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,660
stuff we want to smelts into this double
chest that should open yeah okay so any

590
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:29,670
chest that should open yeah okay so any
 

591
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,790
chest that should open yeah okay so any
crossbows in here should go into the

592
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,800
crossbows in here should go into the
 

593
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,110
crossbows in here should go into the
fuel slot yeah okay good and anything we

594
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,120
fuel slot yeah okay good and anything we
 

595
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,620
fuel slot yeah okay good and anything we
want to smell it should go the top slot

596
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,630
want to smell it should go the top slot
 

597
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,550
want to smell it should go the top slot
yeah okay good good so then we want to

598
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,560
yeah okay good good so then we want to
 

599
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,170
yeah okay good good so then we want to
take those items out of there and put

600
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,180
take those items out of there and put
 

601
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,230
take those items out of there and put
them into a chest that we can pick up oh

602
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,240
them into a chest that we can pick up oh
 

603
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,900
them into a chest that we can pick up oh
I guess we got a probably place that

604
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,910
I guess we got a probably place that
 

605
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,970
I guess we got a probably place that
first put in the front here put these

606
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:55,980
first put in the front here put these
 

607
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,670
first put in the front here put these
underneath the furnaces anything that

608
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:58,680
underneath the furnaces anything that
 

609
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,130
underneath the furnaces anything that
smelt should go into here now and then I

610
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,140
smelt should go into here now and then I
 

611
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,240
smelt should go into here now and then I
kind of wanted to set up some lava

612
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,250
kind of wanted to set up some lava
 

613
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,120
kind of wanted to set up some lava
somewhere actually so that we could just

614
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,130
somewhere actually so that we could just
 

615
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,160
somewhere actually so that we could just
destroy any crossbows that aren't

616
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,170
destroy any crossbows that aren't
 

617
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,180
destroy any crossbows that aren't
enchanted like when we're picking

618
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,190
enchanted like when we're picking
 

619
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:17,600
enchanted like when we're picking
through them oh yeah we can we can click

620
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,610
through them oh yeah we can we can click
 

621
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,680
through them oh yeah we can we can click
the double chests here like these

622
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:18,690
the double chests here like these
 

623
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,590
the double chests here like these
hoppers aren't really in the way so we

624
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
hoppers aren't really in the way so we
 

625
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,060
hoppers aren't really in the way so we
can access everything from here but I

626
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,070
can access everything from here but I
 

627
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,680
can access everything from here but I
think it maybe we changed that and have

628
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,690
think it maybe we changed that and have
 

629
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:35,620
think it maybe we changed that and have
these sticking out on the side like this

630
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,630

 

631
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,800

yeah

632
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:36,810
yeah
 

633
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,270
yeah
so that'll that'll give it a little bit

634
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,280
so that'll that'll give it a little bit
 

635
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,110
so that'll that'll give it a little bit
more storage for the crossbows but also

636
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
more storage for the crossbows but also
 

637
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,700
more storage for the crossbows but also
we can put some lava like over here and

638
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:45,710
we can put some lava like over here and
 

639
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,140
we can put some lava like over here and
then as we're looking through the chest

640
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,150
then as we're looking through the chest
 

641
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,090
then as we're looking through the chest
of the crossbows we can just press Q to

642
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,100
of the crossbows we can just press Q to
 

643
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,910
of the crossbows we can just press Q to
throw them into the lab a sort of thing

644
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
throw them into the lab a sort of thing
 

645
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,079
throw them into the lab a sort of thing
so let's set that up

646
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,089

 

647
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,650

probably like that right and then

648
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:02,660
probably like that right and then
 

649
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,340
probably like that right and then
actually let's grab some trapdoors here

650
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,350
actually let's grab some trapdoors here
 

651
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,920
actually let's grab some trapdoors here
yeah so we'll put the trapdoors here

652
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:07,930
yeah so we'll put the trapdoors here
 

653
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,010
yeah so we'll put the trapdoors here
then we can put lava in there all right

654
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,020
then we can put lava in there all right
 

655
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,329
then we can put lava in there all right
both sides and then kind of build this

656
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:16,339
both sides and then kind of build this
 

657
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,760
both sides and then kind of build this
up a little bit like that yeah so check

658
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:21,770
up a little bit like that yeah so check
 

659
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,320
up a little bit like that yeah so check
this out after we kill a few of these

660
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,330
this out after we kill a few of these
 

661
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,350
this out after we kill a few of these
guys right we go down below here we

662
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
guys right we go down below here we
 

663
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
guys right we go down below here we
should have a bunch of crossbows and

664
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:27,770
should have a bunch of crossbows and
 

665
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,160
should have a bunch of crossbows and
like any that aren't enchanted we can

666
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,170
like any that aren't enchanted we can
 

667
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,900
like any that aren't enchanted we can
just press Q now they'll go into a lava

668
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,910
just press Q now they'll go into a lava
 

669
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,940
just press Q now they'll go into a lava
and just get destroyed like if we're not

670
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:33,950
and just get destroyed like if we're not
 

671
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,300
and just get destroyed like if we're not
smelting stuff and we're trying to get a

672
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,310
smelting stuff and we're trying to get a
 

673
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,910
smelting stuff and we're trying to get a
bunch of enchanted ones that'll EDD

674
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
bunch of enchanted ones that'll EDD
 

675
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
bunch of enchanted ones that'll EDD
Allah allow us to pick through them

676
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,210
Allah allow us to pick through them
 

677
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,220
Allah allow us to pick through them
pretty quickly that's cool just add a

678
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,230
pretty quickly that's cool just add a
 

679
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,230
pretty quickly that's cool just add a
couple more blocks here and yeah I think

680
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
couple more blocks here and yeah I think
 

681
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,579
couple more blocks here and yeah I think
it's pretty good just like that it's

682
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:51,589
it's pretty good just like that it's
 

683
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,769
it's pretty good just like that it's
nothing too crazy right simple project

684
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:53,779
nothing too crazy right simple project
 

685
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,500
nothing too crazy right simple project
but should allow us to get some good

686
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:56,510
but should allow us to get some good
 

687
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,500
but should allow us to get some good
crossbows when we want them I decorated

688
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,510
crossbows when we want them I decorated
 

689
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,390
crossbows when we want them I decorated
it a little bit you know nothing crazy

690
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,400
it a little bit you know nothing crazy
 

691
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,190
it a little bit you know nothing crazy
and I added some ladders so we can

692
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,200
and I added some ladders so we can
 

693
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,260
and I added some ladders so we can
actually get up to these guys but good

694
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,270
actually get up to these guys but good
 

695
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,060
actually get up to these guys but good
because before I had to use ender pearls

696
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,070
because before I had to use ender pearls
 

697
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,480
because before I had to use ender pearls
or a rocket every time just kind of

698
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,490
or a rocket every time just kind of
 

699
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,130
or a rocket every time just kind of
annoying actually it's a XP pretty quick

700
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,140
annoying actually it's a XP pretty quick
 

701
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,490
annoying actually it's a XP pretty quick
with this thing - it's not bad uh-huh

702
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:18,500
with this thing - it's not bad uh-huh
 

703
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,590
with this thing - it's not bad uh-huh
but anyways we are back out of here guys

704
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:20,600
but anyways we are back out of here guys
 

705
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,110
but anyways we are back out of here guys
let's get back to the building so I did

706
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
let's get back to the building so I did
 

707
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,110
let's get back to the building so I did
fill in the little spots here just put a

708
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,120
fill in the little spots here just put a
 

709
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,650
fill in the little spots here just put a
spotlight in and some blue clay I think

710
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:29,660
spotlight in and some blue clay I think
 

711
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,050
spotlight in and some blue clay I think
that looks pretty cool I thought I'd try

712
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,060
that looks pretty cool I thought I'd try
 

713
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,380
that looks pretty cool I thought I'd try
to do a story time with etho though as

714
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,390
to do a story time with etho though as
 

715
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,150
to do a story time with etho though as
we do a bit more building here if I can

716
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,160
we do a bit more building here if I can
 

717
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,940
we do a bit more building here if I can
I saw on the last episode once again

718
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:39,950
I saw on the last episode once again
 

719
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,290
I saw on the last episode once again
something that comes up quite often

720
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:41,300
something that comes up quite often
 

721
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,960
something that comes up quite often
actually people are like you know I

722
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:43,970
actually people are like you know I
 

723
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,150
actually people are like you know I
don't know you might want to go to the

724
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
don't know you might want to go to the
 

725
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,990

doctor get yourself checked out I think

726
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,000
doctor get yourself checked out I think
 

727
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,540
doctor get yourself checked out I think
you might be a programmer just just the

728
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:52,550
you might be a programmer just just the
 

729
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,250
you might be a programmer just just the
way you're doing that redstone no no you

730
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,260
way you're doing that redstone no no you
 

731
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,820

might might want to get looked at so I

732
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:57,830
might might want to get looked at so I
 

733
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,010
might might want to get looked at so I
thought I'd give you guys a quick little

734
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,020
thought I'd give you guys a quick little
 

735
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,990
thought I'd give you guys a quick little
rough history of my programming

736
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
rough history of my programming
 

737
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,210
rough history of my programming
experience because yes I I do know a

738
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,220
experience because yes I I do know a
 

739
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,130
experience because yes I I do know a
little bit about programming I am NOT a

740
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,140
little bit about programming I am NOT a
 

741
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,929
little bit about programming I am NOT a
professional programmer by any means I

self-taught
but I started learning programming when

748
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:14,289
but I started learning programming when
 

749
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,460
but I started learning programming when
I was eight years old that's right I

750
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,470
I was eight years old that's right I
 

751
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,769
I was eight years old that's right I
knew guys at that age when I grow up I'm

753
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,389
knew guys at that age when I grow up I'm
gonna make video games for a living that

754
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:24,399
gonna make video games for a living that
 

755
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,029
gonna make video games for a living that
was my dream job I had it all figured

756
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
was my dream job I had it all figured
 

757
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,809
was my dream job I had it all figured
out

758
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:27,819
out
 

759
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,169
out
but life can be cruel guys at can only

760
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:31,179
but life can be cruel guys at can only
 

761
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:32,730
but life can be cruel guys at can only
play video games for a living I don't

762
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:32,740
play video games for a living I don't
 

763
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,139
play video games for a living I don't
gonna make them oh man whoa is me right

764
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:37,149
gonna make them oh man whoa is me right
 

765
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:38,129
gonna make them oh man whoa is me right
uh-huh

766

uh-huh
 

767
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,159
uh-huh
so I got into programming so that I

768
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:41,169
so I got into programming so that I
 

769
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,499
so I got into programming so that I
could you know pursue that dream you

770
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:43,509
could you know pursue that dream you
 

771
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:43,950
could you know pursue that dream you
know

772
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:43,960
know
 

773
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
know
I got Visual Basic 3 is my first

774
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:45,970
I got Visual Basic 3 is my first
 

775
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,739
I got Visual Basic 3 is my first
programming language which maybe not the

776
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:49,749
programming language which maybe not the
 

777
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,509
programming language which maybe not the
best one to start with because it wasn't

778
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:51,519
best one to start with because it wasn't
 

779
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,159
best one to start with because it wasn't
the greatest of languages but you know

780
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:53,169
the greatest of languages but you know
 

781
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,619
the greatest of languages but you know
it's okay and I got like a bunch of

782
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:58,629
it's okay and I got like a bunch of
 

783
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:01,489
it's okay and I got like a bunch of
books they used to sell these books like

784
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:01,499
books they used to sell these books like
 

785
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,549
books they used to sell these books like
they were a thousand pages usually or

786
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
they were a thousand pages usually or
 

787
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,529
they were a thousand pages usually or
1500 pages and they would give you a

788
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:07,539
1500 pages and they would give you a
 

789
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,409
1500 pages and they would give you a
couple examples on um programming's like

790
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:10,419
couple examples on um programming's like
 

791
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,029
couple examples on um programming's like
some test projects for you to make to

792
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:12,039
some test projects for you to make to
 

793
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,190
some test projects for you to make to
teach you how to do it you know like

794
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,200
teach you how to do it you know like
 

795
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,489
teach you how to do it you know like
hello world and they would get more and

796
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:17,499
hello world and they would get more and
 

797
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,639
hello world and they would get more and
more complicated so I would read through

798
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:20,649
more complicated so I would read through
 

799
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:22,230
more complicated so I would read through
those and and sort of learn a couple

800
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
those and and sort of learn a couple
 

801
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,440
those and and sort of learn a couple
things and then I think about I think I

802
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,450
things and then I think about I think I
 

803
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,149
things and then I think about I think I
bought about like ten of those books or

804
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:30,159
bought about like ten of those books or
 

805
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,440
bought about like ten of those books or
so so they some of them were more

806
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,450
so so they some of them were more
 

807
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,509
so so they some of them were more
advanced than others and slowly I was

808
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:33,519
advanced than others and slowly I was
 

809
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,789
advanced than others and slowly I was
learning more and more right by the time

810
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:35,799
learning more and more right by the time
 

811
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,009
learning more and more right by the time
I was nine years old I made my first

812
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:38,019
I was nine years old I made my first
 

813
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,820
I was nine years old I made my first
game it was a Frogger clone with pretty

814
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:41,830
game it was a Frogger clone with pretty
 

815
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,350
game it was a Frogger clone with pretty
much all the features like totally

816
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
much all the features like totally
 

817
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,409
much all the features like totally
implemented like the vehicles at

818
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:46,419
implemented like the vehicles at
 

819
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,210
implemented like the vehicles at
collision I drew all the pixel art

820
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,220
collision I drew all the pixel art
 

821
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,590
collision I drew all the pixel art
myself I would show you a screenshot of

822
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,600
myself I would show you a screenshot of
 

823
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,450
myself I would show you a screenshot of
it if I could run it but it's like I'm

824
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,460
it if I could run it but it's like I'm
 

825
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,190
it if I could run it but it's like I'm
an old computer of mine so I can't

826
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,200
an old computer of mine so I can't
 

827
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,060
an old computer of mine so I can't
really show you but yeah it was that

828
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,070
really show you but yeah it was that
 

829
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,379
really show you but yeah it was that
pretty good for Agra Cologne you know it

830
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:01,389
pretty good for Agra Cologne you know it
 

831
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,029
pretty good for Agra Cologne you know it
wasn't bad it would get more difficult

832
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
wasn't bad it would get more difficult
 

833
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,799
wasn't bad it would get more difficult
as he progressed through the levels and

834
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:04,809
as he progressed through the levels and
 

835
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,810
as he progressed through the levels and
all that kind of stuff and then I was

836
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:06,820
all that kind of stuff and then I was
 

837
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,109
all that kind of stuff and then I was
gonna go I think at that point I decided

838
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:10,119
gonna go I think at that point I decided
 

839
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,519
gonna go I think at that point I decided
you know I gotta get something better so

840
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:11,529
you know I gotta get something better so
 

841
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:14,850
you know I gotta get something better so
I upgraded to Visual Basic 6 spent like

842
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:14,860
I upgraded to Visual Basic 6 spent like
 

843
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,980
I upgraded to Visual Basic 6 spent like
all my money buying that it was like a

844
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:16,990
all my money buying that it was like a
 

845
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,139
all my money buying that it was like a
hundred bucks or something crazy I just

846
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:19,149
hundred bucks or something crazy I just
 

847
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,029
hundred bucks or something crazy I just
worked on a couple more details here I

848
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
worked on a couple more details here I
 

849
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,830
worked on a couple more details here I
think that's good now we're gonna go up

850
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
think that's good now we're gonna go up
 

851
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,019
think that's good now we're gonna go up
there and start building some stuff too

852
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:25,029
there and start building some stuff too
 

853
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,299
there and start building some stuff too
but yeah I think the next big project

854
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:27,309
but yeah I think the next big project
 

855
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:28,979
but yeah I think the next big project
like the next game I tried to make was a

856
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:28,989
like the next game I tried to make was a
 

857
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:33,979
like the next game I tried to make was a
Tetris clone and that did not go so well

858
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:33,989
Tetris clone and that did not go so well
 

859
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,059
Tetris clone and that did not go so well
again I was nine years old at the time

860
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:36,069
again I was nine years old at the time
 

861
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,849
again I was nine years old at the time
and I did not understand the concept of

862
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:38,859
and I did not understand the concept of
 

863
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:40,859
and I did not understand the concept of
a race and it's not like I could go ask

864
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:40,869
a race and it's not like I could go ask
 

865
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,899
a race and it's not like I could go ask
somebody for help either right

866
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:42,909
somebody for help either right
 

867
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,759
somebody for help either right
like I couldn't just go to stack

868
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:44,769
like I couldn't just go to stack
 

869
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,769
like I couldn't just go to stack
overflow whenever I had a question I had

870
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:46,779
overflow whenever I had a question I had
 

871
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,499
overflow whenever I had a question I had
to figure it out myself I didn't have

872
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:49,509
to figure it out myself I didn't have
 

873
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:52,799
to figure it out myself I didn't have
the Internet and I just couldn't

874
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:52,809
the Internet and I just couldn't
 

875
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,619
the Internet and I just couldn't
couldn't really make the Tetris because

876
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:55,629
couldn't really make the Tetris because
 

877
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,969
couldn't really make the Tetris because
I didn't understand arrays and they're

878
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:56,979
I didn't understand arrays and they're
 

879
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,069
I didn't understand arrays and they're
pretty important when you're doing

880
00:19:59,069 --> 00:19:59,079
pretty important when you're doing
 

881
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,219
pretty important when you're doing
something like that so I gave up on that

882
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:02,229
something like that so I gave up on that
 

883
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:03,689
something like that so I gave up on that
and I think I just did a bunch of like

884
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:03,699
and I think I just did a bunch of like
 

885
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,399
and I think I just did a bunch of like
test projects for a while to try get

886
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:05,409
test projects for a while to try get
 

887
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,709
test projects for a while to try get
better experienced with programming

888
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:07,719
better experienced with programming
 

889
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,699
better experienced with programming
because it's like when you're learning

890
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:08,709
because it's like when you're learning
 

891
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,379
because it's like when you're learning
programming programming you usually

892
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:10,389
programming programming you usually
 

893
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:11,939
programming programming you usually
don't want to make like some big giant

894
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:11,949
don't want to make like some big giant
 

895
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,159
don't want to make like some big giant
projects you want to go a bunch of

896
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:14,169
projects you want to go a bunch of
 

897
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,779
projects you want to go a bunch of
little projects and just build up your

898
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:15,789
little projects and just build up your
 

899
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,489
little projects and just build up your
experience and understanding of how

900
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:17,499
experience and understanding of how
 

901
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:20,699
experience and understanding of how
things how to do things you know so I

902
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:20,709
things how to do things you know so I
 

903
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,109
things how to do things you know so I
just did a bunch of test projects for a

904
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:22,119
just did a bunch of test projects for a
 

905
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,239
just did a bunch of test projects for a
long time and I think it was like when I

906
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,249
long time and I think it was like when I
 

907
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:26,489
long time and I think it was like when I
was 13 years old I got my first online

908
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:26,499
was 13 years old I got my first online
 

909
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,819
was 13 years old I got my first online
game I played which was worms Armageddon

910
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:29,829
game I played which was worms Armageddon
 

911
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,899
game I played which was worms Armageddon
and worms world party and then when I

912
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:33,909
and worms world party and then when I
 

913
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,329
and worms world party and then when I
got those games it kind of ticked off my

914
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:36,339
got those games it kind of ticked off my
 

915
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,629
got those games it kind of ticked off my
programming experience a little bit more

916
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:39,639
programming experience a little bit more
 

917
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,069
programming experience a little bit more
because those games had a lot of like

918
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:41,079
because those games had a lot of like
 

919
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,099
because those games had a lot of like
custom files in them like you could make

920
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:44,109
custom files in them like you could make
 

921
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,099
custom files in them like you could make
your own teams in the game you could

922
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:46,109
your own teams in the game you could
 

923
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,509
your own teams in the game you could
make what were called schemes that was

924
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:48,519
make what were called schemes that was
 

925
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,569
make what were called schemes that was
it's like the game settings and stuff so

926
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:51,579
it's like the game settings and stuff so
 

927
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,039
it's like the game settings and stuff so
I challenged myself to try make some

928
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,049
I challenged myself to try make some
 

929
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,719
I challenged myself to try make some
editors for that game like scheme

930
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:54,729
editors for that game like scheme
 

931
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,959
editors for that game like scheme
editors team editors map editors which

932
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:57,969
editors team editors map editors which
 

933
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:59,339
editors team editors map editors which
meant I had to learn how to read and

934
00:20:59,339 --> 00:20:59,349
meant I had to learn how to read and
 

935
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:03,169
meant I had to learn how to read and
write files in programming I had to

936
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:03,179
write files in programming I had to
 

937
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,089
write files in programming I had to
figure out how a hex editor works cuz I

938
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:06,099
figure out how a hex editor works cuz I
 

939
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,429
figure out how a hex editor works cuz I
had to reverse-engineer the file formats

940
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:08,439
had to reverse-engineer the file formats
 

941
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,619
had to reverse-engineer the file formats
I had the Internet

942
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:10,629
I had the Internet
 

943
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:11,849
I had the Internet
at that point that's when I got the

944
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:11,859
at that point that's when I got the
 

945
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,799
at that point that's when I got the
internet when I was 13 so I could

946
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:13,809
internet when I was 13 so I could
 

947
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,239
internet when I was 13 so I could
actually look online for help and stuff

948
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:15,249
actually look online for help and stuff
 

949
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:18,569
actually look online for help and stuff
at that point made a huge difference oh

950
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:18,579
at that point made a huge difference oh
 

951
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,919
at that point made a huge difference oh
my goodness so basically you would like

952
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:21,929
my goodness so basically you would like
 

953
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,319
my goodness so basically you would like
you'd load up the game you would change

954
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:25,329
you'd load up the game you would change
 

955
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:28,469
you'd load up the game you would change
one setting in the in the schemes or the

956
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:28,479
one setting in the in the schemes or the
 

957
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,209
one setting in the in the schemes or the
teams or whatever then you would load it

958
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:30,219
teams or whatever then you would load it
 

959
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,649
teams or whatever then you would load it
up in the hex editor and see what

960
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:31,659
up in the hex editor and see what
 

961
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,899
up in the hex editor and see what
changed like what byte changed in the

962
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:33,909
changed like what byte changed in the
 

963
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,359
changed like what byte changed in the
file and then you would know okay this

964
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:36,369
file and then you would know okay this
 

965
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,069
file and then you would know okay this
byte here this controls like the worms

966
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:38,079
byte here this controls like the worms
 

967
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,550
byte here this controls like the worms
Hal

968
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:38,560
Hal
 

969
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,670
Hal
this one is how much turn time you have

970
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:41,680
this one is how much turn time you have
 

971
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,670
this one is how much turn time you have
stuff like that right so you have to

972
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:44,680
stuff like that right so you have to
 

973
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,500
stuff like that right so you have to
document the whole file figure out what

974
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,510
document the whole file figure out what
 

975
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,740
document the whole file figure out what
does what and then you have to make an

976
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:49,750
does what and then you have to make an
 

977
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,920
does what and then you have to make an
interface for editing that yeah so for

978
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:52,930
interface for editing that yeah so for
 

979
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,150
interface for editing that yeah so for
most of the projects I did I never

980
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,160
most of the projects I did I never
 

981
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,280
most of the projects I did I never
really tried to like release them

982
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,290
really tried to like release them
 

983
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,870
really tried to like release them
publicly they were just like test

984
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:57,880
publicly they were just like test
 

985
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,050
publicly they were just like test
projects the game experience but I did

986
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,060
projects the game experience but I did
 

987
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,460
projects the game experience but I did
challenge myself a few times to make

988
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,470
challenge myself a few times to make
 

989
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,560
challenge myself a few times to make
like public releases for the the

990
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,570
like public releases for the the
 

991
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,570
like public releases for the the
programs I was making like try to refine

992
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:06,580
programs I was making like try to refine
 

993
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,020
programs I was making like try to refine
them make a nice interface and I get rid

994
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,030
them make a nice interface and I get rid
 

995
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,340
them make a nice interface and I get rid
of all the bugs and stuff for it I

996
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,350
of all the bugs and stuff for it I
 

997
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,430
of all the bugs and stuff for it I
thought that would be good good to learn

998
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,440
thought that would be good good to learn
 

999
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,580
thought that would be good good to learn
as well right so here's a picture of one

1000
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:17,590
as well right so here's a picture of one
 

1001
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,340
as well right so here's a picture of one
of the editors I released publicly like

1002
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,350
of the editors I released publicly like
 

1003
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,290
of the editors I released publicly like
one of the first ones I did and got

1004
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,300
one of the first ones I did and got
 

1005
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,760
one of the first ones I did and got
quite a bit of use actually so that was

1006
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:26,770
quite a bit of use actually so that was
 

1007
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,880
quite a bit of use actually so that was
good and I think later after I kind of

1008
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:29,890
good and I think later after I kind of
 

1009
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,800
good and I think later after I kind of
got tired of making editors I started

1010
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:31,810
got tired of making editors I started
 

1011
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,400
got tired of making editors I started
looking into like how to do online

1012
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,410
looking into like how to do online
 

1013
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,160
looking into like how to do online
programming like how to make servers and

1014
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,170
programming like how to make servers and
 

1015
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,760
programming like how to make servers and
stuff so I figured out how did you pack

1016
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:41,770
stuff so I figured out how did you pack
 

1017
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,430
stuff so I figured out how did you pack
it sniffing I did it first with that

1018
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:44,440
it sniffing I did it first with that
 

1019
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,110
it sniffing I did it first with that
worms game I was playing I I would like

1020
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,120
worms game I was playing I I would like
 

1021
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,650
worms game I was playing I I would like
watch well the incoming and outgoing

1022
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:49,660
watch well the incoming and outgoing
 

1023
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,800
watch well the incoming and outgoing
traffic of the game right and then oh I

1024
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:54,810
traffic of the game right and then oh I
 

1025
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,930
traffic of the game right and then oh I
can't see the glass it's invisible okay

1026
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:57,940
can't see the glass it's invisible okay
 

1027
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,060
can't see the glass it's invisible okay
there we go

1028
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,070
there we go
 

1029
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,160
there we go
so that game was based on like a

1030
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,170
so that game was based on like a
 

1031
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,740
so that game was based on like a
high-bred IRC client so I figured out

1032
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:04,750
high-bred IRC client so I figured out
 

1033
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,980
high-bred IRC client so I figured out
how IRC clients worked and I was trying

1034
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:10,990
how IRC clients worked and I was trying
 

1035
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,540
how IRC clients worked and I was trying
to make my own server for the game right

1036
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:12,550
to make my own server for the game right
 

1037
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,130
to make my own server for the game right
so I could host it myself instead of

1038
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,140
so I could host it myself instead of
 

1039
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,140
so I could host it myself instead of
using the official one so I eventually

1040
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,150
using the official one so I eventually
 

1041
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,860
using the official one so I eventually
was able to do that then later I think I

1042
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:22,870
was able to do that then later I think I
 

1043
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,320
was able to do that then later I think I
moved on to other games I think the next

1044
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,330
moved on to other games I think the next
 

1045
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,230
moved on to other games I think the next
one I did was a MMO game Survival

1046
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
one I did was a MMO game Survival
 

1047
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
one I did was a MMO game Survival
project some of you might have heard of

1048
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,530
project some of you might have heard of
 

1049
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,940
project some of you might have heard of
that and that's when I got into hacking

1050
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:32,950
that and that's when I got into hacking
 

1051
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,620
that and that's when I got into hacking
I hate to say it wasn't always always a

1052
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:37,630
I hate to say it wasn't always always a
 

1053
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,980
I hate to say it wasn't always always a
good guy on the internet although I

1054
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:40,990
good guy on the internet although I
 

1055
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,160
good guy on the internet although I
never I made sure what I did it not to

1056
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,170
never I made sure what I did it not to
 

1057
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,950
never I made sure what I did it not to
interfere with anyone else's enjoyment

1058
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
interfere with anyone else's enjoyment
 

1059
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,900
interfere with anyone else's enjoyment
of the game like I never messed up the

1060
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:48,910
of the game like I never messed up the
 

1061
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,780
of the game like I never messed up the
economy in the game but still probably

1062
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:51,790
economy in the game but still probably
 

1063
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,300
economy in the game but still probably
shouldn't never

1064
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,310
shouldn't never
 

1065
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,270
shouldn't never
done that but yeah that was also some

1066
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,280
done that but yeah that was also some
 

1067
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,950
done that but yeah that was also some
learning experience like I was playing

1068
00:23:59,950 --> 00:23:59,960
learning experience like I was playing
 

1069
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,590
learning experience like I was playing
the game for a long time and it was

1070
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:02,600
the game for a long time and it was
 

1071
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,450
the game for a long time and it was
super grindy right super grindy

1072
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:04,460
super grindy right super grindy
 

1073
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,650
super grindy right super grindy
eventually got tired of grinding out

1074
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:07,660
eventually got tired of grinding out
 

1075
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,620
eventually got tired of grinding out
like the money in the game right people

1076
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,630
like the money in the game right people
 

1077
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,940
like the money in the game right people
in that game would not let you play with

1078
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,950
in that game would not let you play with
 

1079
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,230
in that game would not let you play with
them if you don't have good enough items

1080
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
them if you don't have good enough items
 

1081
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,180
them if you don't have good enough items
either so that really frustrated me like

1082
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,190
either so that really frustrated me like
 

1083
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,260
either so that really frustrated me like
they would just kick you out of the room

1084
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,270
they would just kick you out of the room
 

1085
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,360
they would just kick you out of the room
so I was like you know I'm tired of

1086
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,370
so I was like you know I'm tired of
 

1087
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,720
so I was like you know I'm tired of
grinding all this stuff why don't I just

1088
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:22,730
grinding all this stuff why don't I just
 

1089
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,530
grinding all this stuff why don't I just
try make a program to play for me so I

1090
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:26,540
try make a program to play for me so I
 

1091
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,790
try make a program to play for me so I
ended up doing that and it worked and

1092
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:29,800
ended up doing that and it worked and
 

1093
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,770
ended up doing that and it worked and
the game had what was called n protects

1094
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:32,780
the game had what was called n protects
 

1095
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,700
the game had what was called n protects
which was like to stop memory editors

1096
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:36,710
which was like to stop memory editors
 

1097
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,840
which was like to stop memory editors
from working because that's how most

1098
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:37,850
from working because that's how most
 

1099
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,880
from working because that's how most
people used to hack the game and then

1100
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:39,890
people used to hack the game and then
 

1101
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,260
people used to hack the game and then
nobody was able to do it once they

1102
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,270
nobody was able to do it once they
 

1103
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,070
nobody was able to do it once they
installed that but I made a hack that's

1104
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,080
installed that but I made a hack that's
 

1105
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,830
installed that but I made a hack that's
worked by like intercepting the the

1106
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:50,840
worked by like intercepting the the
 

1107
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,980
worked by like intercepting the the
packets in and out of the game again my

1108
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:53,990
packets in and out of the game again my
 

1109
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,530
packets in and out of the game again my
experience with the making the worm

1110
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:56,540
experience with the making the worm
 

1111
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,210
experience with the making the worm
servers and stuff kind of came into hand

1112
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:58,220
servers and stuff kind of came into hand
 

1113
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,110
servers and stuff kind of came into hand
there um yeah

1114
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,120
there um yeah
 

1115
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,470
there um yeah
anyways eventually you know I got tired

1116
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:05,480
anyways eventually you know I got tired
 

1117
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,900
anyways eventually you know I got tired
of doing that I I did get in contact

1118
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,910
of doing that I I did get in contact
 

1119
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,460
of doing that I I did get in contact
with the developers and told them how to

1120
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,470
with the developers and told them how to
 

1121
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,590
with the developers and told them how to
fix the exploit I was using and stuff

1122
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
fix the exploit I was using and stuff
 

1123
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,930
fix the exploit I was using and stuff
too so I tried to be good about it but

1124
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:13,940
too so I tried to be good about it but
 

1125
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,560
too so I tried to be good about it but
again not the thing to be doing right I

1126
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,570
again not the thing to be doing right I
 

1127
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,610
again not the thing to be doing right I
did work on this side a little bit too

1128
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:18,620
did work on this side a little bit too
 

1129
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,120
did work on this side a little bit too
by the way

1130
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,130
by the way
 

1131
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,520
by the way
uh-huh yeah so after that I did play a

1132
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,530
uh-huh yeah so after that I did play a
 

1133
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,250
uh-huh yeah so after that I did play a
few other online games but I made the

1134
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,260
few other online games but I made the
 

1135
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,410
few other online games but I made the
rule for myself not to hack them anymore

1136
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:26,420
rule for myself not to hack them anymore
 

1137
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,180
rule for myself not to hack them anymore
even though I was really tempted a few

1138
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,190
even though I was really tempted a few
 

1139
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,600
even though I was really tempted a few
times so I didn't do a whole lot of

1140
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,610
times so I didn't do a whole lot of
 

1141
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,420
times so I didn't do a whole lot of
programming after that just odd random

1142
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,430
programming after that just odd random
 

1143
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,550
programming after that just odd random
project I kind of realized at that point

1144
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:36,560
project I kind of realized at that point
 

1145
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,590
project I kind of realized at that point
like ice little older that maybe making

1146
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:38,600
like ice little older that maybe making
 

1147
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,270
like ice little older that maybe making
games wasn't gonna be the most staple of

1148
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,280
games wasn't gonna be the most staple of
 

1149
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,580
games wasn't gonna be the most staple of
careers either so I was mostly just

1150
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,590
careers either so I was mostly just
 

1151
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,320
careers either so I was mostly just
programming for fun at that point it was

1152
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,330
programming for fun at that point it was
 

1153
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,940
programming for fun at that point it was
funny though like people from the old

1154
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:48,950
funny though like people from the old
 

1155
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,560
funny though like people from the old
game I used to play that I hacked to it

1156
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:50,570
game I used to play that I hacked to it
 

1157
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,660
game I used to play that I hacked to it
like contact me and the new games I was

1158
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:52,670
like contact me and the new games I was
 

1159
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,790
like contact me and the new games I was
playing and is like alrighty so are you

1160
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:54,800
playing and is like alrighty so are you
 

1161
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,020
playing and is like alrighty so are you
gonna you're gonna hook me up with those

1162
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,030
gonna you're gonna hook me up with those
 

1163
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,170
gonna you're gonna hook me up with those
hacks when you make them I was like no

1164
00:25:59,170 --> 00:25:59,180
hacks when you make them I was like no
 

1165
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,120
hacks when you make them I was like no
I'm not gonna do that anymore as I go

1166
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,130
I'm not gonna do that anymore as I go
 

1167
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm not gonna do that anymore as I go
are you sure

1168
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,370
are you sure
 

1169
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,700
are you sure
like yeah but yeah I think what I did I

1170
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:07,710
like yeah but yeah I think what I did I
 

1171
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,399
like yeah but yeah I think what I did I
did make one program for another online

1172
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:10,409
did make one program for another online
 

1173
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:13,010
did make one program for another online
game though it wasn't a hack it was an

1174
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,020
game though it wasn't a hack it was an
 

1175
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,130
game though it wasn't a hack it was an
analytical program where I don't know if

1176
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,140
analytical program where I don't know if
 

1177
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,960
analytical program where I don't know if
any of you've heard of starport GE but

1178
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:17,970
any of you've heard of starport GE but
 

1179
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,060
any of you've heard of starport GE but
that's like a colony management sort of

1180
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,070
that's like a colony management sort of
 

1181
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,240
that's like a colony management sort of
game um and there's a bit of space

1182
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,250
game um and there's a bit of space
 

1183
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,580
game um and there's a bit of space
fighting and stuff in that too big part

1184
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,590
fighting and stuff in that too big part
 

1185
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,049
fighting and stuff in that too big part
of it is called any management though

1186
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:27,059
of it is called any management though
 

1187
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,159
of it is called any management though
and there's like eight or ten different

1188
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:28,169
and there's like eight or ten different
 

1189
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,350
and there's like eight or ten different
settings for the colonies like how much

1190
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,360
settings for the colonies like how much
 

1191
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,820
settings for the colonies like how much
food you would produce morale-boosting

1192
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:33,830
food you would produce morale-boosting
 

1193
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,330
food you would produce morale-boosting
mining weapon production security

1194
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,340
mining weapon production security
 

1195
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,590
mining weapon production security
pollution clearing stuff like that right

1196
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
pollution clearing stuff like that right
 

1197
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,139
pollution clearing stuff like that right
and the colonies were very finicky in

1198
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:42,149
and the colonies were very finicky in
 

1199
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:45,230
and the colonies were very finicky in
that game if you set anything a little

1200
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,240
that game if you set anything a little
 

1201
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,419
that game if you set anything a little
bit too high would exponentially like

1202
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:47,429
bit too high would exponentially like
 

1203
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,080
bit too high would exponentially like
grow out of control and kill itself if

1204
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,090
grow out of control and kill itself if
 

1205
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,159
grow out of control and kill itself if
you set it too low then your colony

1206
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:55,169
you set it too low then your colony
 

1207
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,560
you set it too low then your colony
would be really easy to steal so people

1208
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:57,570
would be really easy to steal so people
 

1209
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,519
would be really easy to steal so people
would just steal it from you right so I

1210
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:00,529
would just steal it from you right so I
 

1211
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,779
would just steal it from you right so I
managed to figure out the formula the

1212
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:02,789
managed to figure out the formula the
 

1213
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,130
managed to figure out the formula the
game used like the math formula for all

1214
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,140
game used like the math formula for all
 

1215
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,360
game used like the math formula for all
the different settings and then I wrote

1216
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,370
the different settings and then I wrote
 

1217
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,820
the different settings and then I wrote
a program that would tell me like the

1218
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:10,830
a program that would tell me like the
 

1219
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,659
a program that would tell me like the
perfect settings to like maximize the

1220
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:13,669
perfect settings to like maximize the
 

1221
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,810
perfect settings to like maximize the
population of the colony without it

1222
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:16,820
population of the colony without it
 

1223
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,029
population of the colony without it
having any trouble right and like in

1224
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:20,039
having any trouble right and like in
 

1225
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,970
having any trouble right and like in
that game what we're doing here maybe

1226
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:25,980
that game what we're doing here maybe
 

1227
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,730
that game what we're doing here maybe
put this over here in that game there

1228
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:28,740
put this over here in that game there
 

1229
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,399
put this over here in that game there
would be like these groups of people

1230
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:30,409
would be like these groups of people
 

1231
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:34,669
would be like these groups of people
with like five or ten people and their

1232
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:34,679
with like five or ten people and their
 

1233
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,409
with like five or ten people and their
culture in their group right and they

1234
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:36,419
culture in their group right and they
 

1235
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,419
culture in their group right and they
were just barely managing their empires

1236
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:38,429
were just barely managing their empires
 

1237
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,710
were just barely managing their empires
and meanwhile I was like on my own with

1238
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
and meanwhile I was like on my own with
 

1239
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
and meanwhile I was like on my own with
the bigger empires in like these five or

1240
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:44,730
the bigger empires in like these five or
 

1241
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,880
the bigger empires in like these five or
ten people and they were like how are

1242
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:46,890
ten people and they were like how are
 

1243
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,580
ten people and they were like how are
you doing this what's going on so then I

1244
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,590
you doing this what's going on so then I
 

1245
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,669
you doing this what's going on so then I
would tell them and then they would be

1246
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:52,679
would tell them and then they would be
 

1247
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,130
would tell them and then they would be
like oh really

1248
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,140
like oh really
 

1249
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,460
like oh really

that was kind of kind of interesting

1264
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:14,610
that was kind of kind of interesting
 

1265
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,850
that was kind of kind of interesting
so I did that and I played that game for

1266
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:16,860
so I did that and I played that game for
 

1267
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,960
so I did that and I played that game for
about a year or two then I think it was

1268
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:20,970
about a year or two then I think it was
 

1269
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,240
about a year or two then I think it was
like when the xbox360 came out that's

1270
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,250
like when the xbox360 came out that's
 

1271
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,850
like when the xbox360 came out that's
when Microsoft released the XNA

1272
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:25,860
when Microsoft released the XNA
 

1273
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,039
when Microsoft released the XNA
framework which any of you are familiar

1274
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,049
framework which any of you are familiar
 

1275
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:29,720
framework which any of you are familiar
with like unity or something like that

1276
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:29,730
with like unity or something like that
 

1277
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,519
with like unity or something like that
it's a it's a framework for making games

1278
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:31,529
it's a it's a framework for making games
 

1279
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:34,669
it's a it's a framework for making games
and they it was actually possible to

1280
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:34,679
and they it was actually possible to
 

1281
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,620
and they it was actually possible to
sell them on the Xbox Marketplace as

1282
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:36,630
sell them on the Xbox Marketplace as
 

1283
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,259
sell them on the Xbox Marketplace as
well so that's when I really started to

1284
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:39,269
well so that's when I really started to
 

1285
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:41,000
well so that's when I really started to
think started thinking like hey maybe I

1286
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,010
think started thinking like hey maybe I
 

1287
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,399
think started thinking like hey maybe I
actually can make games for a living so

1288
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:43,409
actually can make games for a living so
 

1289
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:44,930
actually can make games for a living so
I started prototyping a bunch of games

1290
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:44,940
I started prototyping a bunch of games
 

1291
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,299
I started prototyping a bunch of games
than that that was when I moved on to

1292
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:47,309
than that that was when I moved on to
 

1293
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,269
than that that was when I moved on to
c-sharp as a programming language the

1294
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:50,279
c-sharp as a programming language the
 

1295
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,070
c-sharp as a programming language the
main problem I had was that those I had

1296
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
main problem I had was that those I had
 

1297
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,230
main problem I had was that those I had
a lot of trouble like focusing on idea I

1298
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
a lot of trouble like focusing on idea I
 

1299
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,029
a lot of trouble like focusing on idea I
would I would prototype one game idea

1300
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:56,039
would I would prototype one game idea
 

1301
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,320
would I would prototype one game idea
I'd work on it for a bit and then I'd

1302
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,330
I'd work on it for a bit and then I'd
 

1303
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,940
I'd work on it for a bit and then I'd
get a new idea and I'd move on to that

1304
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:58,950
get a new idea and I'd move on to that
 

1305
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,759
get a new idea and I'd move on to that
and I did that a bunch of times I

1306
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:01,769
and I did that a bunch of times I
 

1307
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,700
and I did that a bunch of times I
couldn't finish a project oh my goodness

1308
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:04,710
couldn't finish a project oh my goodness
 

1309
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,779
couldn't finish a project oh my goodness
when has that ever happened right and

1310
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:07,789
when has that ever happened right and
 

1311
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,460
when has that ever happened right and
funny enough like one of my prototypes

1312
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,470
funny enough like one of my prototypes
 

1313
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,830
funny enough like one of my prototypes
was a twin stick shooter with like a

1314
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:12,840
was a twin stick shooter with like a
 

1315
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,740
was a twin stick shooter with like a
Zelda style to it like where you would

1316
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:15,750
Zelda style to it like where you would
 

1317
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,019
Zelda style to it like where you would
switch screens and you get a new wave of

1318
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:18,029
switch screens and you get a new wave of
 

1319
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,000
switch screens and you get a new wave of
enemies like at that time a lot of the

1320
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,010
enemies like at that time a lot of the
 

1321
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,769
enemies like at that time a lot of the
twin stick shooters would just

1322
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:21,779
twin stick shooters would just
 

1323
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,870
twin stick shooters would just
constantly send new enemies at you all

1324
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:23,880
constantly send new enemies at you all
 

1325
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,700
constantly send new enemies at you all
right I had the idea like man it would

1326
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:25,710
right I had the idea like man it would
 

1327
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,009
right I had the idea like man it would
be a lot better if you just like switch

1328
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:28,019
be a lot better if you just like switch
 

1329
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,990
be a lot better if you just like switch
screens and there'd be a whole bunch of

1330
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
screens and there'd be a whole bunch of
 

1331
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,730
screens and there'd be a whole bunch of
new enemies there and then you'd have

1332
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:31,740
new enemies there and then you'd have
 

1333
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,500
new enemies there and then you'd have
like an exploration aspect of the game

1334
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:33,510
like an exploration aspect of the game
 

1335
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,129
like an exploration aspect of the game
too right um almost a little bit like

1336
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:37,139
too right um almost a little bit like
 

1337
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:38,899
too right um almost a little bit like
binding of issac which came out two or

1338
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:38,909
binding of issac which came out two or
 

1339
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,419
binding of issac which came out two or
three years after I had that idea so

1340
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:41,429
three years after I had that idea so
 

1341
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,039
three years after I had that idea so
maybe if I just focused on it I could

1342
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,049
maybe if I just focused on it I could
 

1343
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,659
maybe if I just focused on it I could
have actually had a successful game you

1344
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:44,669
have actually had a successful game you
 

1345
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:45,980
have actually had a successful game you
know but I didn't think it was that good

1346
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:45,990
know but I didn't think it was that good
 

1347
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,750
know but I didn't think it was that good
of an idea at the time another game I

1348
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:50,760
of an idea at the time another game I
 

1349
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,850
of an idea at the time another game I
made that was very similar to Mario

1350
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:52,860
made that was very similar to Mario
 

1351
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,560
made that was very similar to Mario
maker as well I was like the last one I

1352
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:54,570
maker as well I was like the last one I
 

1353
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,159
maker as well I was like the last one I
was working on before I start youtube

1354
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:57,169
was working on before I start youtube
 

1355
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,840
was working on before I start youtube
and then when I started youtube I didn't

1356
00:29:59,840 --> 00:29:59,850
and then when I started youtube I didn't
 

1357
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,980
and then when I started youtube I didn't
really do any programming because I

1358
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:00,990
really do any programming because I
 

1359
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,620
really do any programming because I
didn't have any time so that's sort of

1360
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:03,630
didn't have any time so that's sort of
 

1361
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,009
didn't have any time so that's sort of
where my programming ended uh-huh but

1362
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:07,019
where my programming ended uh-huh but
 

1363
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,870
where my programming ended uh-huh but
anyway story time with ethos over guys

1364
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
anyway story time with ethos over guys

you can wake up now

1366
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:09,809
you can wake up now

oh you got to finish up this episode I

1368
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
oh you got to finish up this episode I
 

1369
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
oh you got to finish up this episode I
might have rambled a little too long

1370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,010
might have rambled a little too long
 

1371
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,440
might have rambled a little too long
there it's it's actually getting pretty

1372
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,450
there it's it's actually getting pretty
 

1373
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,899
there it's it's actually getting pretty
long so I did the rest of this off

1374
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:17,909
long so I did the rest of this off
 

1375
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:22,730
long so I did the rest of this off
camera just to speed it up and got

1376
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:22,740
camera just to speed it up and got
 

1377
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,409
camera just to speed it up and got
pretty much all of it done had a couple

1378
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
pretty much all of it done had a couple
 

1379
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:25,870
pretty much all of it done had a couple
snags here I'll show you

1380
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:25,880
snags here I'll show you
 

1381
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,620
snags here I'll show you
but let's

1382
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:28,630
but let's
 

1383
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,480
but let's
let's get into this over here first stop

1384
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,490
let's get into this over here first stop
 

1385
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,900
let's get into this over here first stop
so it feels pretty good to me again it

1386
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:34,910
so it feels pretty good to me again it
 

1387
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,430
so it feels pretty good to me again it
kind of stands out cuz it doesn't match

1388
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:36,440
kind of stands out cuz it doesn't match

over this probably you I'll probably
 

1395
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,500
over this probably you I'll probably
just put glass above this though either

1396
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:44,510
just put glass above this though either
 

1397
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,770
just put glass above this though either
flat glass or like dome shaped glass I'm

1398

flat glass or like dome shaped glass I'm
 

1399
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,980
flat glass or like dome shaped glass I'm
thinking I added a window up there for

1400
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:50,990
thinking I added a window up there for
 

1401
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,440
thinking I added a window up there for
the second-story we got to add a way of

the second-story we got to add a way of
 

1403
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,029
the second-story we got to add a way of
getting up to the second story and again

1404
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
getting up to the second story and again
 

1405

there's not enough space so what I

1408
00:30:59,620 --> 00:30:59,630
there's not enough space so what I
 

1409

there's not enough space so what I
decided to do I just frame this in with

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:20,659
want to wash away your redstone so dig
 

1425

want to wash away your redstone so dig
this out a trapdoor will hold it right

1426
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:23,690
this out a trapdoor will hold it right
 

1427
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:30,370
this out a trapdoor will hold it right
where am I wrong about that let's go

1428
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,380
where am I wrong about that let's go
 

1429
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,930
where am I wrong about that let's go
over here

1430
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:30,940
over here
 

1431
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:37,240
over here
yeah it's holding it okay good yeah so I

1432
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,250
yeah it's holding it okay good yeah so I
 

1433
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,140
yeah it's holding it okay good yeah so I
don't think us up to the second floor

1434
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,150
don't think us up to the second floor
 

1435
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,350
don't think us up to the second floor
here and then we'll add another one on

1436
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
here and then we'll add another one on
 

1437
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,930
here and then we'll add another one on
this side oh and you know what that

1438
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:43,940
this side oh and you know what that
 

1439
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,460
this side oh and you know what that
doesn't look that bad either having the

1440
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,470
doesn't look that bad either having the
 

1441
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,520
doesn't look that bad either having the
bubble streams there it's kind of a cool

1442
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,530
bubble streams there it's kind of a cool
 

1443
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,409
bubble streams there it's kind of a cool
effect we got glass on this side so we

1444
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:50,419
effect we got glass on this side so we
 

1445
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:54,460
effect we got glass on this side so we
can see the the water from here too so

1446
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:54,470
can see the the water from here too so
 

1447
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,370
can see the the water from here too so
that's cool I like that so easy to get

1448
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:57,380
that's cool I like that so easy to get
 

1449
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,029
that's cool I like that so easy to get
to the second floor here it's a little

1450
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
to the second floor here it's a little
 

1451
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,380
to the second floor here it's a little
bit awkward because again we do have

1452
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,390
bit awkward because again we do have
 

1453
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,850
bit awkward because again we do have
that wire running across here but I

1454
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:03,860
that wire running across here but I
 

1455
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,340
that wire running across here but I
tried to hide it as it was I could

1456
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,350
tried to hide it as it was I could
 

1457
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,899
tried to hide it as it was I could
actually let's just add this over top to

1458
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:07,909
actually let's just add this over top to
 

1459
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:12,039
actually let's just add this over top to
you yeah we can look down over here

1460
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,049
you yeah we can look down over here
 

1461
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:14,440
you yeah we can look down over here
through the window and the roof in this

1462
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,450
through the window and the roof in this
 

1463
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,659
through the window and the roof in this
is not complete so I didn't bother

1464
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:16,669
is not complete so I didn't bother
 

1465
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,370
is not complete so I didn't bother
trying to connect the top of this to it

1466
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:18,380
trying to connect the top of this to it
 

1467
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,919
trying to connect the top of this to it
yet that's another another step of this

1468
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:20,929
yet that's another another step of this
 

1469
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:23,260
yet that's another another step of this
I need to do now we have a way down over

1470
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,270
I need to do now we have a way down over
 

1471
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,260
I need to do now we have a way down over
here so the big trouble with this build

1472
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,270
here so the big trouble with this build
 

1473
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,580
here so the big trouble with this build
that I ran into is on the other side

1474
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:29,590
that I ran into is on the other side
 

1475
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,380
that I ran into is on the other side
pretty much tried to mirror it exactly

1476
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,390
pretty much tried to mirror it exactly
 

1477
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,720
pretty much tried to mirror it exactly
but I ran into a couple things we have

1478
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:34,730
but I ran into a couple things we have
 

1479
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,299
but I ran into a couple things we have
an item elevator here we can rip this

1480
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:37,309
an item elevator here we can rip this
 

1481
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,830
an item elevator here we can rip this
out and replace it with a bubble stream

1482
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:38,840
out and replace it with a bubble stream
 

1483
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,490
out and replace it with a bubble stream
so that's not a huge deal

1484
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:41,500
so that's not a huge deal
 

1485
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,190
so that's not a huge deal
this is our line where anything that

1486
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,200
this is our line where anything that
 

1487
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,230
this is our line where anything that
doesn't get sorted it's shot out here

1488
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,240
doesn't get sorted it's shot out here
 

1489
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,550
doesn't get sorted it's shot out here
and there was like an ice cream that

1490
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:47,560
and there was like an ice cream that
 

1491
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,860
and there was like an ice cream that
went through this whole thing that I

1492
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:49,870
went through this whole thing that I
 

1493
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,840
went through this whole thing that I
ripped out so this needs to end

1494
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:51,850
ripped out so this needs to end
 

1495
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,890
ripped out so this needs to end
somewhere else and what else did we run

1496
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:55,900
somewhere else and what else did we run
 

1497
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,110
somewhere else and what else did we run
into Oh up over there there's like a

1498
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,120
into Oh up over there there's like a
 

1499
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,450
into Oh up over there there's like a
gizmo that got in the way of my build so

1500
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:00,460
gizmo that got in the way of my build so
 

1501
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,550
gizmo that got in the way of my build so
I'll have to move that and right over

1502
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:02,560
I'll have to move that and right over
 

1503
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,200
I'll have to move that and right over
here there's wiring where I want to put

1504
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,210
here there's wiring where I want to put
 

1505
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,750
here there's wiring where I want to put
the elevator I don't know if I can get

1506
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:06,760
the elevator I don't know if I can get
 

1507
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,880
the elevator I don't know if I can get
rid of that we can do it on this side at

1508
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:08,890
rid of that we can do it on this side at
 

1509
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,240
rid of that we can do it on this side at
the very least which is good we'll add

1510
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,250
the very least which is good we'll add
 

1511
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:22,410
the very least which is good we'll add
one in here as well cool cool and again

1512
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:22,420
one in here as well cool cool and again
 

1513
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,470
one in here as well cool cool and again
this side needs a roof as well we made

1514
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:25,480
this side needs a roof as well we made
 

1515
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,900
this side needs a roof as well we made
some good progress on this pretty happy

1516
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:27,910
some good progress on this pretty happy
 

1517
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,280
some good progress on this pretty happy
with that

1518
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,290
with that
 

1519
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,530
with that
so I might also try to like put a glass

1520
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:31,540
so I might also try to like put a glass
 

1521
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,350
so I might also try to like put a glass
dome over the wiring here this is all

1522
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,360
dome over the wiring here this is all
 

1523
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,950
dome over the wiring here this is all
open right now

1524
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
open right now
 

1525
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,280
open right now
so yeah there's there's a little bit

1526
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,290
so yeah there's there's a little bit
 

1527
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,020
so yeah there's there's a little bit
left to do with this but we did pretty

1528
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,030
left to do with this but we did pretty
 

1529
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,750

stuff to deal with too we probably

1532
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,100
stuff to deal with too we probably
 

1533
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,530
stuff to deal with too we probably
should cover that up it doesn't look the

1534
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:48,540
should cover that up it doesn't look the
 

1535
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,020
should cover that up it doesn't look the
best but this is what the side of the

1536
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,030
best but this is what the side of the
 

1537
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,010
best but this is what the side of the
building looks like I don't think I

1538
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,020
building looks like I don't think I
 

1539
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,620
building looks like I don't think I
showed it actually but yeah let's get to

1540
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,630
showed it actually but yeah let's get to
 

1541
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,420
showed it actually but yeah let's get to

on YouTube or posting videos targeted at

1558
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:19,620
on YouTube or posting videos targeted at
 

1559
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,960
on YouTube or posting videos targeted at
children and then they were putting like

1560
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,970
children and then they were putting like
 

1561
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,960
children and then they were putting like
adult content and I believe and kids

1562
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:23,970
adult content and I believe and kids
 

1563
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,330
adult content and I believe and kids
were watching that so I believe they

1564
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:26,340
were watching that so I believe they
 

1565
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,910
were watching that so I believe they
enacted a law in the u.s. to make that

1566
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:28,920
enacted a law in the u.s. to make that
 

1567
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,800
enacted a law in the u.s. to make that
illegal up to a forty two thousand

1568
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:30,810
illegal up to a forty two thousand
 

1569
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,860
illegal up to a forty two thousand
dollar fine I think per video even so if

1570
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:33,870
dollar fine I think per video even so if
 

1571
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,350
dollar fine I think per video even so if
you have a couple thousand videos is

1572
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:36,360
you have a couple thousand videos is
 

1573
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,650
you have a couple thousand videos is

single video of mine got hit with that I

1578
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:44,910
single video of mine got hit with that I
 

1579
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,680
single video of mine got hit with that I
would definitely be bankrupt but for

1580
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:48,690
would definitely be bankrupt but for
 

1581
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,630
would definitely be bankrupt but for
many reasons I don't think I will be

1582
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:50,640
many reasons I don't think I will be
 

1583
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,730
many reasons I don't think I will be
affected by this at all so for one thing

1584
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:55,740
affected by this at all so for one thing
 

1585
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,370
affected by this at all so for one thing
that's a US law and Canadian my videos

1586
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:58,380
that's a US law and Canadian my videos
 

1587
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,390
that's a US law and Canadian my videos
were made before this was enacted the

1588
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
were made before this was enacted the
 

1589
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,670
were made before this was enacted the
big thing though is I have set all my

1590
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:04,680
big thing though is I have set all my
 

1591
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,520
big thing though is I have set all my
videos to not targeted at children

1592
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:06,530
videos to not targeted at children
 

1593
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:12,710
videos to not targeted at children
