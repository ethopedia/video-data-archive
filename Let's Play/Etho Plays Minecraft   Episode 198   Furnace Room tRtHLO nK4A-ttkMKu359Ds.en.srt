00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
then half slab half slab
 

127
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,509
then half slab half slab
um then the fence would come around like

128
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
um then the fence would come around like
 

129
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,070
um then the fence would come around like
that

130
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
that
 

131
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,670
that
with that

132
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680

135
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,750

i could do it like one here

136
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
i could do it like one here
 

137
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,830
i could do it like one here
and one here as well but that might be

138
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
and one here as well but that might be
 

139
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,710
and one here as well but that might be
too many arches

140
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
too many arches
 

141
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,869
too many arches

145
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,910

and then i would duplicate this effect

146
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
and then i would duplicate this effect
 

147
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,750
and then i would duplicate this effect
as well probably

148
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760

 

149
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,110

154
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
maybe i'll try it i'll put four of them
 

155
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,550

i'll put one for here and one for here
 

157
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,589

175
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,990
looks better than i thought it would
especially this one here is good

176
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
especially this one here is good
 

177
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,070
especially this one here is good
for the furnace room it's it's not as

178
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
for the furnace room it's it's not as
 

179
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,909
for the furnace room it's it's not as
wide as this one or

180
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
wide as this one or
 

181
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,150
wide as this one or
this one um i tried it for this side as

182
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
this one um i tried it for this side as
 

183
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,670
this one um i tried it for this side as
well but i don't like that

184
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
well but i don't like that
 

185
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,870
well but i don't like that
so it's just too much especially looks

186
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
so it's just too much especially looks
 

187
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,749
so it's just too much especially looks
weird from

188
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
weird from
 

189
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,350
weird from
here so we're going to take that out

190
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
here so we're going to take that out
 

191
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,030
here so we're going to take that out
but for the furnace room i think i'll

192
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
but for the furnace room i think i'll
 

193
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,830
but for the furnace room i think i'll
keep that

194
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840

 

195
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,030

although like with this one just having

196
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
although like with this one just having
 

197
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,749
although like with this one just having
a single wide one looks pretty good

198
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759

 

199
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,590

maybe yeah i'll just put it back to how

200
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
maybe yeah i'll just put it back to how
 

201
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,189
maybe yeah i'll just put it back to how
it was here

202
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199

 

203
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,870

get our fences

204
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880

 

205
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,469

so i i think that looks good coming back

206
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
so i i think that looks good coming back
 

207
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,469
so i i think that looks good coming back
it's not too enclosed

208

209
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,150

and then i could do something with the

210
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
and then i could do something with the
 

211
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,629
and then i could do something with the
ceiling here pretty easily because it's

212
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
ceiling here pretty easily because it's
 

213
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,909
ceiling here pretty easily because it's
it's got four sides then to work with

214
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
it's got four sides then to work with
 

215
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,590
it's got four sides then to work with
um what i wanted to try is maybe

216
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600

 

217
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,469

like the supports pillars for the arches

00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479

i wonder how it'll look if i changed it

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
i wonder how it'll look if i changed it
 

223
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,710

the only thing i know about it is i
wanted a window

wanted a window
 

255
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,790

put that in long ago i don't know why

put that in long ago i don't know why
 

257

but i just want a window there

just like that 3x3

just like that 3x3
 

261
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,950
just like that 3x3
so that's one thing we've got to keep it

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,270
in it
i'll probably expand it a little bit

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
i'll probably expand it a little bit
 

267
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,870
i'll probably expand it a little bit
further this way and

further this way and
 

269
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,029
further this way and
this way and since it's a furnace room

270
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
this way and since it's a furnace room
 

271
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,909
this way and since it's a furnace room
it should be built out of stone

272
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
it should be built out of stone
 

273
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,110
it should be built out of stone

then we will start figuring out what

then we will start figuring out what
 

281
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,350
then we will start figuring out what
we're gonna do all right guys

really don't i think between

really don't i think between
 

295
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,790
really don't i think between
8 and 16 is ideal anything beyond that

8 and 16 is ideal anything beyond that

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,189
8 and 16 is ideal anything beyond that
you probably won't use them anyway and

298
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
you probably won't use them anyway and

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,629
i wouldn't want to look at that all the
time

344
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
time
 

345
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,990
time
um anyway

346
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
um anyway
 

347
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,110
um anyway
yeah the furnaces will probably go

348
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
yeah the furnaces will probably go
 

349
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,230
yeah the furnaces will probably go
on this wall and this wall and this wall

350
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
on this wall and this wall and this wall
 

351
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,150
on this wall and this wall and this wall
i'll leave

352
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
i'll leave
 

353
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,070
i'll leave
open or i'll put chests here with blaze

354
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
open or i'll put chests here with blaze
 

355
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,150
open or i'll put chests here with blaze
rods in or something

356
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
rods in or something
 

357
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,230
rods in or something
but i have hit the storage room area i

358
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
but i have hit the storage room area i
 

359
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,509
but i have hit the storage room area i
forgot about this

360
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
forgot about this
 

361
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,829
forgot about this
i'll have to take that into

362
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
i'll have to take that into
 

363
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,430
i'll have to take that into
consideration when building i can't get

364
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
consideration when building i can't get
 

365
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,909
consideration when building i can't get
too close to it

366
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
too close to it
 

367
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,990
too close to it
so the furnaces probably start

368
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
so the furnaces probably start
 

369
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,750
so the furnaces probably start
either here or here

370
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760

 

371
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,150

now i was hoping to include redstone

372
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
now i was hoping to include redstone
 

373
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,190
now i was hoping to include redstone
into this project

374
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
into this project
 

375
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,829
into this project
somehow just to make it more fun and

376
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
somehow just to make it more fun and
 

377
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,990
somehow just to make it more fun and
flashy

378
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
flashy
 

379
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,870
flashy
always makes it more interesting i was

380
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
always makes it more interesting i was
 

381
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,910
always makes it more interesting i was
going to

382
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
going to
 

383
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,949
going to
reconsidering making a shutter system

384
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
reconsidering making a shutter system
 

385
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,750
reconsidering making a shutter system
for the furnaces similar to this

386
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
for the furnaces similar to this
 

387
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,710
for the furnaces similar to this
that's one possibility another thing i'm

388
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
that's one possibility another thing i'm
 

389
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,150
that's one possibility another thing i'm
most likely going to do is this gimmicky

390
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
most likely going to do is this gimmicky
 

391
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,550
most likely going to do is this gimmicky
thing here where

392
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
thing here where
 

393
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,389
thing here where
when the furnaces turn on the lights go

394
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
when the furnaces turn on the lights go
 

395
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,829
when the furnaces turn on the lights go
on

396
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
on
 

397
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,150
on
uh no blocks play and when they're done

398
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
uh no blocks play and when they're done
 

399
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,070
uh no blocks play and when they're done
lights go off and no blocks play again

400
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
lights go off and no blocks play again
 

401
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,509
lights go off and no blocks play again
type thing

402
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
type thing
 

403
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,949
type thing
give you a little indicator signal of

404
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
give you a little indicator signal of
 

405
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,150
give you a little indicator signal of
when

406
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
when
 

407
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,350
when
the furnaces are done clicking

408
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
the furnaces are done clicking
 

409
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,389
the furnaces are done clicking
um so let's go let's go see how we have

410
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
um so let's go let's go see how we have
 

411
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,350
um so let's go let's go see how we have
to rig that up

412
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
to rig that up
 

413
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,030
to rig that up
we'll go to the old grass patch

414
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
we'll go to the old grass patch
 

415
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,829
we'll go to the old grass patch
where i do most of my testing

416
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
where i do most of my testing
 

417
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,750
where i do most of my testing
if i can find it there it is

418
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760

 

419
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,949

all right

420
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959

 

421
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,350

well let's do it over here you like my

422
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
well let's do it over here you like my
 

423
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,190
well let's do it over here you like my
canopy

424
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
canopy
 

425
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,389
canopy
oh yeah um

426
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399

 

427
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,550

yeah so we'll have our furnace

428
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560

 

429
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,470

and then we will oh you know what i

430
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
and then we will oh you know what i
 

431
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,910
and then we will oh you know what i
forgot it's pistons

432
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920

 

433
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,190

those are all regular is there a slime

434
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
those are all regular is there a slime
 

435
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,150
those are all regular is there a slime
ball in one of these

436
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
ball in one of these
 

437
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,750
ball in one of these
chests

438
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760

 

439
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,350

nope okay i'm gonna have to cut it

440
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
nope okay i'm gonna have to cut it
 

441
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,150
nope okay i'm gonna have to cut it
all right i got him let's do it you've

442
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
all right i got him let's do it you've
 

443
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,069
all right i got him let's do it you've
probably seen something like this before

444
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
probably seen something like this before
 

445
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,910
probably seen something like this before
or exactly this even where you have the

446
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
or exactly this even where you have the
 

447
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,829
or exactly this even where you have the
t-flip-flop bud switch behind the

448
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
t-flip-flop bud switch behind the
 

449
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,590
t-flip-flop bud switch behind the
furnace

450
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
furnace
 

451
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,030
furnace
torch there that's

452
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
torch there that's
 

453
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,269
torch there that's
and then we need some redstone

454
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279

 

455
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,550

there there

456
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
there there
 

457
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,150
there there
another torch

458
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160

 

459
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,150

mist there we go

460
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160

 

461
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,590

this comes back uh torch sends power to

462
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
this comes back uh torch sends power to
 

463
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,949
this comes back uh torch sends power to
up here

464
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959

 

465
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,509

and i think you do it like this you have

466
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
and i think you do it like this you have
 

467
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,949
and i think you do it like this you have
a repeater

468
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959

 

469
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,750

uh two blocks up and you need

470
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
uh two blocks up and you need
 

471
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,790
uh two blocks up and you need
redstone i think i have the exact same

472
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
redstone i think i have the exact same
 

473
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,030
redstone i think i have the exact same
type of t-flip flop or t-bud or

474
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
type of t-flip flop or t-bud or
 

475
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,829
type of t-flip flop or t-bud or
bud flop whatever they're called in my

476
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
bud flop whatever they're called in my
 

477
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,750
bud flop whatever they're called in my
jukebox setup

478
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
jukebox setup
 

479
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,030
jukebox setup
and so if you updates the bud switch

480
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
and so if you updates the bud switch
 

481
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,990
and so if you updates the bud switch
such as when the

482
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
such as when the
 

483
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,069
such as when the
furnace turns on and off

484
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079

 

485
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,509

now let's get yeah we want an indicator

486
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
now let's get yeah we want an indicator
 

487
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,069
now let's get yeah we want an indicator
light above the furnace right above it

488
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
light above the furnace right above it
 

489
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,870
light above the furnace right above it
if possible so we'll put it there

490
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
if possible so we'll put it there
 

491
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,150
if possible so we'll put it there
and i think we'll have to run that down

492
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160

 

493
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,910

okay so now like

494
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920

 

495
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,829

the furnace turns on light comes on

496
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
the furnace turns on light comes on
 

497
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,870
the furnace turns on light comes on
goes off it goes off

498
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
goes off it goes off
 

499
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,470
goes off it goes off
so i'm going to put that behind every

500
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
so i'm going to put that behind every
 

501
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,949
so i'm going to put that behind every
furnace the thing is

502
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
furnace the thing is
 

503
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,110
furnace the thing is
we can't put them side by side if we do

504
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
we can't put them side by side if we do
 

505
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,990
we can't put them side by side if we do
this

506
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
this
 

507
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,990
this
with this setup i'm sure there's ways of

508
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
with this setup i'm sure there's ways of
 

509
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,190
with this setup i'm sure there's ways of
doing it um

510
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
doing it um
 

511
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,350
doing it um
i bet you some grass just grew or died

512
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
i bet you some grass just grew or died
 

513
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,550
i bet you some grass just grew or died
there

514
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
there
 

515
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,150
there
um but yeah we'll just have furnaces

516
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
um but yeah we'll just have furnaces
 

517
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,230
um but yeah we'll just have furnaces
side by side

518
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
side by side
 

519
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,230
side by side
maybe four on one wall and four on

520
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
maybe four on one wall and four on
 

521
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,509
maybe four on one wall and four on
another that way we can have eights

522
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
another that way we can have eights
 

523
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,069
another that way we can have eights
and it should be pretty good

524
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079

 

525
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,389

yeah so with this setup with the storage

526
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
yeah so with this setup with the storage
 

527
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,829
yeah so with this setup with the storage
room there i think the closest we can

528
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
room there i think the closest we can
 

529
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,310
room there i think the closest we can
have the furnace to this right wall

530
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
have the furnace to this right wall
 

531
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,269
have the furnace to this right wall
is over here although i do want to check

532
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
is over here although i do want to check
 

533
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,389
is over here although i do want to check
above

534
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
above
 

535
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,670
above
if we're doing these uh t flip flop

536
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
if we're doing these uh t flip flop
 

537
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,030
if we're doing these uh t flip flop
okay uh maybe this is the closest we can

538
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
okay uh maybe this is the closest we can
 

539
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,269
okay uh maybe this is the closest we can
have it then

540
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
have it then
 

541
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,670
have it then
if we were to go four on this wall it

542
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
if we were to go four on this wall it
 

543
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,110
if we were to go four on this wall it
would take us to

544
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
would take us to
 

545
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,710
would take us to
here

546
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720

 

547
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,710

um

548
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720

 

549
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,470

i still have no idea what i'm doing with

550
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
i still have no idea what i'm doing with
 

551
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,550
i still have no idea what i'm doing with
this if i'm if i'm doing the boat

552
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
this if i'm if i'm doing the boat
 

553
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,509
this if i'm if i'm doing the boat
elevator stuff

554
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
elevator stuff
 

555
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,710
elevator stuff
still or not i'm not sure

556
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720

 

557
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,670

but it would be in the way

558
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
but it would be in the way
 

559
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,150
but it would be in the way
hmm unless i go out further this way

560
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
hmm unless i go out further this way
 

561
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,590
hmm unless i go out further this way
actually this wire is going to be in the

562
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
actually this wire is going to be in the
 

563
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,910
actually this wire is going to be in the
way even if i put it here probably

564
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920

 

565
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,389

huh okay let me think about this

566
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
huh okay let me think about this
 

567
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,230
huh okay let me think about this
and in a mere split second i have

568
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
and in a mere split second i have
 

569
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,949
and in a mere split second i have
figured out what i want to do

570
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
figured out what i want to do
 

571
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,110
figured out what i want to do
so this is where four takes us on this

572
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
so this is where four takes us on this
 

573
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,269
so this is where four takes us on this
side and then

574
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
side and then
 

575
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,350
side and then
one two three fourth one would be here

576
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
one two three fourth one would be here
 

577
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,750
one two three fourth one would be here
and a fifth one would potentially be

578
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
and a fifth one would potentially be
 

579
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,670
and a fifth one would potentially be
here

580
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680

 

581
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,470

so what i'm going to i'm gonna have

582
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
so what i'm going to i'm gonna have
 

583
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,870
so what i'm going to i'm gonna have
three

584
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
three
 

585
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,230
three
on this wall okay

586
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
on this wall okay
 

587
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,470
on this wall okay
and then i'll have five on this wall

588
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
and then i'll have five on this wall
 

589
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,990
and then i'll have five on this wall
we're gonna take this thing out

590
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
we're gonna take this thing out
 

591
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,870
we're gonna take this thing out
it's not doing anything it's it's of no

592
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
it's not doing anything it's it's of no
 

593
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,790
it's not doing anything it's it's of no
value to us right now i hate removing

594
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
value to us right now i hate removing
 

595
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,710
value to us right now i hate removing
something so old in my world

596
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
something so old in my world
 

597
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,389
something so old in my world
but the idea isn't really thought out

598
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
but the idea isn't really thought out
 

599
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,590
but the idea isn't really thought out
so and it's causing problems now so

600
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
so and it's causing problems now so
 

601
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,030
so and it's causing problems now so
let's get rid of it

602
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
let's get rid of it
 

603
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,790
let's get rid of it
and even if i was to do it i would want

604
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
and even if i was to do it i would want
 

605
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,629
and even if i was to do it i would want
it to be built out of iron

606
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
it to be built out of iron
 

607
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,030
it to be built out of iron
bars i'm pretty sure instead of glass

608
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
bars i'm pretty sure instead of glass
 

609
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,069
bars i'm pretty sure instead of glass
panes

610
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
panes
 

611
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,269
panes
or else glass blocks or something else

612
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
or else glass blocks or something else
 

613
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,629
or else glass blocks or something else
anything but glass panes okay

614
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
anything but glass panes okay
 

615
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,550
anything but glass panes okay
so we're gonna do it five furnaces

616
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
so we're gonna do it five furnaces
 

617
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,670
so we're gonna do it five furnaces
these will have to be here we have to i

618
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
these will have to be here we have to i
 

619
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:01,990
these will have to be here we have to i
put

620
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
put
 

621
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,110
put
i put this here to c and it

622
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
i put this here to c and it
 

623
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,629
i put this here to c and it
there's indeed a problem um

624
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
there's indeed a problem um
 

625
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,110
there's indeed a problem um
there's a wire right there and

626
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
there's a wire right there and
 

627
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,949
there's a wire right there and
right there and we would need to put

628
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
right there and we would need to put
 

629
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,790
right there and we would need to put
wire on top here so

630
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
wire on top here so
 

631
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,710
wire on top here so
we should move it out one more block to

632
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
we should move it out one more block to
 

633
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,310
we should move it out one more block to
there

634
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
there
 

635
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,110
there
the furnaces would go here here here

636
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
the furnaces would go here here here
 

637
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,230
the furnaces would go here here here
there and

638
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240

 

639
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,590

one more on top there

640
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
one more on top there
 

641
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,189
one more on top there
and the rest of the space behind is

642
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
and the rest of the space behind is
 

643
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,710
and the rest of the space behind is
going to be for the wiring

644
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720

 

645
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,509

and we will make it all blend together

646
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
and we will make it all blend together
 

647
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,870
and we will make it all blend together
nicely

648
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
nicely
 

649
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,430
nicely
oops

650
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440

 

651
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,470

because i'll probably have to adjust

652
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
because i'll probably have to adjust
 

653
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,870
because i'll probably have to adjust
this water a bit

654
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
furnaces our eight for an eye all ready
 

659
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,150
furnaces our eight for an eye all ready
here with the t-buds hooked up

660
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
here with the t-buds hooked up
 

661

not that
 

713
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,710
not that
now i'll worry about it later uh what

714
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
now i'll worry about it later uh what
 

715
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,669
now i'll worry about it later uh what
we'll do

716
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
we'll do
 

717
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,750
we'll do
let's figure out how the front's gonna

718
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
let's figure out how the front's gonna
 

719
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,950
let's figure out how the front's gonna
look um

720
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
look um
 

721
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,990
look um
should we i'm not gonna do the shutter

722
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
should we i'm not gonna do the shutter
 

723
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,630
should we i'm not gonna do the shutter
thing i don't think

724
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
thing i don't think
 

725
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,150
thing i don't think
just wondering if we should copy that

726
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
just wondering if we should copy that
 

727
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,270
just wondering if we should copy that
look

728
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280

 

729
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,750

um oh yeah you know what i want to do

730
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
um oh yeah you know what i want to do
 

731
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,029
um oh yeah you know what i want to do
actually is make the floor lower so

732
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
actually is make the floor lower so
 

733
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,430
actually is make the floor lower so
like this one it goes down half a block

734
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
like this one it goes down half a block
 

735
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,630
like this one it goes down half a block
let's do the same for this one

736
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
let's do the same for this one
 

737
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,150
let's do the same for this one
let's take that

738
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160

 

739
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,750

maybe let's end this here whoops

740
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760

 

741
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,070

grab these

742
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080

 

743
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,590

okay and then it will

744
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
okay and then it will
 

745
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,590
okay and then it will
switch to stone perhaps

746
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
switch to stone perhaps
 

747
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,789
switch to stone perhaps
and we will work on including

748
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
and we will work on including
 

749
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,870
and we will work on including
other types of blocks once we have our

750
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
other types of blocks once we have our
 

751
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,549
other types of blocks once we have our
shape figured out so we'll just use

752
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
shape figured out so we'll just use
 

753
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,990
shape figured out so we'll just use
stone brick

754
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
stone brick
 

755
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,669
stone brick
for now and see how it looks

756
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679

 

757
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,950

should we maybe we should put stairs to

758
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
should we maybe we should put stairs to
 

759
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,630
should we maybe we should put stairs to
get down

760
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
get down
 

761
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,230
get down
right there and the full block in the

762
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
right there and the full block in the
 

763
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,070
right there and the full block in the
corner and then the floor will be half

764
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
corner and then the floor will be half
 

765
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,150
corner and then the floor will be half
slabs we'll we'll try to make a pattern

766
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
slabs we'll we'll try to make a pattern
 

767
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,190
slabs we'll we'll try to make a pattern
using a different type of block later

768
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
using a different type of block later
 

769
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,950
using a different type of block later
but for now we'll just do solid

770
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960

 

771
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,310

okay and

772
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320

 

773
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,750

and i guess probably put some lighting

774
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
and i guess probably put some lighting
 

775
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,470
and i guess probably put some lighting
in the ceiling

776
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
in the ceiling
 

777
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,990
in the ceiling
also yeah this will look good with the

778
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
also yeah this will look good with the
 

779
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,029
also yeah this will look good with the
furnace is slightly off the ground

780
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
furnace is slightly off the ground
 

781
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,150
furnace is slightly off the ground
but not a full block up i think that's a

782
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
but not a full block up i think that's a
 

783
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,430
but not a full block up i think that's a
good look

784
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440

 

785
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,110

i'll put full blocks here

786
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
i'll put full blocks here
 

787
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:41,510
i'll put full blocks here
maybe don't really know what i'm doing

788
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520

 

789
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,270

um what would look good

790
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280

 

791
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,350

how's this look if we just enclose it

792
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
how's this look if we just enclose it
 

793
00:19:51,360 --> 00:20:01,000
how's this look if we just enclose it
like that

794
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,010

hmm
 

799
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,909
hmm
nope let's try

800
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919

 

801
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,070

put stairs at the top here

802
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
put stairs at the top here
 

803
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,310
put stairs at the top here
that's a little bit better um

804
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
that's a little bit better um
 

805
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:34,230
that's a little bit better um
what about stairs at the bottom

806
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
what about stairs at the bottom
 

807
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,590
what about stairs at the bottom
and

808
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600

 

809
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,270

we'll just hide that i'll have to update

810
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
we'll just hide that i'll have to update
 

811
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,870
we'll just hide that i'll have to update
them again and sync it

812
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
them again and sync it
 

813
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,230
them again and sync it
afterwards yes

814
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
afterwards yes
 

815
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,360

that's not bad how would it look if we
 

823
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:08,549
that's not bad how would it look if we
do this

865
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,070

and with this extra space here would

866
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
and with this extra space here would
 

867
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,350
and with this extra space here would
almost be good to have

868
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
almost be good to have
 

869
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,070
almost be good to have
some sort of entrance into this wire

870
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
some sort of entrance into this wire
 

871

902
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
and to be consistent i would probably
 

903
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,990
and to be consistent i would probably
have to change this one

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
pumpkin one lower and one higher so you
 

1005
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,350
pumpkin one lower and one higher so you
don't see the orange like you do on this

1006

1012
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039

overwhelming the green it's

1018
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
overwhelming the green it's
 

1019
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,070
overwhelming the green it's
it's hidden behind the gray of the fence

1020
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
it's hidden behind the gray of the fence
 

1021
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,590

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,430

i never really decide what i'm doing

1038
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
i never really decide what i'm doing
 

1039
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,110
i never really decide what i'm doing
with the walls in here like if i'm

1040
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
with the walls in here like if i'm
 

1041
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,710
with the walls in here like if i'm
keeping them

1042
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
keeping them
 

1043
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,029
keeping them
the the stone look and just replacing

1044
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
the the stone look and just replacing
 

1045
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,110
the the stone look and just replacing
all the dirt and that with stone or

1046
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
all the dirt and that with stone or
 

1047
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,470
all the dirt and that with stone or
or should i do the whole cave with some

1048
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
or should i do the whole cave with some
 

1049
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,830
or should i do the whole cave with some
other type of block item

1050
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
other type of block item
 

1051
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,430
other type of block item
i'm not sure um

1052
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440

 

1053
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,110

and then like fill in the holes like

1054
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
and then like fill in the holes like
 

1055
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,430
and then like fill in the holes like
that shouldn't be there that hole there

1056
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
that shouldn't be there that hole there
 

1057
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,310
that shouldn't be there that hole there
and maybe smooth stuff out a bit more

1058
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
and maybe smooth stuff out a bit more
 

1059
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,190
and maybe smooth stuff out a bit more
anyway uh yeah so the effects

1060
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
anyway uh yeah so the effects
 

1061
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,710
anyway uh yeah so the effects
you put something in to cook

1062
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
you put something in to cook
 

1063
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,110
you put something in to cook
we'll do another one of these light

1064
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
we'll do another one of these light
 

1065
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,389
we'll do another one of these light
comes on

1066
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
comes on
 

1067
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,310
comes on
which is a bit pointless because

1068
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
which is a bit pointless because
 

1069
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,549
which is a bit pointless because
obviously you get the visual effect from

1070
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
obviously you get the visual effect from
 

1071
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,590
obviously you get the visual effect from
the furnace

1072
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
the furnace
 

1073
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,750
the furnace
you can see the fire through it and the

1074
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
you can see the fire through it and the
 

1075
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,669
you can see the fire through it and the
furnace also emits light so it's not

1076
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
furnace also emits light so it's not
 

1077
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,190
furnace also emits light so it's not
like it's doing a whole lot

1078
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
like it's doing a whole lot
 

1079
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,389
like it's doing a whole lot
but it just helps to emphasize it

1080
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:22,399
but it just helps to emphasize it
 

1081
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,110
but it just helps to emphasize it
and uh it's easy to hook up because we

1082
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
and uh it's easy to hook up because we
 

1083
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,750
and uh it's easy to hook up because we
got

1084
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
got
 

1085
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,430
got
just the way that that particular

1086
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
just the way that that particular
 

1087
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,590
just the way that that particular
tea bud works it's easy to put a piece

1088
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
tea bud works it's easy to put a piece
 

1089
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,870
tea bud works it's easy to put a piece
of clothes or

1090
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
of clothes or
 

1091
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,990
of clothes or
a lamp at the end of it like that but

1092
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
a lamp at the end of it like that but
 

1093
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,310
a lamp at the end of it like that but
the

1094
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
the
 

1095
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,549
the
the main idea is to put note blocks in

1096
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
the main idea is to put note blocks in
 

1097
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,149
the main idea is to put note blocks in
here

1098
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
here
 

1099
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,430
here
we will put those i'm expecting

1100
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
we will put those i'm expecting
 

1101
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,549
we will put those i'm expecting
above like we can easily

1102
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
above like we can easily
 

1103
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,389
above like we can easily
put a wire on top of this and make that

1104
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
put a wire on top of this and make that
 

1105
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,669
put a wire on top of this and make that
go to some notebox above or something

1106
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
go to some notebox above or something
 

1107
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,549
go to some notebox above or something
uh only a few though not many

1108
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559

 

1109
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,470

but the main the main point of this

1110
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
but the main the main point of this
 

1111
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,750
but the main the main point of this
i'll show you

1112
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760

 

1113
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,389

i'm going to run a master wire behind

1114
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
i'm going to run a master wire behind
 

1115
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,590
i'm going to run a master wire behind
here

1116
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
here
 

1117
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,029
here
on all of these

1118
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039

 

1119
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,830

which will connect them all together

1120
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
which will connect them all together
 

1121
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,590
which will connect them all together
i'll not connect them all together it

1122
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
i'll not connect them all together it
 

1123
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,269
i'll not connect them all together it
will

1124
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
will
 

1125
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,190
will
tell me if any of the furnaces are going

1126
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,200
tell me if any of the furnaces are going
 

1127
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,269
tell me if any of the furnaces are going
because if any of those are on this this

1128
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
because if any of those are on this this
 

1129
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,110
because if any of those are on this this
wire is going to be powered by these

1130
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
wire is going to be powered by these
 

1131
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,950
wire is going to be powered by these
torches so

1132
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
torches so
 

1133
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,029
torches so
we will have a main wire

1134
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
we will have a main wire
 

1135
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,230
we will have a main wire
and then we will send that signal to

1136
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
and then we will send that signal to
 

1137
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,190
and then we will send that signal to
other places

1138
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
other places
 

1139
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,669
other places
in the cave so we'll we'll probably send

1140
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
in the cave so we'll we'll probably send
 

1141
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,470
in the cave so we'll we'll probably send
it to this room

1142
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
it to this room
 

1143
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,029
it to this room
first of all we might put some indicator

1144
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
first of all we might put some indicator
 

1145
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,950
first of all we might put some indicator
lights in the floor

1146
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
lights in the floor
 

1147
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,630
lights in the floor
and yeah so when

1148
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
and yeah so when
 

1149
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,190
and yeah so when
say we smelt we have something smelty in

1150
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
say we smelt we have something smelty in
 

1151
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,870
say we smelt we have something smelty in
all eight of these we won't get

1152
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
all eight of these we won't get
 

1153
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,350
all eight of these we won't get
signaled until they're all done with

1154
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
signaled until they're all done with
 

1155
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,549
signaled until they're all done with
this way

1156
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
this way
 

1157
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,669
this way
otherwise we would get signals for each

1158
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
otherwise we would get signals for each
 

1159
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,029
otherwise we would get signals for each
individual one

1160
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039

 

1161
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,990

but yeah like we might have a signal up

1162
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
but yeah like we might have a signal up
 

1163
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,470
but yeah like we might have a signal up
here

1164
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
here
 

1165
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,389
here
some some type of indicator light or i

1166
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
some some type of indicator light or i
 

1167
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,110
some some type of indicator light or i
was thinking of using that zelda soon

1168
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120
was thinking of using that zelda soon
 

1169
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,190
was thinking of using that zelda soon
zelda tune excuse me

1170
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,200

 

1171
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,230

for that and also we could have could

1172
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
for that and also we could have could
 

1173
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,430
for that and also we could have could
run the wire over here

1174
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
run the wire over here
 

1175
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,870
run the wire over here
just a few places around so we can see

1176
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
just a few places around so we can see
 

1177
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,470
just a few places around so we can see
just it's not hard i have lots of space

1178
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
just it's not hard i have lots of space
 

1179
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,630
just it's not hard i have lots of space
underneath this ground like i don't have

1180
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:28,640
underneath this ground like i don't have
 

1181
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,590
underneath this ground like i don't have
much stuff

1182
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
much stuff
 

1183
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,389
much stuff
below here that i have to worry about

1184
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
below here that i have to worry about
 

1185
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,310
below here that i have to worry about
running wire or anything

1186
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
running wire or anything
 

1187
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,830
running wire or anything
plenty of space

1188
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:37,840
plenty of space
 

1189
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,070
plenty of space
aha so that's the furnace room as it is

1190
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
aha so that's the furnace room as it is
 

1191
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,510
aha so that's the furnace room as it is
we will continue this

1192
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
we will continue this
 

1193
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,669
we will continue this
project next time probably

1194
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679

 

1195
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,190

or maybe yeah probably next time

1196
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
or maybe yeah probably next time
 

1197
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,789
or maybe yeah probably next time
of course as always give me your

1198
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
of course as always give me your
 

1199
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,070
of course as always give me your
feedback we're gonna put a door here

1200
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
feedback we're gonna put a door here
 

1201
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,190
feedback we're gonna put a door here
probably an iron door and i think i

1202
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
