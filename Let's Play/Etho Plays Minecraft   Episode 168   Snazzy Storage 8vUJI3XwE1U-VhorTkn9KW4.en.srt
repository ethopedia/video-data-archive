finished
the storage room and i'm quite happy

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
the storage room and i'm quite happy
 

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,550
the storage room and i'm quite happy
with how it turned out so let's go

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
with how it turned out so let's go
 

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,029
with how it turned out so let's go
take a look at it

18
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
take a look at it
 

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,310
take a look at it
there it is and

20
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320

 

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,869

that is the unveiling of the chess when

22
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
that is the unveiling of the chess when
 

23
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,950
that is the unveiling of the chess when
we walk in

24
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
we walk in
 

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,350
we walk in
and the the shutters stay open for as

26
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
and the the shutters stay open for as
 

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,750
and the the shutters stay open for as
long as we're in here and then when we

28
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
long as we're in here and then when we
 

29
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,670
long as we're in here and then when we
walk out we step on the pressure plates

30
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
walk out we step on the pressure plates
 

31
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,950
walk out we step on the pressure plates
again

32
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960

 

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,549

and it closes like that so i think it's

34
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
and it closes like that so i think it's
 

35
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,950
and it closes like that so i think it's
a pretty cool effect

36
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960

 

37
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,150

uh it's gonna need a little bit of

38
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
uh it's gonna need a little bit of
 

39
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,310
uh it's gonna need a little bit of
tweaking yet though

40
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320

 

41
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,070

oh let's oh trying to jump over the

42
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
oh let's oh trying to jump over the
 

43
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,789
oh let's oh trying to jump over the
pressure plates

44
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
pressure plates
 

45
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,789
pressure plates
my sprint didn't work there we go

46
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
my sprint didn't work there we go
 

47
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,230
my sprint didn't work there we go
so yeah i really like how that looks

48
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
so yeah i really like how that looks
 

49
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,590
so yeah i really like how that looks
with the light coming in through the

50
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
with the light coming in through the
 

51
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,830
with the light coming in through the
stairs

52
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
stairs
 

53
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,429
stairs
it's almost like uh a display case

54
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
it's almost like uh a display case
 

55
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,710
it's almost like uh a display case
type look to it and in the very middle

56
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
type look to it and in the very middle
 

57
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,630
type look to it and in the very middle
of the room i've made this

58
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
of the room i've made this
 

59
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,749
of the room i've made this
uh big pot light type thing which i

60
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
uh big pot light type thing which i
 

61
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,270
uh big pot light type thing which i
think looks pretty cool too

62
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280

 

63
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,789

let's get some light in here

64
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799

 

65
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,670

so this is a fairly complicated

66
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
so this is a fairly complicated
 

67
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,389
so this is a fairly complicated
uh that's a stair there that's also a

68
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
uh that's a stair there that's also a
 

69
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,950
uh that's a stair there that's also a
stair

70
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960

 

71
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,109

well not not super complicated and then

72
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
well not not super complicated and then
 

73
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,710
well not not super complicated and then
underneath these half slabs

74
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
underneath these half slabs
 

75
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,230
underneath these half slabs
is pumpkins and that's what

76
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
is pumpkins and that's what
 

77
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,389
is pumpkins and that's what
makes it light like that the light

78
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
makes it light like that the light
 

79
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,230
makes it light like that the light
shines through the half slabs

80
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240

 

81
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,630

and you can see like if it's like that

82
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
and you can see like if it's like that
 

83
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,950
and you can see like if it's like that
that stair and that stair lights up

84
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
that stair and that stair lights up
 

85
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,590
that stair and that stair lights up
but if you have them completely blocked

86
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
but if you have them completely blocked
 

87
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,309
but if you have them completely blocked
off

88
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
off
 

89
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,110
off
you don't have the light leak through

90
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
you don't have the light leak through
 

91
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,190
you don't have the light leak through
and that's kind of a problem i had with

92
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
and that's kind of a problem i had with
 

93
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,390
and that's kind of a problem i had with
this storage room too

94
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
this storage room too
 

95
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,110
this storage room too
i had to change the lighting i was going

96
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
i had to change the lighting i was going
 

97
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,869
i had to change the lighting i was going
to use lamps before

98
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
to use lamps before
 

99
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,470
to use lamps before
and try to do something fancy with them

100
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
and try to do something fancy with them
 

101
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,869
and try to do something fancy with them
but there was an issue with the light

102
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
but there was an issue with the light
 

103
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,830
but there was an issue with the light
leaking through

104
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840

 

105
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,150

um actually we need to change this too

106
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
um actually we need to change this too
 

107
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,430
um actually we need to change this too
well

108
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
well
 

109
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,070
well
i'll show you the problem first

110
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
i'll show you the problem first
 

111
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,910
i'll show you the problem first
um the lamps

112
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
um the lamps
 

113
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,509
um the lamps
were over there before

114
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519

 

115
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,550

where that glowstone is and problem is

116
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
where that glowstone is and problem is
 

117
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,470
where that glowstone is and problem is
the pistons are there

118
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
the pistons are there
 

119
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,509
the pistons are there
as well

120
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
as well
 

121
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,190
as well
hopefully we can see

122
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200

 

123
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,949

and what that does is it makes these

124
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
and what that does is it makes these
 

125
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,869
and what that does is it makes these
stairs light up too

126
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
stairs light up too
 

127
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,550
stairs light up too
and there's really no way of avoiding

128
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
and there's really no way of avoiding
 

129
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,470
and there's really no way of avoiding
that because the pistons

130
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
that because the pistons
 

131
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,750
that because the pistons
are are right there and you can't uh

132
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
are are right there and you can't uh
 

133
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,270
are are right there and you can't uh
can't really move them so all all these

134
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
can't really move them so all all these
 

135
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,390
can't really move them so all all these
had

136
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
had
 

137
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,990
had
light leaking through the bottom stairs

138
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
light leaking through the bottom stairs
 

139
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
light leaking through the bottom stairs
and it didn't look quite as good

140
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
and it didn't look quite as good
 

141
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,470
and it didn't look quite as good
in my opinion so we're just going to use

142
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
in my opinion so we're just going to use
 

143
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,990
in my opinion so we're just going to use
straight glowstone on this whole

144
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
straight glowstone on this whole
 

145
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,990
straight glowstone on this whole
thing so that we don't have that problem

146
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000

 

147
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,309

right i'm very sad i'm all out of

148
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
right i'm very sad i'm all out of
 

149
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,509
right i'm very sad i'm all out of
efficiency picks

150
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
efficiency picks
 

151
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,630
efficiency picks
so i'm gonna have to do some xp

152
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
so i'm gonna have to do some xp
 

153
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,990
so i'm gonna have to do some xp
grinding or something

154
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000

 

155
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,229

um what we're gonna do with these

156
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
um what we're gonna do with these
 

157
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,070
um what we're gonna do with these
probably is get rid of all this light

158
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
probably is get rid of all this light
 

159
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,509
probably is get rid of all this light
wood and just make it

160
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
wood and just make it
 

161
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,470
wood and just make it
a solid glowstone thing back here

162
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
a solid glowstone thing back here
 

163
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,990
a solid glowstone thing back here
has all right otherwise it looks kind of

164
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
has all right otherwise it looks kind of
 

165
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,869
has all right otherwise it looks kind of
weird

166
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879

 

167
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,470

yeah that's probably better that way

168
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480

 

169
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,789

okay i just switched them all they'll

170
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
okay i just switched them all they'll
 

171
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,949
okay i just switched them all they'll
have glowstone there now

172
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
have glowstone there now
 

173
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,149
have glowstone there now
uh with this lighting it's not

174
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
uh with this lighting it's not
 

175
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,550
uh with this lighting it's not
actual lighting it's a visual just

176
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
actual lighting it's a visual just
 

177
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,589
actual lighting it's a visual just
visual lighting

178
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
visual lighting
 

179
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,909
visual lighting
but like as far as the game consists

180
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
but like as far as the game consists
 

181
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,509
but like as far as the game consists
considers it

182
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
considers it
 

183
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,870
considers it
if you look at the block lighting right

184
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
if you look at the block lighting right
 

185
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,430
if you look at the block lighting right
where i'm standing it's at level zero so

186
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
where i'm standing it's at level zero so
 

187
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,670
where i'm standing it's at level zero so
it's pitch black right here

188
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
it's pitch black right here
 

189
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,510
it's pitch black right here
and again with that that's not lighting

190
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
and again with that that's not lighting
 

191
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,150
and again with that that's not lighting
anything it just uh

192
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
anything it just uh
 

193
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,590
anything it just uh
just a visual thing the only thing

194
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
just a visual thing the only thing
 

195
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,590
just a visual thing the only thing
really lighting this room is uh

196
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
really lighting this room is uh
 

197
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,790
really lighting this room is uh
the pumpkins under there

198
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
the pumpkins under there
 

199
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,310
the pumpkins under there
and under there and if we walk

200
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
and under there and if we walk
 

201
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,110
and under there and if we walk
towards it we can see this is a block

202
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
towards it we can see this is a block
 

203
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,070
towards it we can see this is a block
lighting right here

204
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
lighting right here
 

205
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,390
lighting right here
the bl right here we're at one

206
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
the bl right here we're at one
 

207
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,550
the bl right here we're at one
two three four five and as we approach

208
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
two three four five and as we approach
 

209
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,150
two three four five and as we approach
the light it gets

210
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
the light it gets
 

211
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,350
the light it gets
gets higher um

212
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360

 

213
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,270

there was some concern about mobs

214
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
there was some concern about mobs
 

215
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,189
there was some concern about mobs
spawning in here because if it's

216
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
spawning in here because if it's
 

217
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,350
spawning in here because if it's
pitch black it's possible mobs could

218
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
pitch black it's possible mobs could
 

219
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,150
pitch black it's possible mobs could
have spawned on the corners

220
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
have spawned on the corners
 

221
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,629
have spawned on the corners
not to worry i have switched those out

222
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
not to worry i have switched those out
 

223
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,710
not to worry i have switched those out
these are actually upside down half

224
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
these are actually upside down half
 

225
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,870
these are actually upside down half
slabs now so

226
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
slabs now so
 

227
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,990
slabs now so
no mobs can spawn in here anymore

228
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
no mobs can spawn in here anymore
 

229
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,590
no mobs can spawn in here anymore
can't spawn on stairs and they can't

230
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
can't spawn on stairs and they can't
 

231
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,430
can't spawn on stairs and they can't
spawn on half slab so it's completely

232
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
spawn on half slab so it's completely
 

233
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,790
spawn on half slab so it's completely
safe

234
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
safe
 

235
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,629
safe
and out here it's bright enough that

236
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
and out here it's bright enough that
 

237
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,749
and out here it's bright enough that
it's not a problem

238
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759

 

239
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,550

and let's go take a look at the wiring

240
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
and let's go take a look at the wiring
 

241
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,230
and let's go take a look at the wiring
shall we real quick

242
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
shall we real quick
 

243
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,270
shall we real quick
there's two layers of wiring this is the

244
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
there's two layers of wiring this is the
 

245
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,150
there's two layers of wiring this is the
bottom pistons over here

246
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
bottom pistons over here
 

247
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,510
bottom pistons over here
and i'm going to clean up this room when

248
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
and i'm going to clean up this room when
 

249
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,390
and i'm going to clean up this room when
this is all done make the walls all

250
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
this is all done make the walls all
 

251
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,310
this is all done make the walls all
all smooth stone and what not

252
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320

 

253
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,590

pressure plates is right two pressure

254
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
pressure plates is right two pressure
 

255
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,830
pressure plates is right two pressure
plates are above here and here

256
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
plates are above here and here
 

257
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,590
plates are above here and here
they power this wire and it sends power

258
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
they power this wire and it sends power
 

259
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,469
they power this wire and it sends power
to

260
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
to
 

261
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,390
to
this t flip flop here which is kind of

262
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
this t flip flop here which is kind of
 

263
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
this t flip flop here which is kind of
hidden away

264
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
hidden away
 

265
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,870
hidden away
um it's powered by default

266
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
um it's powered by default
 

267
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,110
um it's powered by default
i believe so it's a supercharged one

268
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
i believe so it's a supercharged one
 

269
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,029
i believe so it's a supercharged one
which makes it a little quicker

270
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
which makes it a little quicker
 

271
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,070
which makes it a little quicker
and that goes up to torch here

272
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
and that goes up to torch here
 

273
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,350
and that goes up to torch here
and up over here so the first pistons

274
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
and up over here so the first pistons
 

275
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,350
and up over here so the first pistons
that activate are the ones in the middle

276
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
that activate are the ones in the middle
 

277
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,309
that activate are the ones in the middle
those are set at four then there's a

278
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
those are set at four then there's a
 

279
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,590
those are set at four then there's a
four delay between

280
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
four delay between
 

281
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,230
four delay between
each chest section and then it goes to

282
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
each chest section and then it goes to
 

283
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,550
each chest section and then it goes to
four

284
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560

 

285
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,070

four two four four two four four two

286
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
four two four four two four four two
 

287
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,469
four two four four two four four two
four so it's pretty simple pattern

288
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
four so it's pretty simple pattern
 

289
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,749
four so it's pretty simple pattern
other side is the same and the top layer

290
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
other side is the same and the top layer
 

291
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,430
other side is the same and the top layer
is the same as well this wire

292
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
is the same as well this wire
 

293
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,710
is the same as well this wire
in the middle keeps going up and

294
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
in the middle keeps going up and
 

295
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,990
in the middle keeps going up and
connects to

296
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
connects to
 

297
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,189
connects to
middle of the top pistons and

298
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
middle of the top pistons and
 

299
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,510
middle of the top pistons and
again four four two four four two four

300
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
again four four two four four two four
 

301
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,510
again four four two four four two four
four two four all the way down

302
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520

 

303
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,950

and that's all there is to it so it's

304
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
and that's all there is to it so it's
 

305
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,870
and that's all there is to it so it's
pretty simple i was going to do

306
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
pretty simple i was going to do
 

307
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,309
pretty simple i was going to do
something with the lamps

308
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
something with the lamps
 

309
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,029
something with the lamps
but i think it's just better this way

310
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
but i think it's just better this way
 

311
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,589
but i think it's just better this way
and it's

312
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
and it's
 

313
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,710
and it's
a lot less laggy now that i got rid of

314
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
a lot less laggy now that i got rid of
 

315
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,029
a lot less laggy now that i got rid of
what i had wired for them you can see i

316
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
what i had wired for them you can see i
 

317
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,309
what i had wired for them you can see i
have like uh

318
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
have like uh
 

319
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,029
have like uh
like i had something here before i did

320
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
like i had something here before i did
 

321
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,350
like i had something here before i did
but i tore it all out

322
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
but i tore it all out
 

323
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,790
but i tore it all out
probably should have recorded it before

324
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
probably should have recorded it before
 

325
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,029
probably should have recorded it before
i did but oh well

326
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
i did but oh well
 

327
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,629
i did but oh well
wasn't overly cool uh there is an

328
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
wasn't overly cool uh there is an
 

329
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,070
wasn't overly cool uh there is an
issue with this though and i don't

330
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
issue with this though and i don't
 

331
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,150
issue with this though and i don't
really know what's causing it

332
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
really know what's causing it
 

333
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,390
really know what's causing it
it closes perfect exactly like it should

334
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
it closes perfect exactly like it should
 

335
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,430
it closes perfect exactly like it should
each of the pistons is uh two delay

336
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
each of the pistons is uh two delay
 

337
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,589
each of the pistons is uh two delay
apart from each other

338
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
apart from each other
 

339
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,909
apart from each other
but when it opens you can see some of

340
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
but when it opens you can see some of
 

341
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,790
but when it opens you can see some of
the stairs

342
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
the stairs
 

343
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,749
the stairs
on the top row are not

344
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
on the top row are not
 

345
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,350
on the top row are not
opening together like this this stair

346
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
opening together like this this stair
 

347

here comes up before this one

348
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
here comes up before this one
 

349
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,430
here comes up before this one
this watch

350
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440

 

351
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,869

even though they have the exact same

352
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
even though they have the exact same
 

353
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,710
even though they have the exact same
delay

354
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
delay
 

355
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,469
delay
uh there's a problem and that happens

356
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
uh there's a problem and that happens
 

357
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,790
uh there's a problem and that happens
for all of these i don't know

358
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
for all of these i don't know
 

359
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,990
for all of these i don't know
why exactly they close perfectly

360
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
why exactly they close perfectly
 

361
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,230
why exactly they close perfectly
in unison they just don't open right

362
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
in unison they just don't open right
 

363
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,230
in unison they just don't open right
so you saw that one came up first then

364
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
so you saw that one came up first then
 

365
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,350
so you saw that one came up first then
that one

366
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
that one
 

367
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,390
that one
that one came up first then that one

368
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
that one came up first then that one
 

369
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,629
that one came up first then that one
which is weird because this one is

370
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
which is weird because this one is
 

371
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,830
which is weird because this one is
supposed to have

372
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
supposed to have
 

373
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,110
supposed to have
a delay that's too shorter than that one

374
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
a delay that's too shorter than that one
 

375
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,550
a delay that's too shorter than that one
so i don't know could be just a visual

goes
four then this is a two and that's at

396
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
four then this is a two and that's at
 

397
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,670
four then this is a two and that's at
four so there's no

398
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
four so there's no
 

399
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,790
four so there's no

there's six types of these and i don't

634
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
there's six types of these and i don't
 

635
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,230
there's six types of these and i don't
know how many types of these i can only

636
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
know how many types of these i can only
 

637
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,430
know how many types of these i can only
think of the five

638
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
think of the five
 

639
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,509
think of the five
um this is my rail stuff so

640
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
um this is my rail stuff so
 

641
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,350
um this is my rail stuff so
tracks detector rails power rails

642
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
tracks detector rails power rails
 

643
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,189
tracks detector rails power rails
carts all go in here

644
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199

 

645
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,269

now i just call this my function chest

646
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
now i just call this my function chest
 

647
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,590
now i just call this my function chest
so this is blocks that have

648
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
so this is blocks that have
 

649
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,670
so this is blocks that have
uh unique functions sort of

650
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680

 

651
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,750

and lights and pistons and what not

652
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
and lights and pistons and what not
 

653
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,310
and lights and pistons and what not
going here

654
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
going here
 

655
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,710
going here
redstone chest and

656
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
redstone chest and
 

657
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,910
redstone chest and
you should maybe be moved i don't know

658
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
you should maybe be moved i don't know
 

659
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,030
you should maybe be moved i don't know
and this is my oars chest

660
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
and this is my oars chest
 

661
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,550
and this is my oars chest
and that's all there is to it so i think

662
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
and that's all there is to it so i think
 

663
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,230
and that's all there is to it so i think
i can pretty much

664
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
i can pretty much
 

665
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,629
i can pretty much
categorize all the items in the game

666
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
categorize all the items in the game
 

667
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,590
categorize all the items in the game
into

668

into
 

669
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,030
into
into those fairly easily uh

670
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
into those fairly easily uh
 

671
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,030
into those fairly easily uh
things like coal and blaze rods will

672
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
things like coal and blaze rods will
 

673
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,550
things like coal and blaze rods will
probably go into the furnace room when

674
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
probably go into the furnace room when
 

675
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,949
probably go into the furnace room when
it

676
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
it
 

677
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,990
it
when i get that set up um

678
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
when i get that set up um
 

679
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,269
when i get that set up um
but that's the storage room maybe

680
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
but that's the storage room maybe
 

681
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,670
but that's the storage room maybe
quickly play around with using some

682
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
quickly play around with using some
 

683
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,670
quickly play around with using some
sandstone slabs on the floor and roof

684
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
sandstone slabs on the floor and roof
 

685
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,949
sandstone slabs on the floor and roof
and see how that goes

686
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959

 

687
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,550

so most that stuff came from these

688
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
so most that stuff came from these
 

689
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,990
so most that stuff came from these
chests down here and they're

690
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
chests down here and they're
 

691
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,030
chests down here and they're
pretty much empty now uh there's a few

692
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
pretty much empty now uh there's a few
 

693
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,990
pretty much empty now uh there's a few
things left

694
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
things left
 

695
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,910
things left
if you're prone to seizures you probably

696
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
if you're prone to seizures you probably
 

697
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,550
if you're prone to seizures you probably
should close your eyes for a minute here

698
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
should close your eyes for a minute here
 

699
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,030
should close your eyes for a minute here
just gonna go through them real quick

700
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
just gonna go through them real quick
 

701
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,150

mostly just bulk items left in here
 

703
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,590
mostly just bulk items left in here
and these will get moved to the main

704
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
and these will get moved to the main
 

705
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,069
and these will get moved to the main
storage room which we will build

706
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
storage room which we will build
 

707
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,189
storage room which we will build
uh hopefully sometime soon keep saying

708
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
uh hopefully sometime soon keep saying
 

709
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,430
uh hopefully sometime soon keep saying
i'm going to do it but then

710
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
i'm going to do it but then
 

711
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,350
i'm going to do it but then
other things are coming up

712
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360

 

713
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,269

so i do really like the way i have this

714
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
so i do really like the way i have this
 

715

room shaped

716
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
room shaped
 

717
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,310
room shaped
i don't really want to change that at

718
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
i don't really want to change that at
 

719
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,069
i don't really want to change that at
all but

720
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
all but
 

721
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,150
all but
like this floor here is just one big

722
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
like this floor here is just one big
 

723
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,150
like this floor here is just one big
solid thing of uh

724
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
solid thing of uh
 

725
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,990
solid thing of uh
wooden slabs it would be cool to break

726
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
wooden slabs it would be cool to break
 

727
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,590
wooden slabs it would be cool to break
that up somewhat

728
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
that up somewhat
 

729
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,269
that up somewhat
with uh maybe these other textures

730
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
with uh maybe these other textures
 

731
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,269
with uh maybe these other textures
so i wanted to see how they all look

732
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
so i wanted to see how they all look
 

733
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,269
so i wanted to see how they all look
together with the wood

734
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
together with the wood
 

735
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,910
together with the wood
and pick the one that suits it the most

736
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920

 

737
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,629

so we'll just put these all down pick

738
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
so we'll just put these all down pick
 

739
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,269
so we'll just put these all down pick
our favorites

740
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279

 

741
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,790

yeah so out of these i think the brick

742
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
yeah so out of these i think the brick
 

743
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,590
yeah so out of these i think the brick
doesn't go at all um

744
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
doesn't go at all um
 

745
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,230
doesn't go at all um
these these two don't really look right

746
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
these these two don't really look right
 

747
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,230
these these two don't really look right
to me either

748
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
to me either
 

749
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,949
to me either
sandstone looks the best in my opinion

750
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
sandstone looks the best in my opinion
 

751
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,829
sandstone looks the best in my opinion
and this would be

752
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
and this would be
 

753
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,629
and this would be
second so let maybe let's try something

754
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
second so let maybe let's try something
 

755
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,910
second so let maybe let's try something
with sandstone

756
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920

 

757
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,069

um one thing that was suggested is i

758
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
um one thing that was suggested is i
 

759
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,430
um one thing that was suggested is i
should make a chest

760
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
should make a chest
 

761
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,910
should make a chest
pixel art i don't know how that will

762
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
pixel art i don't know how that will
 

763
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,230
pixel art i don't know how that will
turn out but i guess we could try it and

764
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
turn out but i guess we could try it and
 

765
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,270
turn out but i guess we could try it and
just

766
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
just
 

767
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,750
just
just see so i think i had a look at

768
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
just see so i think i had a look at
 

769
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,789
just see so i think i had a look at
the way the chest looks right here

770
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
the way the chest looks right here
 

771
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,230
the way the chest looks right here
and it would be we got about an eight by

772
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
and it would be we got about an eight by
 

773
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,789
and it would be we got about an eight by
eight space to work here

774
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799

 

775
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,870

maybe we'll just highlight it out of uh

776
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880

 

777
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,110

we'll put this here for now highlight it

778
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
we'll put this here for now highlight it
 

779
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,870
we'll put this here for now highlight it
out of sandstone and see

780
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
out of sandstone and see
 

781
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,230
out of sandstone and see
how it looks

782
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240

 

783
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310

and if it looks crummy we will try

784
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
and if it looks crummy we will try
 

785
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,830
and if it looks crummy we will try
something else

786
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840

 

787
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,669

832
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520

 

833
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,029

836
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960

 

837
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,430

839
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,750

all right well i'll just do some pattern

840
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
all right well i'll just do some pattern
 

841
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,190
all right well i'll just do some pattern
i guess i want to see what this looks

842
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
i guess i want to see what this looks
 

843
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,990
i guess i want to see what this looks
like too

844
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
like too
 

845
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,630
like too
if we were to replace this with the

846
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
if we were to replace this with the
 

847
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,590
if we were to replace this with the
sandstone instead of the wood

848
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600

 

849
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,950

that's kind of cool i like that

850
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
that's kind of cool i like that
 

851
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,710
that's kind of cool i like that
i can't do a whole lot with this because

852
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
i can't do a whole lot with this because
 

853
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,390
i can't do a whole lot with this because
we need to pick a block that has

854
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
we need to pick a block that has
 

855
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,669
we need to pick a block that has
both the slabs and stairs and there's

856
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
both the slabs and stairs and there's
 

857
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,070
both the slabs and stairs and there's
really not a whole lot of options

858
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
really not a whole lot of options
 

859
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,830
really not a whole lot of options
there is these which don't go with wood

860
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
there is these which don't go with wood
 

861
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,190
there is these which don't go with wood
in my opinion same with these

862
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200

 

863
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,510

nether brick might go but we don't have

864
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
nether brick might go but we don't have
 

865
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,430
nether brick might go but we don't have
half slabs in them

866
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
half slabs in them
 

867
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,549
half slabs in them
and i don't like brick with it so that

868
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
and i don't like brick with it so that
 

869
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,430
and i don't like brick with it so that
leaves zero

870
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
leaves zero
 

871
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,789
leaves zero
options really so

872
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
options really so
 

873
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,549
options really so
this room will probably mostly just be

874
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
this room will probably mostly just be
 

875
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,230
this room will probably mostly just be
wooden planks because i can't think of

876
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
wooden planks because i can't think of
 

877
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,430
wooden planks because i can't think of
any other

878
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
any other
 

879
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,350
any other
way of doing it that would look good

880
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360

 

881
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,110

okay tell me which pattern you like the

882
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
okay tell me which pattern you like the
 

883
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,270
okay tell me which pattern you like the
most we'll call this

884
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
most we'll call this
 

885
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,830
most we'll call this
pattern one or option one it's kind of

886
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
pattern one or option one it's kind of
 

887
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,710
pattern one or option one it's kind of
like a target

888
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
like a target
 

889
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,750
like a target
i guess not too bad

890
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
i guess not too bad
 

891
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,909
i guess not too bad
i'm going to try another one now and see

892
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
i'm going to try another one now and see
 

893
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,149
i'm going to try another one now and see
if you like it more

894
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
if you like it more
 

895
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,789
if you like it more
this is it in the dark

896
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799

 

897
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,789

and we'll call this one pattern number

898
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
and we'll call this one pattern number
 

899
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,750
and we'll call this one pattern number
two

900
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760

 

901
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,390

with the dark

902
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400

 

903
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,230

and we'll call this one pattern number

904
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
and we'll call this one pattern number
 

905
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,510
and we'll call this one pattern number
three

906
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
three
 

907
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,630
three
and with an option of also having a

908
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
and with an option of also having a
 

909
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,470

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480

 

911
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,789

not sure which one i prefer the most i'm

912
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
not sure which one i prefer the most i'm
 

913
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,630
not sure which one i prefer the most i'm
sort of leaning towards number one

914
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
sort of leaning towards number one
 

915
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,470
sort of leaning towards number one
even though number two is sort of a

916
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
even though number two is sort of a
 

917
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,830
even though number two is sort of a
favorite of mine it doesn't

918
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
favorite of mine it doesn't
 

919
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,870
favorite of mine it doesn't
look quite right to me with the sharp

920
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
look quite right to me with the sharp
 

921
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,549
look quite right to me with the sharp
angle

922
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559

 

923
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,909

but let me know which one you guys

924
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919
but let me know which one you guys

other things i wanted to do today
 

931
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,230
other things i wanted to do today
but it's going to be a shorter episode

932
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
but it's going to be a shorter episode
 

933
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,669
but it's going to be a shorter episode
after all because

934
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
after all because
 

935
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,669
after all because
it is 2 a.m and i need to get some sleep

936
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
it is 2 a.m and i need to get some sleep
 

937
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,430
it is 2 a.m and i need to get some sleep
unfortunately but before we end this

938
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
unfortunately but before we end this
 

939
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,149
unfortunately but before we end this
i just wanted to show you my new cool

940
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
i just wanted to show you my new cool
 

941
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,110
i just wanted to show you my new cool
trick

942
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
trick
 

943
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,029
trick
for crossing bodies of water in the game

944
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
for crossing bodies of water in the game
 

945
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,510
for crossing bodies of water in the game
uh if for some reason you don't have

946
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
uh if for some reason you don't have
 

947
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,430
uh if for some reason you don't have
like an ender pearl or a boat or

948
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
like an ender pearl or a boat or
 

949
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,149
like an ender pearl or a boat or
something and you need to cross

950
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
something and you need to cross
 

951
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,310
something and you need to cross
water quickly maybe if someone's chasing

952
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
water quickly maybe if someone's chasing
 

953
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,110
water quickly maybe if someone's chasing
you or whatnot

954
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
you or whatnot
 

955
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,190
you or whatnot
i know it's impractical but it's a lot

956
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
i know it's impractical but it's a lot
 

957
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,230
i know it's impractical but it's a lot
of fun to do this

958
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
of fun to do this
 

959
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,549
of fun to do this
uh i've been trying to teach myself this

960
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
uh i've been trying to teach myself this
 

961
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,590
uh i've been trying to teach myself this
uh

962
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600
uh
 

963
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,710
uh
this new move i'm calling the lily pad

964
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
this new move i'm calling the lily pad
 

965
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,350
this new move i'm calling the lily pad
hop

966
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360

 

967
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,750

uh you kind of angle your mouse down

968
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
uh you kind of angle your mouse down
 

969
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,870
uh you kind of angle your mouse down
like this

970
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
like this
 

971
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,110
like this
run and failure

972
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
run and failure
 

973
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,950
run and failure
it's very tough to do actually let's try

974
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
it's very tough to do actually let's try
 

975
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,789
it's very tough to do actually let's try
it one more time

976
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
it one more time
 

977
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,630
it one more time
or until we get it

978
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640

 

979
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,789

all right let's try it one more time

980
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799

 

981
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,630

oh man i think i might have had my mouse

982
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
oh man i think i might have had my mouse
 

983
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,669
oh man i think i might have had my mouse
angled a little bit too far forward

984
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679

 

985
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,990

i'll try like this

986
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000

 

987
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,149

oh see that time i clicked the mouse too

988
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
oh see that time i clicked the mouse too
 

989
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,149
oh see that time i clicked the mouse too
quick it you got to get into a pattern

990
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
quick it you got to get into a pattern
 

991
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,909
quick it you got to get into a pattern
of doing it it's

992
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
of doing it it's
 

993
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,830
of doing it it's
it gets easier the more you do it i'm

994
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
it gets easier the more you do it i'm
 

995
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,430
it gets easier the more you do it i'm
just a little bit out of practice

996
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
just a little bit out of practice
 

997
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,789
just a little bit out of practice
at the moment there we go there we go

998
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
at the moment there we go there we go
 

999
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,830
at the moment there we go there we go
here we go we're doing it we're doing it

1000
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
here we go we're doing it we're doing it
 

1001
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,789
here we go we're doing it we're doing it
lily pad hop ah almost made it across

1002
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
lily pad hop ah almost made it across
 

1003
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,710
lily pad hop ah almost made it across
but i thought that was pretty cool

1004
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720

 

1005
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,909

anyway that's it thank you for watching

1006
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
anyway that's it thank you for watching
 

1007
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,070
anyway that's it thank you for watching
until next time probably in two days

1008
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
until next time probably in two days
 

1009
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,830
until next time probably in two days
again that's what i've been trying to do

1010
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840

 

1011
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,830
