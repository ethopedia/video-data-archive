back guys how's it going I am in the
middle of some speed mining here I'm

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:17,220
middle of some speed mining here I'm
 

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,960
middle of some speed mining here I'm
trying to collect redstone oh speaking

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:20,970
trying to collect redstone oh speaking
 

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,900
trying to collect redstone oh speaking
of which ah yeah oh oh we're good we're

I'm all out of torches so I have to
 

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,970
I'm all out of torches so I have to
probably stop here but yeah I've been

probably stop here but yeah I've been
 

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,530
probably stop here but yeah I've been
collecting lots of stuff down here

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:33,540
collecting lots of stuff down here
 

19
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,709
collecting lots of stuff down here
trying to get more materials ready for

20
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
trying to get more materials ready for
 

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,510
trying to get more materials ready for
the Nexus project a lot of you guys seem

22
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
the Nexus project a lot of you guys seem
 

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,700
the Nexus project a lot of you guys seem
excited about that so want to try make

24
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:40,710
excited about that so want to try make
 

25
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,240
excited about that so want to try make
some headway on it today again there was

26
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,250
some headway on it today again there was
 

27
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,880
some headway on it today again there was
a spawner down here actually kind of

28
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:46,890
a spawner down here actually kind of
 

29
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,000
a spawner down here actually kind of
surprised me got a saddle from it but

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,010
surprised me got a saddle from it but
 

31
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,880
surprised me got a saddle from it but
this area was generated a long long time

32
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:52,890
this area was generated a long long time
 

33
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,590
this area was generated a long long time
ago so there's no chance I can get

34
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
ago so there's no chance I can get
 

35
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,319
ago so there's no chance I can get
nametags or horse armor or anything like

36
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:57,329
nametags or horse armor or anything like
 

37
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,700
nametags or horse armor or anything like
that because it was before that time

38
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:00,710
that because it was before that time
 

39
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,820
that because it was before that time
before it was possible anyway so we got

40
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830
before it was possible anyway so we got
 

41
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,830
before it was possible anyway so we got
we got a bit of stuff collected here

42
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:06,840
we got a bit of stuff collected here
 

43
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,050
we got a bit of stuff collected here
though maybe three stacks of redstone

44
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,060
though maybe three stacks of redstone
 

45
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,960
though maybe three stacks of redstone
blocks maybe a little bit more also need

46
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:14,970
blocks maybe a little bit more also need
 

47
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,749
blocks maybe a little bit more also need
lots of iron we need over 750 hoppers

48
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
lots of iron we need over 750 hoppers
 

49
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,469
lots of iron we need over 750 hoppers
for the project so that's like oh I

50
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:21,479
for the project so that's like oh I
 

51
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,380
for the project so that's like oh I
don't know that's over what is that

52
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,390
don't know that's over what is that
 

53
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,320
don't know that's over what is that
through don't do math on camera either

54
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,330
through don't do math on camera either
 

55
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,980
through don't do math on camera either
big mistake there

56
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,990
big mistake there
 

57
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,910
big mistake there
3,750 did I do that right let's hope I

58
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
3,750 did I do that right let's hope I
 

59
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,139
3,750 did I do that right let's hope I
did

did
if I can't do it with my fingers I

62
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:38,429
if I can't do it with my fingers I
 

63
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,520
if I can't do it with my fingers I
shouldn't do math when I record because

64
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,530
shouldn't do math when I record because
 

65
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,330
shouldn't do math when I record because
I can't concentrate enough to do it ah

66
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,340
I can't concentrate enough to do it ah
 

67
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,029
I can't concentrate enough to do it ah
yeah look at it look at it it's so

Tawes 14 stacks redstone or not counting
what we got today as well

78
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:03,619
what we got today as well
 

79
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,020
what we got today as well
but this is what we got from previous

80
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,030
but this is what we got from previous
 

81
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,289
but this is what we got from previous
speed mining adventures and I am going

82
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:09,299
speed mining adventures and I am going
 

83
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:14,600
speed mining adventures and I am going
to fortunate and that might be half the

84
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,610
to fortunate and that might be half the
 

85
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,390
to fortunate and that might be half the
redstone we need I don't know we'll see

86
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
redstone we need I don't know we'll see
 

87
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,460
redstone we need I don't know we'll see
how far it goes the big thing that's

88
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,470
how far it goes the big thing that's
 

89
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,140
how far it goes the big thing that's
gonna hold us up though is the iron

90
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,150
gonna hold us up though is the iron
 

91
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,680
gonna hold us up though is the iron
shortage but will will make some

92
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,690
shortage but will will make some
 

93
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,600
shortage but will will make some
progress today the main thing I want to

94
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:26,610
progress today the main thing I want to
 

95
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,789
progress today the main thing I want to
do is just try to get one side done so

96
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:28,799
do is just try to get one side done so
 

97
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:29,960
do is just try to get one side done so
that we can see how it's going to work

98
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,970
that we can see how it's going to work
 

99
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,970
that we can see how it's going to work
and then as I get the materials we'll

100
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:31,980
and then as I get the materials we'll
 

101
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,949
and then as I get the materials we'll
build the rest of them I'll build them

102
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:33,959
build the rest of them I'll build them
 

103
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,350
build the rest of them I'll build them
off camera or something we'll work it

104
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
off camera or something we'll work it
 

105
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,000
off camera or something we'll work it
out it'll get done um but this would

106
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,010
out it'll get done um but this would
 

107
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,050
out it'll get done um but this would
take a while

108
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
take a while
 

109
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,809
take a while
just how many chests I will fill with

110
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:44,819
just how many chests I will fill with
 

111
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,309
just how many chests I will fill with
this or how many stacks there will be

112
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
this or how many stacks there will be
 

113
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,490
this or how many stacks there will be
total I'll show you after it's done

114
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:51,500
total I'll show you after it's done
 

115
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,800
total I'll show you after it's done
Booya check it out this chest is full

116
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:54,810
Booya check it out this chest is full
 

117
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,190
Booya check it out this chest is full
and then we have all this so it works

118
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
and then we have all this so it works
 

119
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,910
and then we have all this so it works
out to eighty three stacks plus 46 and

120
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
out to eighty three stacks plus 46 and
 

121
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,690
out to eighty three stacks plus 46 and
another one almost eighty four 5358 dust

122
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,700
another one almost eighty four 5358 dust
 

123
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,720
another one almost eighty four 5358 dust
aha I gotta go get some packed ice

124
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:11,730
aha I gotta go get some packed ice
 

125
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,849
aha I gotta go get some packed ice
though too for this project so that's

126
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:13,859
though too for this project so that's
 

127
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,050
though too for this project so that's
what I'm gonna do next

128
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,060

 

129
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,569

all right so here we are um originally I

130
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:23,579
all right so here we are um originally I
 

131
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,699
all right so here we are um originally I
was just like I was harvesting normal

132
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:25,709
was just like I was harvesting normal
 

133
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,650
was just like I was harvesting normal
ice and I was going to use that instead

134
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:27,660
ice and I was going to use that instead
 

135
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,390
ice and I was going to use that instead
but all the ice is for the water streams

136
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
but all the ice is for the water streams
 

137
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
but all the ice is for the water streams
for carrying items and it's going to be

138
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,410
for carrying items and it's going to be
 

139
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,009
for carrying items and it's going to be
right next to all the redstone so if it

140
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,019
right next to all the redstone so if it
 

141
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,710
right next to all the redstone so if it
melts its gonna wash away all the

142
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
melts its gonna wash away all the
 

143
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,009
melts its gonna wash away all the
redstone so I want packed ice because it

144
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:46,019
redstone so I want packed ice because it
 

145
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,830
redstone so I want packed ice because it
can't melt

146
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
can't melt
 

147
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,059
can't melt
this is a safety thing because I know

148
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:50,069
this is a safety thing because I know
 

149
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,119
this is a safety thing because I know
I'm going to do that major headache if

150
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:53,129
I'm going to do that major headache if
 

151
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,970
I'm going to do that major headache if
it happens oh yeah this stuff what when

152
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
it happens oh yeah this stuff what when
 

153
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,800
it happens oh yeah this stuff what when
I first came out oops

154
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:00,810
I first came out oops
 

155
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,610
I first came out oops
when I go to my languages volume when

156
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
when I go to my languages volume when
 

157
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,320
when I go to my languages volume when
the Pat dice first came out you could

158
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,330
the Pat dice first came out you could
 

159
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,089
the Pat dice first came out you could
not mine it instantly like this but they

160
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:08,099
not mine it instantly like this but they
 

161
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,369
not mine it instantly like this but they
changed it this is just efficiency for

162
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:10,379
changed it this is just efficiency for
 

163
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,879
changed it this is just efficiency for
oh it's so much fun oh yeah I remember I

164
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:16,889
oh it's so much fun oh yeah I remember I
 

165
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,789
oh it's so much fun oh yeah I remember I
came here and I spent like 20 minutes

166
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:19,799
came here and I spent like 20 minutes
 

167
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,550
came here and I spent like 20 minutes
mining out one of these and it's like

168
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
mining out one of these and it's like
 

169
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,200
mining out one of these and it's like
nope I'm done I'm out of here okay

170
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,210
nope I'm done I'm out of here okay
 

171
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,090
nope I'm done I'm out of here okay
everybody so we got some stuff together

172
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,100
everybody so we got some stuff together
 

173
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,129
everybody so we got some stuff together
here we can get working on this I want

174
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:31,139
here we can get working on this I want
 

175
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,689
here we can get working on this I want
to show you today how we're going to do

176
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:32,699
to show you today how we're going to do
 

177
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,200
to show you today how we're going to do
the rest of this storage room or the

178
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,210
the rest of this storage room or the
 

179
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,140
the rest of this storage room or the
rest of these storage units I guess

180
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,150
rest of these storage units I guess
 

181
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,490
rest of these storage units I guess
there's really not a lot left to it

182
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
there's really not a lot left to it
 

183
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
there's really not a lot left to it
actually we did the redstone last time

184
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:42,810
actually we did the redstone last time
 

185
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,110
actually we did the redstone last time
and I explained how this bit systems

186
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
and I explained how this bit systems
 

187
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,210
and I explained how this bit systems
gonna work mostly you guys seem to get

188
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:47,220
gonna work mostly you guys seem to get
 

189
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,330
gonna work mostly you guys seem to get
it which is great afterwards I was like

190
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,340
it which is great afterwards I was like
 

191
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,629
it which is great afterwards I was like
did I explain that well I'm not sure I'm

192
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
did I explain that well I'm not sure I'm
 

193
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,930
did I explain that well I'm not sure I'm
kind of bad at that but majority of you

194
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
kind of bad at that but majority of you
 

195
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,670
kind of bad at that but majority of you
seem to to get what I was trying to

196
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
seem to to get what I was trying to
 

197
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,370
seem to to get what I was trying to
explain anyway so that's good I did make

198
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,380
explain anyway so that's good I did make
 

199
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,320
explain anyway so that's good I did make
a mistake though last time I had like a

200
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,330
a mistake though last time I had like a
 

201
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,710
a mistake though last time I had like a
line of redstone below like where I just

202
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
line of redstone below like where I just
 

203
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,950
line of redstone below like where I just
broke those blocks and somebody pointed

204
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:09,960
broke those blocks and somebody pointed
 

205
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,529
broke those blocks and somebody pointed
out that if these repeaters turn on and

206
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:12,539
out that if these repeaters turn on and
 

207
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,600
out that if these repeaters turn on and
they power these blocks they're going to

208
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,610
they power these blocks they're going to
 

209
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,520
they power these blocks they're going to
power the Redstone below so they were

210
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,530
power the Redstone below so they were
 

211
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,980
power the Redstone below so they were
not separate so I move that off to the

212
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:18,990
not separate so I move that off to the
 

213
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,560
not separate so I move that off to the
side here now they are separate I've

214
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:21,570
side here now they are separate I've
 

215
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,260
side here now they are separate I've
also wired up this second line of

216
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
also wired up this second line of
 

217
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,870
also wired up this second line of
pistons here the second bit to the

218
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
pistons here the second bit to the
 

219
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,770
pistons here the second bit to the
system and it seems to work good so when

220
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:30,780
system and it seems to work good so when
 

221
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,240
system and it seems to work good so when
I pull this they all extend or retract

222
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,250
I pull this they all extend or retract
 

223
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,589
I pull this they all extend or retract
and they switch between either this

224
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:36,599
and they switch between either this
 

225
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,510
and they switch between either this
dispenser in this one or this one in

226
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,520
dispenser in this one or this one in
 

227
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,050
dispenser in this one or this one in
this one um that's what this this line

228
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,060
this one um that's what this this line
 

229
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,189
this one um that's what this this line
of pistons does that was a little tricky

230
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
of pistons does that was a little tricky
 

231
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,529
of pistons does that was a little tricky
to keep separate so I got like a line of

232
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:48,539
to keep separate so I got like a line of
 

233
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,050
to keep separate so I got like a line of
redstone here goes to this block but it

234
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
redstone here goes to this block but it
 

235
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,750
redstone here goes to this block but it
does not connect to this wire instead it

236
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:53,760
does not connect to this wire instead it
 

237
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,219
does not connect to this wire instead it
goes through and then it's like yeah

238
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:58,229
goes through and then it's like yeah
 

239
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,930
goes through and then it's like yeah
it's a little messy

240
00:05:59,930 --> 00:05:59,940
it's a little messy
 

241
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,840
it's a little messy
but it's good and then it powers it here

242
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:02,850
but it's good and then it powers it here
 

243
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,870
but it's good and then it powers it here
and then this is wire oh and I just

244
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:05,880
and then this is wire oh and I just
 

245
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,930
and then this is wire oh and I just
cracked everything now I think I had

246
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:08,940
cracked everything now I think I had
 

247
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,280
cracked everything now I think I had
wire here anyway so let's get to it

248
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,290
wire here anyway so let's get to it
 

249
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,100
wire here anyway so let's get to it
let's build I guess we'll start at that

250
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,110
let's build I guess we'll start at that
 

251
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,780
let's build I guess we'll start at that
end maybe I'll skip the night because I

252
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:17,790
end maybe I'll skip the night because I
 

253
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,140
end maybe I'll skip the night because I
think it's just about dark so here we go

254
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,150
think it's just about dark so here we go
 

255
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,200
think it's just about dark so here we go
let's get to to the building that might

256
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,210
let's get to to the building that might
 

257
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,450
let's get to to the building that might
make a few mistakes just be patient with

258
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:26,460
make a few mistakes just be patient with
 

259
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,700
make a few mistakes just be patient with
me but we're going to have that on top

260
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,710
me but we're going to have that on top
 

261
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,490
me but we're going to have that on top
right I had pretty much everybody

262
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,500
right I had pretty much everybody
 

263
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,020
right I had pretty much everybody
convinced I was going to be using

264
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,030
convinced I was going to be using
 

265
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,630
convinced I was going to be using
hoppers for the main item transportation

266
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:35,640
hoppers for the main item transportation
 

267
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,110
hoppers for the main item transportation
like have hoppers going sideways to

268
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
like have hoppers going sideways to
 

269
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,060
like have hoppers going sideways to
these droppers you can do this you know

270
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,070
these droppers you can do this you know
 

271
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,060
these droppers you can do this you know
it'll these droppers will put the items

272
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,070
it'll these droppers will put the items
 

273
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,320
it'll these droppers will put the items
right into the hopper and then they'll

274
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,330
right into the hopper and then they'll
 

275
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,880
right into the hopper and then they'll
carry it but no we're not doing that

276
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:48,890
carry it but no we're not doing that
 

277
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,280
carry it but no we're not doing that
because hoppers are expensive and they

278
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,290
because hoppers are expensive and they
 

279
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,440
because hoppers are expensive and they
also cause a little bit of lag each one

280
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450
also cause a little bit of lag each one
 

281
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,070
also cause a little bit of lag each one
so I would rather use ice streams for

282
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
so I would rather use ice streams for
 

283
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,710
so I would rather use ice streams for
moving items around and people were

284
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
moving items around and people were
 

285
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,910
moving items around and people were
wondering how I was going to do that

286
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:01,920
wondering how I was going to do that
 

287
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,490
wondering how I was going to do that
because really the ice streams need to

288
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
because really the ice streams need to
 

289
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,830
because really the ice streams need to
go here because items are getting shot

290
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
go here because items are getting shot
 

291
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,860
go here because items are getting shot
out but we are struggling with space a

292
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:09,870
out but we are struggling with space a
 

293
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,040
out but we are struggling with space a
little bit with this design we have to

294
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,050
little bit with this design we have to
 

295
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,710
little bit with this design we have to
compact things as much as possible and

296
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
compact things as much as possible and
 

297
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,670
compact things as much as possible and
we have to do a trick because of that we

298
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
we have to do a trick because of that we
 

299
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,520
we have to do a trick because of that we
have to put the blocks right by the

300
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,530
have to put the blocks right by the
 

301
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,130
have to put the blocks right by the
hopper or the that's not a hopper

302
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,140
hopper or the that's not a hopper
 

303
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,380
hopper or the that's not a hopper
dropper yeah

304
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,390
dropper yeah
 

305
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,460
dropper yeah
and items have this tendency to go

306
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,470
and items have this tendency to go
 

307
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,380
and items have this tendency to go
upwards when they're inside a block so

308
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,390
upwards when they're inside a block so
 

309
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,300
upwards when they're inside a block so
they're going to go up into the item

310
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,310
they're going to go up into the item
 

311
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,030
they're going to go up into the item
stream through the block but we have to

312
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,040
stream through the block but we have to
 

313
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,930
stream through the block but we have to
make sure it's solid around it otherwise

314
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940
make sure it's solid around it otherwise
 

315
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,970
make sure it's solid around it otherwise
they'll just fall out somewhere so we're

316
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:43,980
they'll just fall out somewhere so we're
 

317
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,190
they'll just fall out somewhere so we're
going to build it up like this and tell

318
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,200
going to build it up like this and tell
 

319
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,300
going to build it up like this and tell
you what I'm just going to run down a

320
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,310
you what I'm just going to run down a
 

321
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,170
you what I'm just going to run down a
little ways with this so that we can get

322
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,180
little ways with this so that we can get
 

323
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,620
little ways with this so that we can get
a little more distance with it I guess

324
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,630
a little more distance with it I guess
 

325
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,820
a little more distance with it I guess
alright so I haven't figured out exactly

326
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:55,830
alright so I haven't figured out exactly
 

327
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,590
alright so I haven't figured out exactly
what this is going to look like when

328
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:57,600
what this is going to look like when
 

329
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,500
what this is going to look like when
it's done like the actual storage room

330
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,510
it's done like the actual storage room
 

331
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,120
it's done like the actual storage room
but I figure we'll have a column here of

332
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,130
but I figure we'll have a column here of
 

333
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,100
but I figure we'll have a column here of
some sorts so I'm just going to build

334
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,110
some sorts so I'm just going to build
 

335
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,900
some sorts so I'm just going to build
that and this is what we're going to

336
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:05,910
that and this is what we're going to
 

337
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,270
that and this is what we're going to
attach our signs to for holding the

338
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,280
attach our signs to for holding the
 

339
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,760
attach our signs to for holding the
water in place so at each of these we'll

340
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:10,770
water in place so at each of these we'll
 

341
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,690
water in place so at each of these we'll
just put a sign

342
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:11,700
just put a sign
 

343
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,960
just put a sign
and they'll have to be a block of some

344
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:14,970
and they'll have to be a block of some
 

345
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,610
and they'll have to be a block of some
sort over here so I'll just put glass

346
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:16,620
sort over here so I'll just put glass
 

347
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,970
sort over here so I'll just put glass
for now all right

348
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:19,980
for now all right
 

349
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,220
for now all right
and I brought some normal ice we will

350
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,230
and I brought some normal ice we will
 

351
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,960
and I brought some normal ice we will
use a little bit of this just to get

352
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:23,970
use a little bit of this just to get
 

353
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,470
use a little bit of this just to get
water tada

354
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:26,480
water tada
 

355
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,460
water tada
and another one here all right so let's

356
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,470
and another one here all right so let's
 

357
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,310
and another one here all right so let's
try this out of course we use I I sin

358
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
try this out of course we use I I sin
 

359
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,409
try this out of course we use I I sin
our water streams because it moves items

360
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:36,419
our water streams because it moves items
 

361
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,310
our water streams because it moves items
really really quick and in order for

362
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
really really quick and in order for
 

363
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
really really quick and in order for
this storage room to be really effective

364
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,530
this storage room to be really effective
 

365
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,780
this storage room to be really effective
we want to get our items as quick as

366
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:44,790
we want to get our items as quick as
 

367
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,640
we want to get our items as quick as
possible otherwise like we won't we

368
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:46,650
possible otherwise like we won't we
 

369
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,410
possible otherwise like we won't we
don't want to order our items and then

370
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,420
don't want to order our items and then
 

371
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,750
don't want to order our items and then
be waiting a minute for them to arrive

372
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
be waiting a minute for them to arrive
 

373
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,810
be waiting a minute for them to arrive
we want them as soon as possible

374
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:52,820
we want them as soon as possible
 

375
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,600
we want them as soon as possible
and it looks like it'll take maybe and

376
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:58,610
and it looks like it'll take maybe and
 

377
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,970
and it looks like it'll take maybe and
seconds 15 seconds to travel from here

378
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:01,980
seconds 15 seconds to travel from here
 

379
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,910
seconds 15 seconds to travel from here
the farthest distance to us possibly um

380
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:06,920
the farthest distance to us possibly um
 

381
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,670
the farthest distance to us possibly um
just judging from this test here so

382
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:10,680
just judging from this test here so
 

383
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,470
just judging from this test here so
let's try this out maybe we'll put some

384
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
let's try this out maybe we'll put some
 

385
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,630
let's try this out maybe we'll put some
items in here this is something I made

386
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
items in here this is something I made
 

387
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,940
items in here this is something I made
sure to test quite a bit because I was

388
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:16,950
sure to test quite a bit because I was
 

389
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,290
sure to test quite a bit because I was
worried it wasn't going to work

390
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,300
worried it wasn't going to work
 

391
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,000
worried it wasn't going to work
tell you what I'll just put a dropper

392
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,010
tell you what I'll just put a dropper
 

393
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,450
tell you what I'll just put a dropper
bra I'll leave her here you see the

394
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:23,460
bra I'll leave her here you see the
 

395
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,480
bra I'll leave her here you see the
items popping up there that thing going

396
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,490
items popping up there that thing going
 

397
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,820
items popping up there that thing going
here did it no sometimes it's hard to

398
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:28,830
here did it no sometimes it's hard to
 

399
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,800
here did it no sometimes it's hard to
tell what they do they they don't drop

400
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:30,810
tell what they do they they don't drop
 

401
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,440
tell what they do they they don't drop
drop in the proper place all the time

402
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,450

 

403
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,020

but yeah it seems like it's 100%

404
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,030
but yeah it seems like it's 100%
 

405
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,280
but yeah it seems like it's 100%
effective no items on the ground out

406
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,290
effective no items on the ground out
 

407
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,670
effective no items on the ground out
here note we're good

408
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
here note we're good
 

409
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,840
here note we're good
ah-huh so we are gonna have some extra

410
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:50,850
ah-huh so we are gonna have some extra
 

411
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,000
ah-huh so we are gonna have some extra
storage above these hoppers as well

412
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,010
storage above these hoppers as well
 

413
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,020
storage above these hoppers as well
let's get these in and this is what we

414
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,030
let's get these in and this is what we
 

415
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,160
let's get these in and this is what we
connect our item filters to which we

416
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,170
connect our item filters to which we
 

417
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,960
connect our item filters to which we
will set up in just a second just give

418
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:02,970
will set up in just a second just give
 

419
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,830
will set up in just a second just give
me a second

420
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:03,840
me a second
 

421
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,730
me a second
I'm almost done okay and just like right

422
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:07,740
I'm almost done okay and just like right
 

423
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,530
I'm almost done okay and just like right
into the chest like this that went into

424
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,540
into the chest like this that went into
 

425
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,140
into the chest like this that went into
the chest right you know any little

426
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,150
the chest right you know any little
 

427
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,360
the chest right you know any little
mistake I make with this is gonna be a

428
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,370
mistake I make with this is gonna be a
 

429
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,720
mistake I make with this is gonna be a
nightmare to define probably when I'm

430
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:20,730
nightmare to define probably when I'm
 

431
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,150
nightmare to define probably when I'm
all done I'll be like what did I do

432
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,160
all done I'll be like what did I do
 

433
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,100
all done I'll be like what did I do
wrong it and then I'll find out oh one

434
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,110
wrong it and then I'll find out oh one
 

435
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,280
wrong it and then I'll find out oh one
of

436
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,290
of
 

437
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,050
of
offers is facing the wrong direction or

438
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,060
offers is facing the wrong direction or
 

439
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:35,420
offers is facing the wrong direction or
something stupid um yay I'm blanking a

440
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,430
something stupid um yay I'm blanking a
 

441
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,980
something stupid um yay I'm blanking a
little bit right now I think I had

442
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:36,990
little bit right now I think I had
 

443
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,350
little bit right now I think I had
blocks next to these like that yeah I

444
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
blocks next to these like that yeah I
 

445
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,949
blocks next to these like that yeah I
must have and then we use comparators

446
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:45,959
must have and then we use comparators
 

447
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,759
must have and then we use comparators
and then we do the other hoppers going

448
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:49,769
and then we do the other hoppers going
 

449
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:58,370
and then we do the other hoppers going
into those and then then I think I had

450
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:58,380
into those and then then I think I had
 

451
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,720
into those and then then I think I had
those going into a block and this is

452
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,730
those going into a block and this is
 

453
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,850
those going into a block and this is
your classic item filter I guess I don't

454
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:04,860
your classic item filter I guess I don't
 

455
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,530
your classic item filter I guess I don't
have nearly enough space hollowed out

456
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,540
have nearly enough space hollowed out
 

457
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,319
have nearly enough space hollowed out
here oops

458
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:09,329
here oops
 

459
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:14,680
here oops
I thought I did hey let's get some light

460
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,690
I thought I did hey let's get some light
 

461
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,990
I thought I did hey let's get some light
get the light in here alright so I think

462
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
get the light in here alright so I think
 

463
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,790
get the light in here alright so I think
then we go down one and then another

464
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
then we go down one and then another
 

465
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,139
then we go down one and then another
step down this is your classic filter

466
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:27,149
step down this is your classic filter
 

467
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,420
step down this is your classic filter
I'm sure you're familiar with it if you

468
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,430
I'm sure you're familiar with it if you
 

469
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm sure you're familiar with it if you
do redstone stuff like this um although

470
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,130
do redstone stuff like this um although
 

471
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,460
do redstone stuff like this um although
it might be easier if we do put the

472
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,470
it might be easier if we do put the
 

473
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,569
it might be easier if we do put the
repeater in first I will optimize how to

474
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:41,579
repeater in first I will optimize how to
 

475
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,150
repeater in first I will optimize how to
build this later I'm sure after doing it

476
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
build this later I'm sure after doing it
 

477
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,059
build this later I'm sure after doing it
a few dozen times I'm sure I'll figure

478
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:47,069
a few dozen times I'm sure I'll figure
 

479
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,100
a few dozen times I'm sure I'll figure
it out the best way they're supposed to

480
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,110
it out the best way they're supposed to
 

481
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,920
it out the best way they're supposed to
be repeaters here though I know and then

482
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:51,930
be repeaters here though I know and then
 

483
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,910
be repeaters here though I know and then
let's put our blocks back and redstone

484
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
let's put our blocks back and redstone
 

485
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,900
let's put our blocks back and redstone
dust all over here so when the the

486
00:11:59,900 --> 00:11:59,910
dust all over here so when the the
 

487
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,610
dust all over here so when the the
signal travels two blocks it powers the

488
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,620
signal travels two blocks it powers the
 

489
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,809
signal travels two blocks it powers the
repeaters and then those go two blocks

490
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:08,819
repeaters and then those go two blocks
 

491
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,030
repeaters and then those go two blocks
here and then torches and I was worried

492
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
here and then torches and I was worried
 

493
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,290
here and then torches and I was worried
no I did make a mistake darn it see a

494
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,300
no I did make a mistake darn it see a
 

495
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,120
no I did make a mistake darn it see a
lot of stuff I haven't figured out

496
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,130
lot of stuff I haven't figured out
 

497
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,579
lot of stuff I haven't figured out
totally but what's gonna happen here is

498
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:22,589
totally but what's gonna happen here is
 

499
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,699
totally but what's gonna happen here is
it's gonna power the piston below darn

500
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:25,709
it's gonna power the piston below darn
 

501
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,480
it's gonna power the piston below darn
it so I gotta move all that

502
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,490
it so I gotta move all that
 

503
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,910
it so I gotta move all that
I was so careful it's hard to be

504
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
I was so careful it's hard to be
 

505
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,430
I was so careful it's hard to be
compacting with your space because like

506
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,440
compacting with your space because like
 

507
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,639
compacting with your space because like
torches can power a lot of stuff you

508
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:39,649
torches can power a lot of stuff you
 

509
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,120
torches can power a lot of stuff you
don't want it to and I just found out I

510
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,130
don't want it to and I just found out I
 

511
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,550
don't want it to and I just found out I
have to change it a little bit yet but

512
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
have to change it a little bit yet but
 

513
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,930
have to change it a little bit yet but
then there was supposed to be packed ice

514
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:46,940
then there was supposed to be packed ice
 

515
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,360
then there was supposed to be packed ice
above here I'm not sure can I open the

516
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,370
above here I'm not sure can I open the
 

517
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,610
above here I'm not sure can I open the
chest oh I can't darn it another flaw

518
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:56,620
chest oh I can't darn it another flaw
 

519
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,910
chest oh I can't darn it another flaw
that is using regular ice before that's

520
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
that is using regular ice before that's
 

521
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,440
that is using regular ice before that's
what happens when you change things last

522
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,450
what happens when you change things last
 

523
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:08,650
what happens when you change things last
minute now what do i do do i teep teep

524
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:08,660
minute now what do i do do i teep teep
 

525
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,900
minute now what do i do do i teep teep
at normal ice and just be really careful

526
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:10,910
at normal ice and just be really careful
 

527
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,300
at normal ice and just be really careful
with the torches or what I'm not sure

528
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,310
with the torches or what I'm not sure
 

529
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,699
with the torches or what I'm not sure
now I think that's what I'll probably

530
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:15,709
now I think that's what I'll probably
 

531
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,120
now I think that's what I'll probably
have to do uh-huh

532
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,130
have to do uh-huh
 

533
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,280
have to do uh-huh
anyway looks like there's a few changes

534
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,290
anyway looks like there's a few changes
 

535
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,590
anyway looks like there's a few changes
that need to be made but anyway that's

536
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:26,600
that need to be made but anyway that's
 

537
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,449
that need to be made but anyway that's
the general gist of the whole thing I

538
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:28,459
the general gist of the whole thing I
 

539
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:29,949
the general gist of the whole thing I
basically just have to repeat this

540
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:29,959
basically just have to repeat this
 

541
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,790
basically just have to repeat this
pattern all the way down and like 15

542
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:33,800
pattern all the way down and like 15
 

543
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,030
pattern all the way down and like 15
more times that's going to be the bulk

544
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
more times that's going to be the bulk
 

545
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,250
more times that's going to be the bulk
of the work and where the majority of

546
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,260
of the work and where the majority of
 

547
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,410
of the work and where the majority of
the resources go but what we did we have

548
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:44,420
the resources go but what we did we have
 

549
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,170
the resources go but what we did we have
the lower item stream here this is to

550
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,180
the lower item stream here this is to
 

551
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,940
the lower item stream here this is to
retrieve items out of the storage room

552
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:48,950
retrieve items out of the storage room
 

553
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,550
retrieve items out of the storage room
to get them to us then we have this

554
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:51,560
to get them to us then we have this
 

555
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,800
to get them to us then we have this
other ice stream this is to put items

556
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:53,810
other ice stream this is to put items
 

557
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,470
other ice stream this is to put items
into the storage room to automatically

558
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
into the storage room to automatically
 

559
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,740
into the storage room to automatically
sort them and to do that we use this

560
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,750
sort them and to do that we use this
 

561
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,440
sort them and to do that we use this
filter thing this allows us to choose

562
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,450
filter thing this allows us to choose
 

563
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,500
filter thing this allows us to choose
what items go into what chests so for

564
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,510
what items go into what chests so for
 

565
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:12,400
what items go into what chests so for
example if I did this the signal is

566
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,410
example if I did this the signal is
 

567
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,290
example if I did this the signal is
going to go over two blocks for a little

568
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,300
going to go over two blocks for a little
 

569
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,810
going to go over two blocks for a little
bit there and now it's only one block

570
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:16,820
bit there and now it's only one block
 

571
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,019
bit there and now it's only one block
and this is all the items that get stuck

572
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:20,029
and this is all the items that get stuck
 

573
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,769
and this is all the items that get stuck
in there so if an item tries to go over

574
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:23,779
in there so if an item tries to go over
 

575
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,769
in there so if an item tries to go over
top this hopper that doesn't belong just

576
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:26,779
top this hopper that doesn't belong just
 

577
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,720
top this hopper that doesn't belong just
bounces off and keeps going down the

578
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,730
bounces off and keeps going down the
 

579
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,680
bounces off and keeps going down the
stream but if you throw stone in it'll

580
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:32,690
stream but if you throw stone in it'll
 

581
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,090
stream but if you throw stone in it'll
accept that

582
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,100

 

583
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,610

aha and that goes into the dropper below

584
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:39,620
aha and that goes into the dropper below
 

585
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,360
aha and that goes into the dropper below
into storage I'm going to be using the

586
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,370
into storage I'm going to be using the
 

587
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,240
into storage I'm going to be using the
trick the zip crowd used they aligned

588
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,250
trick the zip crowd used they aligned
 

589
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,760
trick the zip crowd used they aligned
items against an enderchest and I think

590
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:48,770
items against an enderchest and I think
 

591
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,610
items against an enderchest and I think
that allows it to pass both on the ice

592
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:51,620
that allows it to pass both on the ice
 

593
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,800
that allows it to pass both on the ice
here and on the hopper so it gets the

594
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:53,810
here and on the hopper so it gets the
 

595
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,380
here and on the hopper so it gets the
speed boost from the ice I can still get

596
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,390
speed boost from the ice I can still get
 

597
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,200
speed boost from the ice I can still get
picked up from the hopper I believe is

598
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,210
picked up from the hopper I believe is
 

599
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,160
picked up from the hopper I believe is
the way that works and one other thing

600
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,170
the way that works and one other thing
 

601
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,280
the way that works and one other thing
this these trapped chests here actually

602
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,290
this these trapped chests here actually
 

603
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,520
this these trapped chests here actually
activates the droppers below so if I

604
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:09,530
activates the droppers below so if I
 

605
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,960
activates the droppers below so if I
want to come into the storage room and

606
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:10,970
want to come into the storage room and
 

607
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,230
want to come into the storage room and
get items out manually I have to take it

608
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
get items out manually I have to take it
 

609
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,930
get items out manually I have to take it
from the dropper not from these these

610
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:16,940
from the dropper not from these these
 

611
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,790
from the dropper not from these these
all the items from these chests will

612
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
all the items from these chests will
 

613
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,150
all the items from these chests will
flow down though into here otherwise

614
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
flow down though into here otherwise
 

615
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,150
flow down though into here otherwise
they'll get shot into the item stream

616
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
they'll get shot into the item stream
 

617
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,130
they'll get shot into the item stream
but anyway that that's about it let's go

618
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,140
but anyway that that's about it let's go
 

619
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,260
but anyway that that's about it let's go
do something else and I'll work on this

620
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,270
do something else and I'll work on this
 

621
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,810
do something else and I'll work on this
more later and fix the interference we

622
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:31,820
more later and fix the interference we
 

623
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,380
more later and fix the interference we
have and yeah now there's something I've

624
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,390
have and yeah now there's something I've
 

625
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,060
have and yeah now there's something I've
been meaning to bring up with you guys

626
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,070
been meaning to bring up with you guys
 

627
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,590
been meaning to bring up with you guys
for a little while here I want your

628
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:38,600
for a little while here I want your
 

629
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,390
for a little while here I want your
feedback on it um but this nether hub we

630
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,400
feedback on it um but this nether hub we
 

631
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,820
feedback on it um but this nether hub we
have here I know it you know it's it's

632
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:47,830
