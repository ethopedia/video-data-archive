archway up one more block like so and I

336
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:20,770
archway up one more block like so and I
 

337
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,060
archway up one more block like so and I
keep like switching let's put the wood

338
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,070
keep like switching let's put the wood
 

339
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,860
keep like switching let's put the wood
over there that way I don't keep doing

340
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:25,870
over there that way I don't keep doing
 

341
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,620
over there that way I don't keep doing
that okay like that and then can we move

342
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:31,630
that okay like that and then can we move
 

343
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,019
that okay like that and then can we move
this little little thing here forward

344
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:34,029
this little little thing here forward
 

345
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,790
this little little thing here forward
one block maybe that'll do the trick

346
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
one block maybe that'll do the trick
 

347
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
one block maybe that'll do the trick
guys listen to this you listening you

for I've gotten into the habit of
 

359
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,910
for I've gotten into the habit of
sitting up straight because if I ever

360
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
sitting up straight because if I ever
 

361
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
sitting up straight because if I ever
leaned back while recording it would

362
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:58,930
leaned back while recording it would
 

363
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,500
leaned back while recording it would
make this giant squeak sound and I would

364
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,510
make this giant squeak sound and I would
 

365
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,260
make this giant squeak sound and I would
like to have to scrap the footage so I

366
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,270
like to have to scrap the footage so I
 

367
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,090
like to have to scrap the footage so I

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,100
just got into the habit of never moving
 

369
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,980
just got into the habit of never moving
while recording and it wasn't very

370
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:07,990
while recording and it wasn't very
 

371
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,470
while recording and it wasn't very
comfortable now I didn't like lean back

372
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
comfortable now I didn't like lean back
 

373
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,250

get rid of this and something we'll
 

379
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,220
get rid of this and something we'll
worry about that later I did this thing

380
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,230
worry about that later I did this thing
 

381
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,290
worry about that later I did this thing
here I think my original plan was to put

382
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,300
here I think my original plan was to put
 

383
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,630
here I think my original plan was to put
water in this lake channel so let's try

384
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,640
water in this lake channel so let's try
 

385
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,950
water in this lake channel so let's try
that outs and just see what it looks

386
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:34,960
that outs and just see what it looks
 

387
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,010
that outs and just see what it looks
like see if we wanted to do that let's

388
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,020
like see if we wanted to do that let's
 

389
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,900
like see if we wanted to do that let's
make sure it doesn't make a mess of the

390
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:39,910
make sure it doesn't make a mess of the
 

391
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,460
make sure it doesn't make a mess of the
man cave those who will block off some

392
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,470
man cave those who will block off some
 

393
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,450
man cave those who will block off some
of the paths here and I brought some ice

394
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,460
of the paths here and I brought some ice
 

395
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,810
of the paths here and I brought some ice
to do it okay so if we just put water

396
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:48,820
to do it okay so if we just put water
 

397
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,770
to do it okay so if we just put water
here

398
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:49,780
here
 

399
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,010
here
let it flow what does that look like can

400
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,020
let it flow what does that look like can
 

401
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,000
let it flow what does that look like can
we do it both sides and try beat it it's

402
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,010
we do it both sides and try beat it it's
 

403
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,470
we do it both sides and try beat it it's
gonna try flow somewhere here I'm gonna

404
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
gonna try flow somewhere here I'm gonna
 

405
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,900
gonna try flow somewhere here I'm gonna
stop it oh oh it didn't make it all the

406
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:03,910
stop it oh oh it didn't make it all the
 

407
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,850
stop it oh oh it didn't make it all the
way down

408
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:04,860
way down
 

409
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,650
way down
alright let's bust this good how does

410
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:10,660
alright let's bust this good how does
 

411
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,830
alright let's bust this good how does
that feel it might be okay another thing

412
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:16,840
that feel it might be okay another thing
 

413
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,300
that feel it might be okay another thing
I'm gonna do here I'm just gonna go long

414
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,310
I'm gonna do here I'm just gonna go long
 

415
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,310
I'm gonna do here I'm just gonna go long
and span the walls here with leaves and

416
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
and span the walls here with leaves and
 

417
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
and span the walls here with leaves and
see if I like that or not and then we'll

418
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,450
see if I like that or not and then we'll
 

419
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,330
see if I like that or not and then we'll
start making little refinements to the

420
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:24,340
start making little refinements to the
 

421
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,950
start making little refinements to the
whole thing here okay well it's starting

422
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:28,960
whole thing here okay well it's starting
 

423
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,470
whole thing here okay well it's starting
to do something here right starting to

424
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,480
to do something here right starting to
 

425
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,470
to do something here right starting to
take some sort of shape it's okay for

426
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
take some sort of shape it's okay for
 

427
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
take some sort of shape it's okay for
for first rough draft so we got the

428
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:38,650
for first rough draft so we got the
 

429
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,850
for first rough draft so we got the
water kind of evened out now and I've

430
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:41,860
water kind of evened out now and I've
 

431
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,160
water kind of evened out now and I've
added in these like dark oak pillars as

432
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,170
added in these like dark oak pillars as
 

433
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,860
added in these like dark oak pillars as
like a supports type of thing and then I

434
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:46,870
like a supports type of thing and then I
 

435
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,380
like a supports type of thing and then I
did this slab thing running across I'm

436
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,390
did this slab thing running across I'm
 

437
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,900
did this slab thing running across I'm
trying to make it similar to other parts

438
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:51,910
trying to make it similar to other parts
 

439
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,240
trying to make it similar to other parts
of the man tube like borrowing similar

440
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,250
of the man tube like borrowing similar
 

441
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,610
of the man tube like borrowing similar
things I've done but also trying to make

442
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:56,620
things I've done but also trying to make
 

443
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,220
things I've done but also trying to make
it a unique section of the man cave like

444
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,230
it a unique section of the man cave like
 

445
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,650
it a unique section of the man cave like
you that I did the water over here for

446
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:01,660
you that I did the water over here for
 

447
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,650
you that I did the water over here for
example so it kind of copies that having

448
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:04,660
example so it kind of copies that having
 

449
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,500
example so it kind of copies that having
the water on both sides

450
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,510
the water on both sides
 

451
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,120
the water on both sides
and you know arches leaves all that kind

452
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,130
and you know arches leaves all that kind
 

453
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,790
and you know arches leaves all that kind
of stuffs pretty common throughout the

454
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:13,800
of stuffs pretty common throughout the
 

455
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,460
of stuffs pretty common throughout the
cave here but it's it's a little bit

456
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,470
cave here but it's it's a little bit
 

457
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,319
cave here but it's it's a little bit
different right like nowhere in the cave

458
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:18,329
different right like nowhere in the cave
 

459
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,379
different right like nowhere in the cave
do we have leaves on the side like this

460
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:20,389
do we have leaves on the side like this
 

461
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,930
do we have leaves on the side like this
right now it still looks pretty rough

462
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:22,940
right now it still looks pretty rough
 

463
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,180
right now it still looks pretty rough
pretty bad but we might be able to

464
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,190
pretty bad but we might be able to
 

465
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,629
pretty bad but we might be able to
refine it might make like a path going

466
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:29,639
refine it might make like a path going
 

467
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,600
refine it might make like a path going
this way just so it's not totally even

468
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,610
this way just so it's not totally even
 

469
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,170
this way just so it's not totally even
on both sides too and I guess we want

470
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,180
on both sides too and I guess we want
 

471
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,610
on both sides too and I guess we want
some some sort of entrance something

472
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:43,620
some some sort of entrance something
 

473
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,290
some some sort of entrance something
that makes it feel like you're going in

474
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
that makes it feel like you're going in
 

475
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,930
that makes it feel like you're going in
into something right right now it's not

476
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:47,940
into something right right now it's not
 

477
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,629
into something right right now it's not
quite giving that feel the way I want it

478
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
quite giving that feel the way I want it
 

479
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,540
quite giving that feel the way I want it
so I'm gonna build up pillars here I

480
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,550
so I'm gonna build up pillars here I
 

481
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,310
so I'm gonna build up pillars here I
think just to give some height on our

482
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,320
think just to give some height on our
 

483
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,310
think just to give some height on our
sides see if that makes it better

484
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
sides see if that makes it better
 

485
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,280

being enclosed as we go in yeah and then
 

489
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,920
being enclosed as we go in yeah and then
have like maybe leaves I don't know

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:12,930
have like maybe leaves I don't know
 

491
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,199
have like maybe leaves I don't know
leaves might do do something here too I

492
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:17,209
leaves might do do something here too I
 

493
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,840
leaves might do do something here too I
feel like we need to maybe I'll just

494
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:20,850
feel like we need to maybe I'll just
 

495
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,809
feel like we need to maybe I'll just
mark the area jumping around all over

496
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:23,819
mark the area jumping around all over
 

497
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:26,199
mark the area jumping around all over
the place like an idiot here all right

498
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:26,209
the place like an idiot here all right
 

499
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:35,319
the place like an idiot here all right
maybe if we bring it out like this and

500
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:35,329

 

501
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,350

sort of start rounding it and then maybe

502
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
sort of start rounding it and then maybe
 

503
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,879
sort of start rounding it and then maybe
one more like that that's kind of the

504
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:42,889
one more like that that's kind of the
 

505
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,980
one more like that that's kind of the
amount of space I want open as we go

506
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:45,990
amount of space I want open as we go
 

507
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,620
amount of space I want open as we go
down here right so then I want to build

508
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:48,630
down here right so then I want to build
 

509
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,189
down here right so then I want to build
that up so it's sort of straight over

510
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:52,199
that up so it's sort of straight over
 

511
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,490
that up so it's sort of straight over
here kind of like a quarter circle I

512
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,500
here kind of like a quarter circle I
 

513
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,710
here kind of like a quarter circle I
guess you would call it quarter steer oh

514
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,720
guess you would call it quarter steer oh
 

515
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,180

like pillars here all the way up so we

540
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,470
like pillars here all the way up so we
 

541
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,129
like pillars here all the way up so we
got it here like every step another one

542
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:38,139
got it here like every step another one
 

543
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,470
got it here like every step another one
there another one here and then this is

544
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
there another one here and then this is
 

545
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,780
there another one here and then this is
the last one there I did a I did a thing

what else should we do this area needs a
 

599
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,570
what else should we do this area needs a
few more leaves good I guess

600
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:11,580
few more leaves good I guess
 

601
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:21,710

think about this I just added in a
 

609
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,230
think about this I just added in a
little bit more structure to it so we

610
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
little bit more structure to it so we
 

611
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,960
little bit more structure to it so we
got the the Oaks slabs and stuff here

612
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:35,970
got the the Oaks slabs and stuff here
 

613
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,690
got the the Oaks slabs and stuff here
some more dark oak pillars and and stuff

like that I also put a backdrop in so

616
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:41,850
like that I also put a backdrop in so
 

617
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,340
like that I also put a backdrop in so
you can't see through the leaves anymore

618
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,350
you can't see through the leaves anymore
 

619
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,030
you can't see through the leaves anymore
I think that makes it a lot better and

620
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,040
I think that makes it a lot better and
 

621
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,130
I think that makes it a lot better and
if we go down through in some vines some

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,860
lilacs we need maybe some pink tulips
and some white tulips but otherwise I'd

626
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:54,870
and some white tulips but otherwise I'd
 

627
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,810

wall here so if there's anything that
 

633
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,950
wall here so if there's anything that
spawns it'll be trapped anyway which i

634
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:03,960
spawns it'll be trapped anyway which i
 

635
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,980

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,090
that on fences and on fence gates and
 

833
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,540
that on fences and on fence gates and
the cool thing about fence gates because

834
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:30,550
the cool thing about fence gates because
 

835
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,570
the cool thing about fence gates because
it's an entity like a like a moving

836
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:33,580
it's an entity like a like a moving
 

837
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,710
it's an entity like a like a moving

entity
 

839
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,180
entity
it'll actually fall through a fence gate

840
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,190
it'll actually fall through a fence gate
 

841
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,750
it'll actually fall through a fence gate
too and I think I tested this out on

842
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
too and I think I tested this out on
 

843
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,700
too and I think I tested this out on
creative and it was like crushing cows

844
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:43,710
creative and it was like crushing cows
 

845
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,909
creative and it was like crushing cows
and and stuff so I'm tempted maybe to

846
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:46,919
and and stuff so I'm tempted maybe to
 

847
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,980
and and stuff so I'm tempted maybe to
you to make a cattle crusher like I did

848
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:48,990
you to make a cattle crusher like I did
 

849
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,400
you to make a cattle crusher like I did
in my modded series because you can move

850
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,410
in my modded series because you can move
 

851
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,650
in my modded series because you can move
pit or you can move anvils upwards as

852
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:54,660
pit or you can move anvils upwards as
 

853
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,070
pit or you can move anvils upwards as
long as they are not in block form so I

854
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
long as they are not in block form so I
 

855
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,919
long as they are not in block form so I
think you could do like a cow crushing

856
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:00,929
think you could do like a cow crushing
 

857
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:05,419
