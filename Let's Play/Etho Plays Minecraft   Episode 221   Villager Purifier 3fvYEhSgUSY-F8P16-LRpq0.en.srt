00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
purifier thingamajig that we we started
 

287
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,309
purifier thingamajig that we we started
on last time so

288
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
on last time so
 

289
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,909
on last time so
last time we got these switches hooked

290
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
last time we got these switches hooked
 

291
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,070
last time we got these switches hooked
up we got one for the junction

292
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080

 

293
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,309

one path the one going this way goes for

294
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
one path the one going this way goes for
 

295
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,629
one path the one going this way goes for
the the zombie villagers and the path

296
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
the the zombie villagers and the path
 

297
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,950
the the zombie villagers and the path
that goes this way

298
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
that goes this way
 

299
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,309
that goes this way
is ooh burps is for the regular zombies

300
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
is ooh burps is for the regular zombies
 

301
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,270
is ooh burps is for the regular zombies
um and then we also have the switch for

302
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
um and then we also have the switch for
 

303
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,110
um and then we also have the switch for
the spawner to turn it on and off

304
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120

 

305
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,070

pretty cool so we kind of need to

306
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
pretty cool so we kind of need to
 

307
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,950
pretty cool so we kind of need to
separate

308
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
separate
 

309
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,550
separate
the zombie villagers because when they

310
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
the zombie villagers because when they
 

311
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,710
the zombie villagers because when they
convert to regular villagers

312
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
convert to regular villagers
 

313
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,510
convert to regular villagers
uh if they're zombie villagers next to

314
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
uh if they're zombie villagers next to
 

315
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,430
uh if they're zombie villagers next to
them they'll start killing the converted

316
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
them they'll start killing the converted
 

317
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,710
them they'll start killing the converted
ones so

318
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
ones so
 

319
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,670
ones so
gotta separate them and originally i was

320
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
gotta separate them and originally i was
 

321
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,189
gotta separate them and originally i was
going to do that with mine carts but we

322
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
going to do that with mine carts but we
 

323
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,189
going to do that with mine carts but we
found that they

324
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
found that they
 

325
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,350
found that they
oh there's one right there that they

326
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
oh there's one right there that they
 

327
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,350
oh there's one right there that they
leave the mine carts when they convert

328
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
leave the mine carts when they convert
 

329
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,270
leave the mine carts when they convert
so then i thought about doing it

330
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
so then i thought about doing it
 

331
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,749
so then i thought about doing it
like a detection system for when they

332
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
like a detection system for when they
 

333
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,390
like a detection system for when they
convert

334
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
convert
 

335
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,670
convert
to automatically indicate it somehow but

336
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
to automatically indicate it somehow but
 

337
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,950
to automatically indicate it somehow but
it's kind of redundant because we're

338
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
it's kind of redundant because we're
 

339
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,469
it's kind of redundant because we're
going to be in this area anyway and we

340
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
going to be in this area anyway and we
 

341
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,150
going to be in this area anyway and we
can just eyeball it

342
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
can just eyeball it
 

343
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,390
can just eyeball it
but the idea i have now

344
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
but the idea i have now
 

345
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,150
but the idea i have now
we're going to drop them one and a half

346
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
we're going to drop them one and a half
 

347
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,749
we're going to drop them one and a half
blocks so they can't go back

348
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
blocks so they can't go back
 

349
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,029
blocks so they can't go back
this way and then we're gonna have

350
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039

 

351
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,670

i think a half slabs like this all along

352
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
i think a half slabs like this all along
 

353
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,309
i think a half slabs like this all along
that's their path

354
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
that's their path
 

355
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,550
that's their path
and every like three blocks or so we're

356
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
and every like three blocks or so we're
 

357
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,430
and every like three blocks or so we're
gonna have a holding chamber for them

358
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440

 

359
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,149

uh i guess we'll put our first one here

360
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

 

361
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,029

okay and there'll be a piston behind

362
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
okay and there'll be a piston behind
 

363
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,430
okay and there'll be a piston behind
there

364
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
there
 

365
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,990
there
one two three another one here and we'll

366
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
one two three another one here and we'll
 

367
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,790
one two three another one here and we'll
just

368
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
just
 

369
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,190
just
we'll just set up like three of them or

370
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
we'll just set up like three of them or
 

371
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,190
we'll just set up like three of them or
so to test it first of all and if it

372
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
so to test it first of all and if it
 

373
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,910
so to test it first of all and if it
works we'll maybe have

374
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
works we'll maybe have
 

375
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,509
works we'll maybe have
i don't know how many i would want maybe

376
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
i don't know how many i would want maybe
 

377
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,509
i don't know how many i would want maybe
five total

378
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519

 

379
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,190

and another one there

380
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200

 

381
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,070

okay so this is how we're going to

382
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
okay so this is how we're going to
 

383
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,910
okay so this is how we're going to
separate them a villager

384
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
separate them a villager
 

385
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,630
separate them a villager
will come in and he there's going to be

386
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
will come in and he there's going to be
 

387
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,230
will come in and he there's going to be
like a layer of glass

388
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
like a layer of glass
 

389
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,070
like a layer of glass
over here by the way so it's going to be

390
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
over here by the way so it's going to be
 

391
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,829
over here by the way so it's going to be
one wide they'll walk

392
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
one wide they'll walk
 

393
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,990
one wide they'll walk
they should fall down there on their own

394
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
they should fall down there on their own
 

395
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,590
they should fall down there on their own
because they they don't take fall damage

396
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
because they they don't take fall damage
 

397
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,509
because they they don't take fall damage
from that drop

398
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
from that drop
 

399
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,910
from that drop
um we need some pressure plates going

400
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
um we need some pressure plates going
 

401
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,190
um we need some pressure plates going
here

402
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200

 

403
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,110

they'll fall down they'll land on a

404
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
they'll fall down they'll land on a
 

405
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,630
they'll fall down they'll land on a
pressure plate in a holding

406
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
pressure plate in a holding
 

407
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,310
pressure plate in a holding
chamber something like that

408
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
chamber something like that
 

409
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,910
chamber something like that
i'm going to have to adjust this a bit

410
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
i'm going to have to adjust this a bit
 

411
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,829
i'm going to have to adjust this a bit
though and when they step on this

412
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
though and when they step on this
 

413
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,310
though and when they step on this
pressure plate the piston will extend

414
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
pressure plate the piston will extend
 

415
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,310
pressure plate the piston will extend
and cover up the hole so that the next

416
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
and cover up the hole so that the next
 

417
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,949
and cover up the hole so that the next
one that comes will go to the next hole

418
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
one that comes will go to the next hole
 

419
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,790
one that comes will go to the next hole
and then the next one and we'll separate

420
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
and then the next one and we'll separate
 

421
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,870
and then the next one and we'll separate
them that way

422
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
them that way
 

423
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,389
them that way
and then when we remove them from the

424
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
and then when we remove them from the
 

425
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,389
and then when we remove them from the
holding chamber it's it frees up the

426
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
holding chamber it's it frees up the
 

427
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,070
holding chamber it's it frees up the
spot

428
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
spot
 

429
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,630
spot
so that's that's the kind of plan we got

430
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
so that's that's the kind of plan we got
 

431
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,750
so that's that's the kind of plan we got
for this

432
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
for this
 

433
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,590
for this
maybe i need to space them one more to

434
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600

 

435
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,990

i want to set up like a rail system for

436
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
i want to set up like a rail system for
 

437
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,990
i want to set up like a rail system for
getting them out of the holding chambers

438
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
getting them out of the holding chambers
 

439
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,190
getting them out of the holding chambers
um see

440
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
um see
 

441
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,710
um see
well first let's look at the redstone

442
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
well first let's look at the redstone
 

443
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,350
well first let's look at the redstone
how we're gonna have to do the redstone

444
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360

 

445
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,550

redstone will go here and

446
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560

 

447
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,710

gotta get up to the piston

448
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720

 

449
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,190

could use a torch i guess two torches

450
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200

 

451
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,030

all right i don't have redstone on me so

452
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
all right i don't have redstone on me so
 

453
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,829
all right i don't have redstone on me so
i'll wire this up and we'll check it out

454
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839

 

455
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,670

so this is one way we could do it just

456
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
so this is one way we could do it just
 

457
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,790
so this is one way we could do it just
to have redstone torch there and there

458
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

 

459
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,430

and if we put a block there

460
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440

 

461
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,269

ta-da very simple uh but the problem is

462
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
ta-da very simple uh but the problem is
 

463
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,509
ta-da very simple uh but the problem is
i do want to get them into carts somehow

464
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
i do want to get them into carts somehow
 

465
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:55,990
i do want to get them into carts somehow
and

466
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
and
 

467
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,670
and
it's a little tough to do it with this

468
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
it's a little tough to do it with this
 

469
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,829
it's a little tough to do it with this
because we can't put a rail where the

470
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
because we can't put a rail where the
 

471
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,310
because we can't put a rail where the
pressure plate is

472
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
pressure plate is
 

473
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,630
pressure plate is
so i think i might do it like this

474
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
so i think i might do it like this
 

475
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,550
so i think i might do it like this
instead

476
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
instead
 

477
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,190
instead
we got tripwire

478
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200

 

479
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,230

still does that but we can

480
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
still does that but we can
 

481
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,750
still does that but we can
put a power rail below and potentially a

482
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
put a power rail below and potentially a
 

483
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,949
put a power rail below and potentially a
dispenser with

484
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
dispenser with
 

485
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,990
dispenser with
with carts in right on that block there

486
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
with carts in right on that block there
 

487
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,150
with carts in right on that block there
so that when we when we power that the

488
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
so that when we when we power that the
 

489
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,230
so that when we when we power that the
power rail will power

490
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
power rail will power
 

491
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,509
power rail will power
and dispenser will shoot out a cart and

492
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
and dispenser will shoot out a cart and
 

493
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,750
and dispenser will shoot out a cart and
assuming there's a mob here the mob will

494
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
assuming there's a mob here the mob will
 

495
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,350
assuming there's a mob here the mob will
go into the cart i think

496
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
go into the cart i think
 

497
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,350
go into the cart i think
and pass through this trap door which

498
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
and pass through this trap door which
 

499
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
and pass through this trap door which
will be down like that so they can't

500
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
will be down like that so they can't
 

501
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,069
will be down like that so they can't
escape if they're not in the carts and

502
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
escape if they're not in the carts and
 

503
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,069
escape if they're not in the carts and
then go down our rail line that we set

504
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
then go down our rail line that we set
 

505
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,350
then go down our rail line that we set
up

506
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360

 

507
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,190

yeah so i think that's what we're going

508
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
yeah so i think that's what we're going
 

509
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,269
yeah so i think that's what we're going
to do problem with using

510
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
to do problem with using
 

511
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,269
to do problem with using
the trip wires though is they take up a

512
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
the trip wires though is they take up a
 

513
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,310
the trip wires though is they take up a
lot of space and it's going to be

514
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
lot of space and it's going to be
 

515
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,910
lot of space and it's going to be
uh five wide per each

516
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
uh five wide per each
 

517
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,269
uh five wide per each
thing i think

518
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279

 

519
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,870

five it's either four or five i'm not

520
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
five it's either four or five i'm not
 

521
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,310
five it's either four or five i'm not
sure i'm going to set up

522
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
sure i'm going to set up
 

523
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,590
sure i'm going to set up
three things here and then we'll test it

524
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
three things here and then we'll test it
 

525
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,790
three things here and then we'll test it
out and we'll put up

526
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
out and we'll put up
 

527
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,629
out and we'll put up
our glass uh wall here

528
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639

 

529
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,389

it'll be glass going all the way along

530
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
it'll be glass going all the way along
 

531
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,949
it'll be glass going all the way along
here a glass wall

532
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
here a glass wall
 

533
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,230
here a glass wall
all right and yeah we'll we'll check it

534
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
all right and yeah we'll we'll check it
 

535
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,670
all right and yeah we'll we'll check it
out once i get that set up

536
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680

 

537
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,670

i only set up two but it should be

538
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
i only set up two but it should be
 

539
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,350
i only set up two but it should be
enough to test it out

540
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
enough to test it out
 

541
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,910
enough to test it out
uh just to see if the idea works or not

542
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
uh just to see if the idea works or not
 

543
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,910
uh just to see if the idea works or not
this one's good

544
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
this one's good
 

545
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,990
this one's good
and that one's good okay

546
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
and that one's good okay
 

547
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,790
and that one's good okay
so we're just gonna send regular zombies

548
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
so we're just gonna send regular zombies
 

549
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,670
so we're just gonna send regular zombies
through there they'll

550
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
through there they'll
 

551
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,870
through there they'll
they'll work the same as zombie

552
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
they'll work the same as zombie
 

553
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,350
they'll work the same as zombie
villagers anyway um

554
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
villagers anyway um
 

555
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,269
villagers anyway um
so we'll flip that up so they go that

556
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
so we'll flip that up so they go that
 

557
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,470
so we'll flip that up so they go that
way

558
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
way
 

559
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,590
way
and turn it on

560
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
and turn it on
 

561
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,389
and turn it on
and switch it back let's see what

562
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
and switch it back let's see what
 

563
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,190
and switch it back let's see what
happens

564
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200

 

565
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,509

will only one go down or we'll will a

566
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
will only one go down or we'll will a
 

567
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,990
will only one go down or we'll will a
few get stuck in one holding areas

568
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
few get stuck in one holding areas
 

569
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,030
few get stuck in one holding areas
one thing we gotta watch for

570
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
one thing we gotta watch for
 

571
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,190
one thing we gotta watch for
uh will their pathfinding allow them to

572
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
uh will their pathfinding allow them to
 

573
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,150
uh will their pathfinding allow them to
move

574
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
move
 

575
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,509
move

601
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,670

ready for a retry

602
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680

 

603
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,350

i also brought a cart with me because we

604
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
i also brought a cart with me because we
 

605
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,110
i also brought a cart with me because we
can see what happens

606
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
can see what happens
 

607
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,030
can see what happens
if we put the card in there with them

608
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040

 

609
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,629

i'm a little worried though their path

610
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
i'm a little worried though their path
 

611
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,069
i'm a little worried though their path
findings preventing them from

612
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
findings preventing them from
 

613
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,350
findings preventing them from
moving forward

614
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360

 

615
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,790

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
takes a while to get there
 

627
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,670
takes a while to get there
if i really want i could put water

628
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
if i really want i could put water
 

629
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,310
if i really want i could put water
streams to force them through

630
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
streams to force them through
 

631
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,550
streams to force them through
i think but yeah let's let's put a

632
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
i think but yeah let's let's put a
 

633
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,509
i think but yeah let's let's put a
minecart here

634
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519

 

635
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,550

okay and then we'll try power it

636
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
okay and then we'll try power it
 

637
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,110
okay and then we'll try power it
uh i don't think they enter its if you

638
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
uh i don't think they enter its if you
 

639
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,310
uh i don't think they enter its if you
just place it on them

640
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
just place it on them
 

641
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,030
just place it on them
it needs motion

642
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040

 

643
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,509

is there no block behind there that

644
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
is there no block behind there that
 

645
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,350
is there no block behind there that
should make it move

646
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360

 

647
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,790

what

648
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800

 

649
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,110

that was weird

650
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120

 

651
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,829

huh i wonder why the minecart didn't

652
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
huh i wonder why the minecart didn't
 

653
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,350
huh i wonder why the minecart didn't
move

654
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360

 

655
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,470

that's not a redstone torch

656
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480

 

657
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,269

we might have a problem with this

658
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279

 

659
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,990

guys don't want can you not see me when

665
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,069

well i guess we won't know for sure if

666
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
well i guess we won't know for sure if
 

667
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,990
well i guess we won't know for sure if
it works until we set up a dispenser in

668
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
it works until we set up a dispenser in
 

669
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,350
it works until we set up a dispenser in
there and try it

670
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
there and try it
 

671
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,949
there and try it
i should go back and look for one

672
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
i should go back and look for one
 

673
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,629
i should go back and look for one
but yeah i'm gonna have i guess two

674
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
but yeah i'm gonna have i guess two
 

675
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,230
but yeah i'm gonna have i guess two
chambers here they do take up a lot of

676
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
chambers here they do take up a lot of
 

677
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,670
chambers here they do take up a lot of
space each one

678
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
space each one
 

679
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,629
space each one
so i'm gonna have two chambers and then

680
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
so i'm gonna have two chambers and then
 

681
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,829
so i'm gonna have two chambers and then
maybe two

682
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
maybe two
 

683
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,670
maybe two
on this wall and two on this one for a

684
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
on this wall and two on this one for a
 

685

but until we get our block positions
 

779
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,430
but until we get our block positions
figured out that's just

figured out that's just
what we're gonna use how's it look if we

782
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
what we're gonna use how's it look if we
 

783

um yeah that's i think that's what we'll

860
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
um yeah that's i think that's what we'll
 

861
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,909
um yeah that's i think that's what we'll
do

862
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919

 

863
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,110

cool

864
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120

 

865
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,390

all right here's a better idea of what

866
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
all right here's a better idea of what
 

867
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,390
all right here's a better idea of what
we're going to be doing with this

868
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
we're going to be doing with this
 

869
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,710
we're going to be doing with this
switch this to the stone slabs they look

870
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
switch this to the stone slabs they look
 

871
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,310
switch this to the stone slabs they look
pretty good

872
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
pretty good
 

873
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,669
pretty good
um i gotta duplicate like this half of

874
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
um i gotta duplicate like this half of
 

875
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,190
um i gotta duplicate like this half of
the room over to the right here that

876
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
the room over to the right here that
 

877
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,870
the room over to the right here that
we're gonna have a tunnel that goes out

878
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
we're gonna have a tunnel that goes out
 

879
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,070
we're gonna have a tunnel that goes out
here

880
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
here
 

881
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,350
here
and up to the surface or something

882
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
and up to the surface or something
 

883
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,029
and up to the surface or something
although i hmm zombies burn in the day

884
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
although i hmm zombies burn in the day
 

885
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,789
although i hmm zombies burn in the day
so maybe not to the surface

886
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
so maybe not to the surface
 

887
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,230
so maybe not to the surface
but there'll be a tunnel here um

888
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240

 

889
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,710

we'll have this pathway that they're

890
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
we'll have this pathway that they're
 

891
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,669
we'll have this pathway that they're
following here it'll

892
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
following here it'll
 

893
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,390
following here it'll
it'll do a full full square around the

894
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
it'll do a full full square around the
 

895
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,830
it'll do a full full square around the
room

896
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
room
 

897
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,350
room
i think and then we'll go underneath it

898
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
i think and then we'll go underneath it
 

899
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,149
i think and then we'll go underneath it
to get to this

900
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
to get to this
 

901
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,350
to get to this
parts over here which will probably be

902
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
parts over here which will probably be
 

903
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,350
parts over here which will probably be
lowered

904
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
lowered
 

905
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,549
lowered
um this is the

906
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
um this is the
 

907
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,909
um this is the
the tripwire hooked up to these

908
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
the tripwire hooked up to these
 

909
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,669
the tripwire hooked up to these
glowstone or to the lamps

910
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679

 

911
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,149

and i did that like this i have two

912
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
and i did that like this i have two
 

913
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,310
and i did that like this i have two
redstone torches that's

914
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
redstone torches that's
 

915
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,950
redstone torches that's
that's split off here and this just

916
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
that's split off here and this just
 

917
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,149
that's split off here and this just
connects up to the

918
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
connects up to the
 

919
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,310
connects up to the
the tripwire up there

920
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320

 

921
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,590

in fact just reading the comments i

1010
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
in fact just reading the comments i
 

1011
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,830
in fact just reading the comments i
messed up so i i restarted

1012

first lp episodes and compare them to
 

1023
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,029
first lp episodes and compare them to
now
