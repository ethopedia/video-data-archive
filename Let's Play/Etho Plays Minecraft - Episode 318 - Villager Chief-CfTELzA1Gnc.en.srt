pretty easily so what I do this is the
 

395
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,949
pretty easily so what I do this is the
multitasking when I need nether quartz I

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
multitasking when I need nether quartz I
 

397
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,710
multitasking when I need nether quartz I
like to come here

398
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
like to come here
 

399
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
like to come here
and as I'm prepping this area for wither

400
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,210
and as I'm prepping this area for wither
 

401
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,210
and as I'm prepping this area for wither
skeletons I like it oops I didn't need

as I clear out the land and I can get
 

415
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,670
as I clear out the land and I can get
the nether quartz which is in my opinion

416
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:34,680
the nether quartz which is in my opinion
 

417
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,650
the nether quartz which is in my opinion
a lot more enjoyable than doing nether

418
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
a lot more enjoyable than doing nether
 

419
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,390
a lot more enjoyable than doing nether
quartz hunting so that's what I've been

420
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,400
quartz hunting so that's what I've been
 

421
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,760
quartz hunting so that's what I've been
doing and it's been working out pretty

422
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:43,770
doing and it's been working out pretty
 

423
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,420
doing and it's been working out pretty
good

424
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,430
good
 

425
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,730
good
but this area is turning into quite the

426
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:49,740
but this area is turning into quite the
 

427
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:56,060
but this area is turning into quite the
wither skeleton spawning area so let's

428
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,070
wither skeleton spawning area so let's
 

429
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,330
wither skeleton spawning area so let's
see awed by the way this this fortress

430
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,340
see awed by the way this this fortress
 

431
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,550
see awed by the way this this fortress
used to have like netherrack all over

432
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,560
used to have like netherrack all over
 

433
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,500
used to have like netherrack all over
the top of it it's all gone now because

434
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,510
the top of it it's all gone now because
 

435
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,440
the top of it it's all gone now because
I've cleared it out you can see like how

436
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,450
I've cleared it out you can see like how
 

437
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,030
I've cleared it out you can see like how
high the nether rack is there that used

438
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,040
high the nether rack is there that used
 

439
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,060
high the nether rack is there that used
to be land all the way up up to there I

440
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,070
to be land all the way up up to there I
 

441
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,800
to be land all the way up up to there I
believe and there was there's pretty

442
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:15,810
believe and there was there's pretty
 

443
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,450
believe and there was there's pretty
much netherrack over top all these

444
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:17,460
much netherrack over top all these
 

445
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
much netherrack over top all these
walkways but there's not anymore it's

446
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,470
walkways but there's not anymore it's
 

447
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,580
walkways but there's not anymore it's
all opening can easily see wither

448
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:22,590
all opening can easily see wither
 

449
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,990
all opening can easily see wither
skeletons whenever they spawn oh that

450
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,000
skeletons whenever they spawn oh that
 

451
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,580
skeletons whenever they spawn oh that
looked like it we got it but we didn't

452
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,590
looked like it we got it but we didn't
 

453

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:33,990
do here yet like we can prep these
 

457
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,270

me I want to start knocking down these

464
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,210
me I want to start knocking down these
 

465
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,710
me I want to start knocking down these
walls inside like we have all these

466
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
walls inside like we have all these
 

467
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,990
walls inside like we have all these
rooms that are sort of not getting used

468
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,000
rooms that are sort of not getting used
 

469
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
rooms that are sort of not getting used
by me at the moment because they're just

470
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,410
by me at the moment because they're just
 

471
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,190
by me at the moment because they're just
so hard to see there's wither skeletons

472
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
so hard to see there's wither skeletons
 

473
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,280
so hard to see there's wither skeletons
on the inside here but if we start like

474
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,290
on the inside here but if we start like
 

475
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,440
on the inside here but if we start like
taking down the walls it'll become a

476
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,450
taking down the walls it'll become a
 

477
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,380
taking down the walls it'll become a
nice big flat area where they can spawn

478

good for us to get some of the door
 

517
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,650
good for us to get some of the door
rights and stuff instead of using our

518

rights and stuff instead of using our
 

519
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,340
rights and stuff instead of using our
nether courts to make it so Oh

520
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,350

 

521

523
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,560
okay I think we might be in an ocean we
spawned underground let's go check this

524
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,570
spawned underground let's go check this
 

525
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,920
spawned underground let's go check this
out but yeah look this is good this is

526
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:25,930
out but yeah look this is good this is
 

527

what I wanted nice place to get this
 

529
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,430
what I wanted nice place to get this
stuff instead of having to make it

530
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
stuff instead of having to make it
 

531

I think that's one of the reasons I made

636
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,170
I think that's one of the reasons I made
 

637
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,520
I think that's one of the reasons I made
the gold farm is for beacons and now I

638
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,530
the gold farm is for beacons and now I
 

639
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,530
the gold farm is for beacons and now I
find one I like stand here for example

640
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:28,540
find one I like stand here for example
 

641
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,590
find one I like stand here for example
here let's get some light down just

642
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
here let's get some light down just
 

643
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,540
here let's get some light down just
temporarily when I stand like around

644
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,550
temporarily when I stand like around
 

645
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,480
temporarily when I stand like around
here a lot of the guys from the second

646
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,490
here a lot of the guys from the second
 

647
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,360
here a lot of the guys from the second
layer will come down these stairs even

648
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,370
layer will come down these stairs even
 

649
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,840
layer will come down these stairs even
hey they can like paths fine to me now

650
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:42,850
hey they can like paths fine to me now
 

651
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,390
hey they can like paths fine to me now
so that's cool so getting rid of the

652
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,400
so that's cool so getting rid of the
 

653
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,830
so that's cool so getting rid of the
walls seems to be helping quite a bit so

654
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:49,840
walls seems to be helping quite a bit so
 

655
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,740
walls seems to be helping quite a bit so
the one more thing well I'm going to be

656
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:52,750
the one more thing well I'm going to be
 

657
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,370
the one more thing well I'm going to be
doing a lot of things here still but one

658
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,380
doing a lot of things here still but one
 

659
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,120
doing a lot of things here still but one
big thing I got to do there's there's

660
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,130
big thing I got to do there's there's
 

661
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,940
big thing I got to do there's there's
these intersections like this these are

662
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:02,950
these intersections like this these are
 

663
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,670
these intersections like this these are
the really good ones these will spawn

664
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:05,680
the really good ones these will spawn
 

665
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,700
the really good ones these will spawn
withers within the 19 by 19 area

666
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,710
withers within the 19 by 19 area
 

667
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,150
withers within the 19 by 19 area
centered over here and you hat can get

668
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
centered over here and you hat can get
 

669
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,270
centered over here and you hat can get
up to like four layers so what is that

670
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
up to like four layers so what is that
 

671
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,150
up to like four layers so what is that
tattoo later time 19 times 19 times for

672
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
tattoo later time 19 times 19 times for
 

673
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,220
tattoo later time 19 times 19 times for
fourteen hundred and forty four spawning

674
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,230
fourteen hundred and forty four spawning
 

675
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,950
fourteen hundred and forty four spawning
spaces for wither skeletons at each of

676
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:25,960
spaces for wither skeletons at each of
 

677
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,530
spaces for wither skeletons at each of
these intersections which is pretty

678
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:28,540
these intersections which is pretty
 

679
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,990
these intersections which is pretty
crazy so we have one of them over there

680
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,000
crazy so we have one of them over there
 

681
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,190
crazy so we have one of them over there
there's one over on at this end they're

682
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,200
there's one over on at this end they're
 

683
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,410
there's one over on at this end they're
kind of spaced out too which is also

684
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:40,420
kind of spaced out too which is also
 

685
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
kind of spaced out too which is also
good because

686
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,430
good because
 

687
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,470
good because
when I run to one end of this fortress

688
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
when I run to one end of this fortress
 

689
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,660
when I run to one end of this fortress
skeletons will like all the Pigman and

690
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,670
skeletons will like all the Pigman and
 

691
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,160
skeletons will like all the Pigman and
stuff that have spawned over here will

692
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,170
stuff that have spawned over here will
 

693
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,070
stuff that have spawned over here will
despawn because I get far away and then

694
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
despawn because I get far away and then
 

695
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
despawn because I get far away and then
we can kill the withers over there and

696
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,090
we can kill the withers over there and
 

697
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,730
we can kill the withers over there and
then when we come back though all the

698
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:55,740
then when we come back though all the
 

699
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,440
then when we come back though all the
Pigman that spawned over on that side of

700
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,450
Pigman that spawned over on that side of
 

701
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,990
Pigman that spawned over on that side of
the fortress will be spawn and we get a

702
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
the fortress will be spawn and we get a
 

703
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
the fortress will be spawn and we get a
bunch of wither skeletons on this side

704
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:01,530
bunch of wither skeletons on this side
 

705
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,310
bunch of wither skeletons on this side
so it's ideally you want to be like

706
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
so it's ideally you want to be like
 

707
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,990
so it's ideally you want to be like
running back and forth in a fortress so

708
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
running back and forth in a fortress so
 

709
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,210
running back and forth in a fortress so
you don't want to just be in one spot so

710
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,220
you don't want to just be in one spot so
 

711
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,100
you don't want to just be in one spot so
this is going to be good when it's all

712
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,110
this is going to be good when it's all
 

713
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,750
this is going to be good when it's all
done so we got one here I'm not quite

714
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:14,760
done so we got one here I'm not quite
 

715
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,440
done so we got one here I'm not quite
sure how this looked before I made these

716
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,450
sure how this looked before I made these
 

717
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,650
sure how this looked before I made these
initial changes but I think this might

718
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660
initial changes but I think this might
 

719
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,850
initial changes but I think this might
be one like a long time ago I smooth

720
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:25,860
be one like a long time ago I smooth
 

721
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,710
be one like a long time ago I smooth
some of this out so I'm not exactly sure

722
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:27,720
some of this out so I'm not exactly sure
 

723
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,050
some of this out so I'm not exactly sure
what intersection this was but I think

724
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,060
what intersection this was but I think
 

725
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,570
what intersection this was but I think
this was one there might be one over

726
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:32,580
this was one there might be one over
 

727
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,110
this was one there might be one over
there too

728
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
there too
 

729
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,390
there too
these these with the overhang are a

730
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
these these with the overhang are a
 

731
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,950
these these with the overhang are a
little different they don't get the 19

732
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:39,960
little different they don't get the 19
 

733
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,850
little different they don't get the 19
by 19 yeah so many wither skeletons I

734
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:46,860
by 19 yeah so many wither skeletons I
 

735
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,290
by 19 yeah so many wither skeletons I
just wish there wasn't all these blazes

736
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,300
just wish there wasn't all these blazes
 

737
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,430
just wish there wasn't all these blazes
they're so annoying

738
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
they're so annoying
 

739
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
they're so annoying
OOP they've got the torch they don't

740
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,170
OOP they've got the torch they don't
 

741
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,700
OOP they've got the torch they don't
spawn if there's light so unfortunately

742
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,710
spawn if there's light so unfortunately
 

743
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,320
spawn if there's light so unfortunately
the nether is really dark for YouTube

744
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,330
the nether is really dark for YouTube
 

745
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:04,830
the nether is really dark for YouTube
though and there was one more

746
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:04,840

 

747
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,690

these guys working so good oh look yeah

748
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:10,700
these guys working so good oh look yeah
 

749
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,119
these guys working so good oh look yeah
you can see the withers in there now so

750
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,129
you can see the withers in there now so
 

751
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:15,909
you can see the withers in there now so
many withers whether it's skeletons

752
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
many withers whether it's skeletons
 

753
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,789
many withers whether it's skeletons
there's one more over here so that's

754
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
there's one more over here so that's
 

755
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,009
there's one more over here so that's
like five of these intersections where I

756
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:21,019
like five of these intersections where I
 

757
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,139
like five of these intersections where I
can get over a thousand spawning spaces

758
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:23,149
can get over a thousand spawning spaces
 

759
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:25,320
can get over a thousand spawning spaces
if I if I want to take advantage of them

760
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,330
if I if I want to take advantage of them
 

761
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,879
if I if I want to take advantage of them
then you got all this area inside yeah

762
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:30,889
then you got all this area inside yeah
 

763
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,860
then you got all this area inside yeah
this is going to be a really good firm

764
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:32,870
this is going to be a really good firm
 

765
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,590
this is going to be a really good firm
when I get it all done but I think let's

766
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:38,600
when I get it all done but I think let's
 

767
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,759
when I get it all done but I think let's
go on over to the village I want to do

768
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:42,769
go on over to the village I want to do
 

769
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:48,460
go on over to the village I want to do
some stuff at the village today okay so

770
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,470
some stuff at the village today okay so
 

771
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,200
some stuff at the village today okay so
we don't have a lot of time to spend on

772
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,210
we don't have a lot of time to spend on
 

773
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,610
we don't have a lot of time to spend on
this today but I think we can get

774
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:51,620
this today but I think we can get
 

775
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,889
this today but I think we can get
started so this is the underground

776
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:53,899
started so this is the underground
 

777
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:57,549
started so this is the underground
village and as you know there's new

778
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:57,559
village and as you know there's new
 

779
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,840
village and as you know there's new
trading in the new snapshots like

780
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:00,850
trading in the new snapshots like
 

781
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,149
trading in the new snapshots like
there's new villager subtypes and I want

782
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
there's new villager subtypes and I want
 

783
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,879
there's new villager subtypes and I want
to try get some of the new villagers

784
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:06,889
to try get some of the new villagers
 

785
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:10,299
to try get some of the new villagers
going problem is this village has

786
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:10,309
going problem is this village has
 

787
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,580
going problem is this village has
reached maximum population we can't get

788
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:12,590
reached maximum population we can't get
 

789
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,769
reached maximum population we can't get
more villagers I don't think until we

790
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:14,779
more villagers I don't think until we
 

791
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:19,419
more villagers I don't think until we
get rid of some of them so I have come

792
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:19,429
get rid of some of them so I have come
 

793
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,049
get rid of some of them so I have come

the other villagers they will also get
 

871
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,509
the other villagers they will also get
exported from the village and they will

872
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:35,519
exported from the village and they will
 

873
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,539
exported from the village and they will
go to a cryogenics lab that we're going

874
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:38,549
go to a cryogenics lab that we're going
 

875
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:39,619
go to a cryogenics lab that we're going
to build it in the nether

876
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:39,629
to build it in the nether
 

877
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,919
to build it in the nether
so we'll push the good villagers like

878
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:42,929
so we'll push the good villagers like
 

879
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,509

the ones with the really good trades
 

881
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,659
the ones with the really good trades
we'll push into the nether through a

882
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:47,669
we'll push into the nether through a
 

883
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:51,159
we'll push into the nether through a
portal and we will store them in

884
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:51,169
portal and we will store them in
 

885
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,979
portal and we will store them in
cryogenic ice yeah that's the plan and

886
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:54,989
cryogenic ice yeah that's the plan and
 

887
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:59,950
cryogenic ice yeah that's the plan and
they should stay alive that way for sure

888
00:22:59,950 --> 00:22:59,960
they should stay alive that way for sure
 

889
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,499
they should stay alive that way for sure
okay so let's do maybe we'll do indented

890
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:03,509
okay so let's do maybe we'll do indented
 

891
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:10,879
okay so let's do maybe we'll do indented
eyes like so and hopefully I did that

892
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:10,889
eyes like so and hopefully I did that
 

893
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:17,330
eyes like so and hopefully I did that
right go this way wait wait yeah like

894
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:17,340
right go this way wait wait yeah like
 

895
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,600
right go this way wait wait yeah like
that

896
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:19,610

 

897
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,340

these are the Chiti emerald blocks by

898
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,350
these are the Chiti emerald blocks by
 

899
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,450
these are the Chiti emerald blocks by
the way that's why I'm using them for

900
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,460
the way that's why I'm using them for
 

901
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,710
the way that's why I'm using them for
building and see that goes like that

902
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:29,720
building and see that goes like that
 

903
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,350
building and see that goes like that
hopefully this looks pretty good let's

904

919
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,130
forehead but I don't know if we'll have
enough space he looks like he's just

920
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,140
enough space he looks like he's just
 

921
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,560
enough space he looks like he's just
barely fitting in um yeah let's do this

922
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,570
barely fitting in um yeah let's do this
 

923
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,830
barely fitting in um yeah let's do this
kind of make that indented - I guess we

924
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:12,840
kind of make that indented - I guess we
 

925
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,940
kind of make that indented - I guess we
can do that that's probably good all

926
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:16,950
can do that that's probably good all
 

927
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,160
can do that that's probably good all
right now we'll go up one more block

928
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,170
right now we'll go up one more block
 

929
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,260
right now we'll go up one more block
since we have the space might remove

930
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,270
since we have the space might remove
 

931
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,090
since we have the space might remove
some of the ceiling here and so that you

952
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,230
with that maybe let's let's indent the
 

953
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:19,190
with that maybe let's let's indent the
emerald eyes one more block and pretend

954
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
emerald eyes one more block and pretend
 

955
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,340
emerald eyes one more block and pretend
we have a dispenser right where I put

956
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,350
we have a dispenser right where I put
 

957
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,370
we have a dispenser right where I put
that block facing upwards with a water

958
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,380
that block facing upwards with a water
 

959
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,680
that block facing upwards with a water
bucket inside and that will run out the

960
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:27,690
bucket inside and that will run out the
 

961
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,770
bucket inside and that will run out the
front when we when we pulse it

962
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:31,780
front when we when we pulse it
 

963
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,200
front when we when we pulse it
let's bring this up like that that's

964
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,210
let's bring this up like that that's
 

965
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,230
let's bring this up like that that's
probably good I think that'll work the

966
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
probably good I think that'll work the
 

967
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,570
probably good I think that'll work the
dispenser down there

968
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,580
dispenser down there
 

969
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,440
dispenser down there
hopefully the eye doesn't look too

970
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,450
hopefully the eye doesn't look too
 

971
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,820
hopefully the eye doesn't look too
messed up with it invented like that I

972
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,830

 

973
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,650

think that's okay oh you know what we

974
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:52,660
think that's okay oh you know what we
 

975
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,150
think that's okay oh you know what we
can do it better we can get one more

976
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,160
can do it better we can get one more
 

977
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:05,820
can do it better we can get one more
block over here yeah in and out okay so

978
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:05,830
block over here yeah in and out okay so
 

979
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,260
block over here yeah in and out okay so
we just got to get dispensers and water

980
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,270
we just got to get dispensers and water
 

981
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,300
we just got to get dispensers and water
budgets and I should take away more of

982
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,310
budgets and I should take away more of
 

983
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,950
budgets and I should take away more of
the ceiling I'll be right back

984
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:16,960
the ceiling I'll be right back
 

985
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,060
the ceiling I'll be right back
oh ho you know what we almost missed a

986
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,070
oh ho you know what we almost missed a
 

987
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,370
oh ho you know what we almost missed a
really important detail with our

988
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,380
really important detail with our
 

989
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,160
really important detail with our
villager chief can't be a villager chief

990
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,170
villager chief can't be a villager chief
 

991
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,570
villager chief can't be a villager chief
without a very proud unibrow in the

992
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:30,580
without a very proud unibrow in the
 

993
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,140
without a very proud unibrow in the
villager world's the unibrow is like a

994
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,150
villager world's the unibrow is like a
 

995
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,390
villager world's the unibrow is like a
lion's mane that's how they show their

996
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
lion's mane that's how they show their

strong of an individual they are the

1000
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:42,850
strong of an individual they are the
 

1001
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,240
strong of an individual they are the
stronger the unibrow is stronger the

1002
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,250
stronger the unibrow is stronger the
 

1003
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,540
stronger the unibrow is stronger the
individual very distinguished okay so I

1004
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:50,550
individual very distinguished okay so I
 

1005
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:57,660
individual very distinguished okay so I
hooked up the tear ducts so haven't

1006
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:57,670
hooked up the tear ducts so haven't
 

1007
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,350
hooked up the tear ducts so haven't
thought this through

1008
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,360
thought this through
 

1009
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,890
thought this through
totally like all the details but either

1010
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:01,900
totally like all the details but either
 

1011
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
totally like all the details but either
we're going to trigger this ourselves

1012
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:03,910
we're going to trigger this ourselves
 

1013
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,160
we're going to trigger this ourselves
somehow like

1014
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,170

 

1015
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,710

we'll we'll check if we need to export a

1016
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
we'll we'll check if we need to export a
 

1017
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,330
we'll we'll check if we need to export a
villager and they'll be like a random

1018
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,340
villager and they'll be like a random
 

1019
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,330
villager and they'll be like a random
chance he'll start crying if it's a yes

1020
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:15,340
chance he'll start crying if it's a yes
 

1021
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,460
chance he'll start crying if it's a yes
or we might figure out some way of him

1022
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,470
or we might figure out some way of him
 

1023
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,200
or we might figure out some way of him
doing it automatically on his own I'm

1024
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,210
doing it automatically on his own I'm
 

1025
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,000
doing it automatically on his own I'm
not sure I haven't thought it out I

1026
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,010
not sure I haven't thought it out I
 

1027
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,620
not sure I haven't thought it out I
think when he does start crying we

1028
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:25,630
think when he does start crying we
 

1029
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,180
think when he does start crying we
should have sent some note blocks

1030
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,190
should have sent some note blocks
 

1031
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,670
should have sent some note blocks
playing and also it will open up like an

1032
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:32,680
playing and also it will open up like an
 

1033
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,000
playing and also it will open up like an
elevator to the surface for the villager

1034
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,010
elevator to the surface for the villager
 

1035
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,680
elevator to the surface for the villager
and similarly when we transcend the

1036
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:40,690
and similarly when we transcend the
 

1037
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,610
and similarly when we transcend the
villager to the cryogenic lab that we're

1038
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:44,620
villager to the cryogenic lab that we're
 

1039
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,330
villager to the cryogenic lab that we're
going to build um we're going to have a

1040
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:48,340
going to build um we're going to have a
 

1041
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,930
going to build um we're going to have a
portal open up somewhere and we'll

1042
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:51,940
portal open up somewhere and we'll
 

1043
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,820
portal open up somewhere and we'll
probably also send iron golems to the

1044
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:53,830
probably also send iron golems to the
 

1045
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,150
probably also send iron golems to the
lab and sort of collect them there that

1046
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,160
lab and sort of collect them there that
 

1047
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,510
lab and sort of collect them there that
way new ones can spawn in our village

1048
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
way new ones can spawn in our village
 

1049
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,600
way new ones can spawn in our village
but yeah I'm thinking too far into the

1050
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,610
but yeah I'm thinking too far into the
 

1051
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,220
but yeah I'm thinking too far into the
future with something I haven't to work

1052
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,230
future with something I haven't to work
 

1053
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,860
future with something I haven't to work
