was fine but I found if you're going for

318
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:23,830
was fine but I found if you're going for
 

319
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,450
was fine but I found if you're going for
efficiency if you just want to get as

320
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:27,460
efficiency if you just want to get as
 

321
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,460
efficiency if you just want to get as
much as you can I think the best way of

322
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,470
much as you can I think the best way of
 

323
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,959
much as you can I think the best way of
doing is probably to dig it

324
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:32,969
doing is probably to dig it
 

325
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,459
doing is probably to dig it
y12 I'm guessing I meant wrong pick

326
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:38,469
y12 I'm guessing I meant wrong pick
 

327
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,709
y12 I'm guessing I meant wrong pick
that's fortune so yeah if you have

328
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
that's fortune so yeah if you have
 

329
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,480
that's fortune so yeah if you have
efficiency five and hey Stu you can mine

330
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,490
efficiency five and hey Stu you can mine
 

331
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,800
efficiency five and hey Stu you can mine
do the super mining thing which is

332
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:46,810
do the super mining thing which is
 

333
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,080
do the super mining thing which is
amazing I love it

334
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,090
amazing I love it
 

335
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,810
amazing I love it
I do have speed - yep

336
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:51,820
I do have speed - yep
 

337
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,880
I do have speed - yep
so what you do you just go instead of

338
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,890
so what you do you just go instead of
 

339
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,500
so what you do you just go instead of
doing little branches all over the place

340
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,510
doing little branches all over the place
 

341
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,540
doing little branches all over the place
just take everything out sort of - high

342
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,550
just take everything out sort of - high
 

343
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,320
just take everything out sort of - high
area if you can and it won't be long

344
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,330
area if you can and it won't be long
 

345
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,300

you'll get it pretty crazy how much you

346
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,310
you'll get it pretty crazy how much you
 

347
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,770
you'll get it pretty crazy how much you
can actually get from doing this I

348
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:10,780
can actually get from doing this I
 

349
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,940
can actually get from doing this I
believe that more redstone and you can

350
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:14,950
believe that more redstone and you can
 

351
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,530
believe that more redstone and you can
go a long ways away from that beacon

352
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:16,540
go a long ways away from that beacon
 

353
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,430
go a long ways away from that beacon
before you have to move it again

354
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
before you have to move it again
 

355
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,420
before you have to move it again
definitely got to watch out for lava

356
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,430
definitely got to watch out for lava
 

357
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,310
definitely got to watch out for lava
though you might want a fire protection

358
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,320
though you might want a fire protection
 

359
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,510
though you might want a fire protection
on your armor if you're doing this

360
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:26,520
on your armor if you're doing this
 

361
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,550
on your armor if you're doing this
yes what's the time it's pretty easy to

362
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,560
yes what's the time it's pretty easy to
 

363
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,730
yes what's the time it's pretty easy to
avoid the lab I find oops so when you do

364
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:32,740
avoid the lab I find oops so when you do
 

365
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,050
avoid the lab I find oops so when you do
come across something you want like

366
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,060
come across something you want like
 

367
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,190
come across something you want like
redstone take out your fortune pick line

368
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,200
redstone take out your fortune pick line
 

369
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,160
redstone take out your fortune pick line
it up and once your inventory is all

370
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,170
it up and once your inventory is all
 

371
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,400
it up and once your inventory is all
full then you can drop stuff off and

372
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,410
full then you can drop stuff off and
 

373
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,070
full then you can drop stuff off and
yeah just from just from mining redstone

374
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,080
yeah just from just from mining redstone
 

375
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,230
yeah just from just from mining redstone
in that I find it yet you can get 33

376
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,240
in that I find it yet you can get 33
 

377
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,270
in that I find it yet you can get 33
levels pretty quickly before year like

378
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:54,280
levels pretty quickly before year like
 

379
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,880
levels pretty quickly before year like
before this pick runs out of juice even

380
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:58,890
before this pick runs out of juice even
 

381
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,400
before this pick runs out of juice even
ten levels already there's more redstone

382
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,410
ten levels already there's more redstone
 

383
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,250
ten levels already there's more redstone
and if you do this swiping motion left

384
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,260
and if you do this swiping motion left
 

385
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,820
and if you do this swiping motion left
and right so you don't usually break the

386
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:07,830
and right so you don't usually break the
 

387
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,020
and right so you don't usually break the
the redstone or whatever block you

388
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,030
the redstone or whatever block you
 

389
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,460
the redstone or whatever block you
uncover I find emerald so they break

390
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,470
uncover I find emerald so they break
 

391
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,050
uncover I find emerald so they break
pretty quickly so you might have to be

392
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,060
pretty quickly so you might have to be
 

393
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,330
pretty quickly so you might have to be
more careful if you're if you're trying

394
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:18,340
more careful if you're if you're trying
 

395
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,210
more careful if you're if you're trying
to keep your emeralds from breaking and

396
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,220
to keep your emeralds from breaking and
 

397
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,140
to keep your emeralds from breaking and
yeah

398
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,150
yeah
 

399
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,060
yeah
it goes pretty good yeah if you get iron

400
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,070
it goes pretty good yeah if you get iron
 

401
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,100
it goes pretty good yeah if you get iron
quick doing this gold quick but

402
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,110
quick doing this gold quick but
 

403
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,200
quick doing this gold quick but
especially redstone and unmentionable

404
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,210
especially redstone and unmentionable
 

405
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,550
especially redstone and unmentionable
blue stuff the diamonds pretty cool so I

406
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
blue stuff the diamonds pretty cool so I
 

407
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,280
blue stuff the diamonds pretty cool so I
think I think the way I'm gonna be doing

408
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,290
think I think the way I'm gonna be doing
 

409
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,590
think I think the way I'm gonna be doing
it that's probably the most efficient to

410
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
it that's probably the most efficient to
 

411
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,100
it that's probably the most efficient to
do it at y12 and i think i'm gonna do it

412
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,110
do it at y12 and i think i'm gonna do it
 

413
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,200
do it at y12 and i think i'm gonna do it
at at y5 is where you reach bedrock so I

414
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,210
at at y5 is where you reach bedrock so I
 

415
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,720
at at y5 is where you reach bedrock so I
think maybe y6 would give you a good

416
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:54,730
think maybe y6 would give you a good
 

417
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,340
think maybe y6 would give you a good
coverage that leaves two or three blocks

418
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,350
coverage that leaves two or three blocks
 

419
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,720
coverage that leaves two or three blocks
I think it's wait a minute okay so this

420
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:03,730
I think it's wait a minute okay so this
 

421
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,270
I think it's wait a minute okay so this
is why twelve one two three four five

422
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,280
is why twelve one two three four five
 

423
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,380
is why twelve one two three four five
yeah I think that's good there'll be

424
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,390
yeah I think that's good there'll be
 

425
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,780
yeah I think that's good there'll be
like two or three blocks between the two

426
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:12,790
like two or three blocks between the two
 

427
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,630
like two or three blocks between the two
layers that way and since the ores they

428
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:15,640
layers that way and since the ores they
 

429
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,370
layers that way and since the ores they
they form in a clump you're most likely

430
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:17,380
they form in a clump you're most likely
 

431
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,440
they form in a clump you're most likely
Anna's gonna see anything that forms

432
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,450
Anna's gonna see anything that forms
 

433
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,060
Anna's gonna see anything that forms
between the two layers as well and

434
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,070
between the two layers as well and
 

435
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,970
between the two layers as well and
diamonds go down or start it I think why

436
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:23,980
diamonds go down or start it I think why
 

437
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,020
diamonds go down or start it I think why
16 so just like a couple blocks above

438
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,030
16 so just like a couple blocks above
 

439
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,410
16 so just like a couple blocks above
where we're at here so most likely we're

440
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:31,420
where we're at here so most likely we're
 

441
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,810
where we're at here so most likely we're
gonna see just about every single or

442
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:34,820
gonna see just about every single or
 

443
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,960
gonna see just about every single or
like picking out these blocks and bring

444
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:37,970
like picking out these blocks and bring
 

445
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,460
like picking out these blocks and bring
the shovel with you because there's tons

446
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,470
the shovel with you because there's tons
 

447
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,620
the shovel with you because there's tons
of drips and gravel along there

448
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,630
of drips and gravel along there
 

449
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:51,850
of drips and gravel along there
oh yeah so check it out this is like

450
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:51,860
oh yeah so check it out this is like
 

451
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,920
oh yeah so check it out this is like
this is maybe ten minutes later so I've

452
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:53,930
this is maybe ten minutes later so I've
 

453
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,350
this is maybe ten minutes later so I've
been doing a bit of mining I used up the

454
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,360
been doing a bit of mining I used up the
 

455
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,780
been doing a bit of mining I used up the
durability on one of the pics and I just

456
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:58,790
durability on one of the pics and I just
 

457
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,370
durability on one of the pics and I just
wanted to show you how much space you

458
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:00,380
wanted to show you how much space you
 

459
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,500
wanted to show you how much space you
can clear out with one and I've been

460
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,510
can clear out with one and I've been
 

461
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,509
can clear out with one and I've been
trying my best not to mine any of the

462
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:04,519
trying my best not to mine any of the
 

463
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,490
trying my best not to mine any of the
ores I saw just so yeah idea of how that

464
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:06,500
ores I saw just so yeah idea of how that
 

465
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,210
ores I saw just so yeah idea of how that
words are spaced out too and yeah lots

466
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,220
words are spaced out too and yeah lots
 

467
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,040
words are spaced out too and yeah lots
of redstone oh baby so I think my

468
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,050
of redstone oh baby so I think my
 

469
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,620
of redstone oh baby so I think my
redstone crisis has been solved and yeah

470
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,630
redstone crisis has been solved and yeah
 

471
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,449
redstone crisis has been solved and yeah
this can be grindy - don't get me wrong

472
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:22,459
this can be grindy - don't get me wrong
 

473
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,610
this can be grindy - don't get me wrong
but it's personally I find it enjoyable

474

relaxing branch mining is - I guess in a

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,310
relaxing branch mining is - I guess in a
 

489
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,240
relaxing branch mining is - I guess in a
way so I don't know whatever floats your

490
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,250
way so I don't know whatever floats your
 

491
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,000
way so I don't know whatever floats your
boat I guess but this this is the way

492
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,010
boat I guess but this this is the way
 

493
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,150
boat I guess but this this is the way
I'm gonna be doing it and not only that

494
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,160
I'm gonna be doing it and not only that
 

495
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,340
I'm gonna be doing it and not only that
there's also a downstairs I started a

496
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,350
there's also a downstairs I started a
 

497
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,500
there's also a downstairs I started a
lower level just to try it out and it's

498
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,510
lower level just to try it out and it's
 

499
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,650
lower level just to try it out and it's
pretty good it's not not quite as

500
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:05,660
pretty good it's not not quite as
 

501
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,180
pretty good it's not not quite as
efficient on the lower level I think

502
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,190
efficient on the lower level I think
 

503
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,060
efficient on the lower level I think
there's less diamonds and also you have

504
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,070
there's less diamonds and also you have
 

505
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,639
there's less diamonds and also you have
to deal with the lava a little bit more

506
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:11,649
to deal with the lava a little bit more
 

507
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,050
to deal with the lava a little bit more
this is a good example though like if

508
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,060
this is a good example though like if
 

509
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,380
this is a good example though like if
you if you see couldn't you weren't able

510
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,390
you if you see couldn't you weren't able
 

511
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,060
you if you see couldn't you weren't able
to see these diamonds from the top layer

512
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,070
to see these diamonds from the top layer
 

513
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,800
to see these diamonds from the top layer
but you can see it from that the bottom

514
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810
but you can see it from that the bottom
 

515
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,780
but you can see it from that the bottom
layer here oh yeah and you get tons of

516
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:28,790
layer here oh yeah and you get tons of
 

517
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,269
layer here oh yeah and you get tons of
XP from diamonds

518
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:30,279
XP from diamonds
 

519
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:37,769
XP from diamonds
that's about all they're good for yeah

520
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:37,779

 

521
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:42,360

525
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,509

eighteen levels so it's gonna cost 33 to

526
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:48,519
eighteen levels so it's gonna cost 33 to
 

527
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,449
eighteen levels so it's gonna cost 33 to
repair the pic if you want to while

528
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:51,459
repair the pic if you want to while
 

529
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,309
repair the pic if you want to while
you're doing this if you don't have a

530
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:53,319
you're doing this if you don't have a
 

531
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,650
you're doing this if you don't have a
good XP farm and XP is actually really

532
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:55,660
good XP farm and XP is actually really
 

533
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,530
good XP farm and XP is actually really
important to you you can like clean up

534
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:58,540
important to you you can like clean up
 

535
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,840
important to you you can like clean up
this lava as you go bring some iron

536
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:00,850
this lava as you go bring some iron
 

537
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,929
this lava as you go bring some iron
budgets with you and pick it up and use

538
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:03,939
budgets with you and pick it up and use
 

539
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:05,670
budgets with you and pick it up and use
it to smelt all the cobblestone you get

540
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
it to smelt all the cobblestone you get
 

541
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,889
it to smelt all the cobblestone you get
if you want and you'll get XP from that

542
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:07,899
if you want and you'll get XP from that
 

543
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,429
if you want and you'll get XP from that
too

544
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:08,439
too
 

545
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,699
too
I don't think I'm gonna be doing that

546
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:11,709
I don't think I'm gonna be doing that
 

547
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,170
I don't think I'm gonna be doing that
maybe I might set up an auto smelter

548
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,180
maybe I might set up an auto smelter
 

549
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,749
maybe I might set up an auto smelter
just to get the stone I don't I don't

550
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:15,759
just to get the stone I don't I don't
 

551
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,759
just to get the stone I don't I don't
think I'd really bother for it or bother

552
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:17,769
think I'd really bother for it or bother
 

553
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,439
think I'd really bother for it or bother
with it for the XP because I have an

554
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:19,449
with it for the XP because I have an
 

555
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,749
with it for the XP because I have an
Enderman farm but that's another way you

556
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:21,759
Enderman farm but that's another way you
 

557
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,689
Enderman farm but that's another way you
can get XP 2 and you get XP from

558
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:24,699
can get XP 2 and you get XP from
 

559
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,610
can get XP 2 and you get XP from
smelting the iron and the gold and

560
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:26,620
smelting the iron and the gold and
 

561
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,369
smelting the iron and the gold and
whatnot so well it works out pretty good

562
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:29,379
whatnot so well it works out pretty good
 

563
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,280
whatnot so well it works out pretty good
and it only costs 3 diamonds to repair

564
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,290
and it only costs 3 diamonds to repair
 

565
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,590
and it only costs 3 diamonds to repair
the pick which we've definitely turned

566
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,600
the pick which we've definitely turned
 

567
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,929
the pick which we've definitely turned
up in this in this excavation and if you

568
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:39,939
up in this in this excavation and if you
 

569
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,790
up in this in this excavation and if you
do this and you're going to go repair

570
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:41,800
do this and you're going to go repair
 

571
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,999
do this and you're going to go repair
your work pick make sure you don't like

572
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:45,009
your work pick make sure you don't like
 

573
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,869

if you do it this way

574
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:45,879
if you do it this way
 

575
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,579
if you do it this way
it's 33 levels if you do it this way oh

576
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:49,589
it's 33 levels if you do it this way oh
 

577
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,980
it's 33 levels if you do it this way oh
it's only 27 but you don't get to keep

578
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:52,990
it's only 27 but you don't get to keep
 

579
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,300
it's only 27 but you don't get to keep
the name on the pick so you lose the

580
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,310
the name on the pick so you lose the
 

581
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,280
the name on the pick so you lose the
name which means you won't be able to

582
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,290
name which means you won't be able to
 

583
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,470
name which means you won't be able to
repair it in the future or at least not

584
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
repair it in the future or at least not
 

585
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,670
repair it in the future or at least not
for cheap so do it that way but anyway I

586
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
for cheap so do it that way but anyway I
 

587
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,559
for cheap so do it that way but anyway I
guess that's enough mining for today I

588
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:07,569
guess that's enough mining for today I
 

589
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,079
guess that's enough mining for today I
used up the durability on another pick

590
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,089
used up the durability on another pick
 

591
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,360
used up the durability on another pick
so I did double what I did before and we

592
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,370
so I did double what I did before and we
 

593
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,540
so I did double what I did before and we
got that's we got that going that and

594
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:15,550
got that's we got that going that and
 

595
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,629
got that's we got that going that and
that for the iron and gold you get a lot

596
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
that for the iron and gold you get a lot
 

597
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,540
that for the iron and gold you get a lot
of gold from it it's it's pretty pretty

598
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:21,550
of gold from it it's it's pretty pretty
 

599
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,129
of gold from it it's it's pretty pretty
good way of getting gold especially but

600
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:26,139
good way of getting gold especially but
 

601
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,860
good way of getting gold especially but
yeah and check this out I have not seen

602
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:28,870
yeah and check this out I have not seen
 

603
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,509
yeah and check this out I have not seen
this much redstone in my world I think

604
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:30,519
this much redstone in my world I think
 

605
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,139
this much redstone in my world I think
ever four four stacks of blocks plus we

606
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:34,149
ever four four stacks of blocks plus we
 

607
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,759
ever four four stacks of blocks plus we
got that we got a good amount of

608
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:35,769
got that we got a good amount of
 

609
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,780
got that we got a good amount of
repeaters and comparators so Wilson Oh

610
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:38,790
repeaters and comparators so Wilson Oh
 

611
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,549
repeaters and comparators so Wilson Oh
Wilson I might just finish your brain

612
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:41,559
Wilson I might just finish your brain
 

613
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,179
Wilson I might just finish your brain
after all I haven't haven't messed with

614
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:45,189
after all I haven't haven't messed with
 

615
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,249

them in a long time but I've I've had
 

617
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,730
them in a long time but I've I've had
that urge again he's still he's still

618
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:50,740
that urge again he's still he's still
 

619

that project it's good

622
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
that project it's good
 

623
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,180
that project it's good
be awesome if I ever finish it but it is

624
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,190
be awesome if I ever finish it but it is
 

625
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,930
be awesome if I ever finish it but it is
really complicated and I keep changing

626
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:03,940
really complicated and I keep changing
 

627
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,990
really complicated and I keep changing
my mind with what I want to do with it I

628
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
my mind with what I want to do with it I
 

629
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,170
my mind with what I want to do with it I

anymore but I talked to a youtuber about
lucid dreams he kind of brought up the

1030
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,240
lucid dreams he kind of brought up the
 

1031
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,030
lucid dreams he kind of brought up the
subject because it was something he did

1032
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,040
subject because it was something he did
 

1033
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,110
subject because it was something he did
before and he was telling me the process

1034
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
before and he was telling me the process
 

1035
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,180
before and he was telling me the process
involved with how it works and all that

1036
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,190
involved with how it works and all that
 

1037
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,680
involved with how it works and all that
and he said never never do it because he

1038
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:37,690
and he said never never do it because he
 

1039
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,990
and he said never never do it because he
kind of went crazy from it because he

1040
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
kind of went crazy from it because he
 

1041
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,909
kind of went crazy from it because he
had ideas that I sort of tricked your

1042
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
had ideas that I sort of tricked your
 

1043
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,140
had ideas that I sort of tricked your
mind into

1044
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,150

 

1045
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,460

you have to do these things to your mind

1046
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:49,470
you have to do these things to your mind
 

1047
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,980
you have to do these things to your mind
and basically it worked out where he

1048
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:51,990
and basically it worked out where he
 

1049
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,480
and basically it worked out where he
couldn't tell if he was dreaming or not

1050
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,490
couldn't tell if he was dreaming or not
 

1051
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,310
couldn't tell if he was dreaming or not
if like you couldn't distinguish between

1052
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,320
if like you couldn't distinguish between
 

1053
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,670
if like you couldn't distinguish between
the real world and a lucid dream so he

1054
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:58,680
the real world and a lucid dream so he
 

1055
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,320
the real world and a lucid dream so he
was starting to go crazy from it so be

1056
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,330
was starting to go crazy from it so be
 

1057
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,000
was starting to go crazy from it so be
careful if you if you get into that

1058
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,010
careful if you if you get into that
 

1059
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,740
careful if you if you get into that
stuff and I'm wondering have you ever

1060
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:09,750
stuff and I'm wondering have you ever
 

1061
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,180
stuff and I'm wondering have you ever
known that there's a dream if not what's
