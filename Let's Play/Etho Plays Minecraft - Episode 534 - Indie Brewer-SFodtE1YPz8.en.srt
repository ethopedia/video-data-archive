episode today and to begin with here
we're just gonna check out something I

10
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,100
we're just gonna check out something I
 

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,980
we're just gonna check out something I
saw in the comments on last one someone

12
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:18,990
saw in the comments on last one someone
 

13
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,179
saw in the comments on last one someone
corrected me that I said that the

14
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:23,189
corrected me that I said that the
 

15
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,019
corrected me that I said that the
beehives

16
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:24,029
beehives
 

17
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,910
beehives
you can't generate them by growing

18
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
you can't generate them by growing
 

19
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,060
you can't generate them by growing
saplings you have to go to new chunks to

20
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,070
saplings you have to go to new chunks to
 

21
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,859
saplings you have to go to new chunks to
find them and someone was like no no no

22
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:30,869
find them and someone was like no no no
 

23
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,389
find them and someone was like no no no
you though you can just grow the trees

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
you though you can just grow the trees
 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,560
you though you can just grow the trees
you just have to make sure you're in a

26
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,570
you just have to make sure you're in a
 

27
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,690
you just have to make sure you're in a
Plains biome or sunflower Plains or

28
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,700
Plains biome or sunflower Plains or
 

29
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,760
Plains biome or sunflower Plains or
flower force you have you still have a

30
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:37,770
flower force you have you still have a
 

31
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,889
flower force you have you still have a
5% chance so we're just gonna test that

32
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:39,899
5% chance so we're just gonna test that
 

33
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,880
5% chance so we're just gonna test that
out here to begin with

34
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:40,890
out here to begin with
 

35
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,310
out here to begin with
I've set up a bunch of trees here so it

36
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
I've set up a bunch of trees here so it
 

37
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,500
I've set up a bunch of trees here so it
should be a one in 20 chance we'll get a

38
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,510
should be a one in 20 chance we'll get a
 

39
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,900
should be a one in 20 chance we'll get a
beehive on one of these if it works the

40
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:47,910
beehive on one of these if it works the
 

41
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,560
beehive on one of these if it works the
wiki page says it doesn't work but I

42
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:51,570
wiki page says it doesn't work but I
 

43
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,290
wiki page says it doesn't work but I
didn't I didn't properly test it so just

44
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,300
didn't I didn't properly test it so just
 

45
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,459
didn't I didn't properly test it so just
want to double-check you know see which

46
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:58,469
want to double-check you know see which
 

47
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,619
want to double-check you know see which
is right the wiki page says you have to

48
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:00,629
is right the wiki page says you have to
 

49
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,810
is right the wiki page says you have to
generate new chunks to get them so

50
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:02,820
generate new chunks to get them so
 

51
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,590
generate new chunks to get them so
that's what I assumed was correct

52
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
that's what I assumed was correct
 

53
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,880
that's what I assumed was correct
hey I kind of hate doing this because I

54
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:07,890
hey I kind of hate doing this because I
 

55
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,109
hey I kind of hate doing this because I
have to chop down every single one of

56
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
have to chop down every single one of
 

57
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,100
have to chop down every single one of
these trees after I haven't seen one yet

58
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,110
these trees after I haven't seen one yet
 

59
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,660
these trees after I haven't seen one yet
alright I got a couple extra here just

60
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,670
alright I got a couple extra here just
 

61
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,780
alright I got a couple extra here just
to try a few more I'll do a few more

62
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:20,790
to try a few more I'll do a few more
 

63
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,450
to try a few more I'll do a few more
off-camera just the candy kind of make

64
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,460
off-camera just the candy kind of make
 

65
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,690
off-camera just the candy kind of make
sure cuz it's a one in 20 chance but you

66
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,700
sure cuz it's a one in 20 chance but you
 

67
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,100
sure cuz it's a one in 20 chance but you
only grow thirty trees there's a chance

68
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,110
only grow thirty trees there's a chance
 

69
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,460
only grow thirty trees there's a chance
you know you might not get it still okay

70
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,470
you know you might not get it still okay
 

71
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,980
you know you might not get it still okay
so I grew eighty oak saplings in the

72
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:33,990
so I grew eighty oak saplings in the
 

73
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,050
so I grew eighty oak saplings in the
planes biome here and not one of them

74
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,060
planes biome here and not one of them
 

75
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,749
planes biome here and not one of them
spawned a beehive when it grew so I'm

76
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
spawned a beehive when it grew so I'm
 

77
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,090
spawned a beehive when it grew so I'm
gonna call that busted I do feel like

78
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,100
gonna call that busted I do feel like
 

79
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
gonna call that busted I do feel like
that's a great idea though to be honest

80
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:42,810
that's a great idea though to be honest
 

81
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,660
that's a great idea though to be honest
like maybe in Flour forests if you grow

82
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:44,670
like maybe in Flour forests if you grow
 

83
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,120
like maybe in Flour forests if you grow
a tree you have a 5% chance of spawning

84
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,130
a tree you have a 5% chance of spawning
 

85
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,889
a tree you have a 5% chance of spawning
in a bee hive that way they would be

86
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:48,899
in a bee hive that way they would be
 

87
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,530
in a bee hive that way they would be
farmable in some way and like if you

88
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,540
farmable in some way and like if you
 

89
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,300
farmable in some way and like if you
didn't want to go exploring to get them

90
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,310
didn't want to go exploring to get them
 

91
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,609
didn't want to go exploring to get them
or if you couldn't you would have an

92
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
or if you couldn't you would have an
 

93
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,950
or if you couldn't you would have an
option like another way of doing it

94
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
option like another way of doing it
 

95
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,450
option like another way of doing it
right like in my world I would have

96
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,460
right like in my world I would have
 

97
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,010
right like in my world I would have
preferred to just generate it I didn't

98
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
preferred to just generate it I didn't
 

99
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,700
preferred to just generate it I didn't
want to go exploring for it but I had to

100
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:03,710
want to go exploring for it but I had to
 

101
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,990
want to go exploring for it but I had to
because it's an older world and I don't

102
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
because it's an older world and I don't
 

103
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,270
because it's an older world and I don't
want my world size to get bigger or

104
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
want my world size to get bigger or
 

105
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,660
want my world size to get bigger or
stuff like that right yeah so I think

106
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:11,670
stuff like that right yeah so I think
 

107
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,619
stuff like that right yeah so I think
that would be cool but I don't think

108
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:12,629
that would be cool but I don't think
 

109
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,280
that would be cool but I don't think
they should do it for

110
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,290
they should do it for
 

111
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,259
they should do it for
every biome because then you run into

112
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:15,269
every biome because then you run into
 

113
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,910
every biome because then you run into
issues where like maybe it'll break some

114
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:16,920
issues where like maybe it'll break some
 

115
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,470
issues where like maybe it'll break some
tree farm designs and stuff I don't

116
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
tree farm designs and stuff I don't
 

117
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,729
tree farm designs and stuff I don't
think that'd be good so maybe just pick

118
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:19,739
think that'd be good so maybe just pick
 

119
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,089
think that'd be good so maybe just pick
a biome where that happens it would be

120
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:23,099
a biome where that happens it would be
 

121
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,880
a biome where that happens it would be
best in my opinion add a little bit more

122
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:25,890
best in my opinion add a little bit more
 

123
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,849
best in my opinion add a little bit more
interest to the game that way too but

124
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:28,859
interest to the game that way too but
 

125
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,809
interest to the game that way too but
anyways something we got to do here I

126
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:31,819
anyways something we got to do here I
 

127
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,809
anyways something we got to do here I
actually need carrots so this is my old

128
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
actually need carrots so this is my old
 

129
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,789
actually need carrots so this is my old
mini farm design I've built like four or

130
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:37,799
mini farm design I've built like four or
 

131
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,110
mini farm design I've built like four or
five different mini farms in my world

132
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
five different mini farms in my world
 

133
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,970
five different mini farms in my world
and most of them are broken or they keep

134
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:40,980
and most of them are broken or they keep
 

135
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,860
and most of them are broken or they keep
breaking all right this doesn't work

136
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:42,870
breaking all right this doesn't work
 

137
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,860
breaking all right this doesn't work
anymore because it requires darkness to

138
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:47,870
anymore because it requires darkness to
 

139
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,569
anymore because it requires darkness to
cause the crop to pop off and now half

140
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:50,579
cause the crop to pop off and now half
 

141
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,470
cause the crop to pop off and now half
slabs let light through them right so

142
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,480
slabs let light through them right so
 

143
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,119
slabs let light through them right so
that doesn't work you need a full block

144
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:56,129
that doesn't work you need a full block
 

145
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,619
that doesn't work you need a full block
to block of all the light so now when it

146
00:02:59,619 --> 00:02:59,629
to block of all the light so now when it
 

147
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,159
to block of all the light so now when it
would do that it would be done right so

148
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,169
would do that it would be done right so
 

149
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,149
would do that it would be done right so
I has this mess around with another

150
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
I has this mess around with another
 

151
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,190
I has this mess around with another
design here because we need carrots for

152
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
design here because we need carrots for
 

153
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,960
design here because we need carrots for
a project today very simple just like

154
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:11,970
a project today very simple just like
 

155
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,759
a project today very simple just like
this right we're gonna load this up with

156
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:13,769
this right we're gonna load this up with
 

157
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,970
this right we're gonna load this up with
bone meal okay so we got these loaded up

158
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
bone meal okay so we got these loaded up
 

159
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,030
bone meal okay so we got these loaded up

00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:41,579
mention is to automatically pick up the

mention is to automatically pick up the
crops you want to put a hopper

180
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:43,109
crops you want to put a hopper
 

181
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,020
crops you want to put a hopper
underneath the farmland so that'll pick

182
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,030
underneath the farmland so that'll pick
 

183
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,430
underneath the farmland so that'll pick
it up through the farmland block

184
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,440
it up through the farmland block
 

185
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,319
it up through the farmland block
actually and we'll put it into the chest

186
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,329
actually and we'll put it into the chest
 

187
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,689
actually and we'll put it into the chest
here what I like to do is put a slab

00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:50,699
here what I like to do is put a slab
 

189
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,000
here what I like to do is put a slab
here as well so most of crop for most

190
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,010
here as well so most of crop for most
 

191
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,719

the plants don't land where I'm standing
 

193
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,670
the plants don't land where I'm standing
the land on the farm line a few will

194
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
the land on the farm line a few will
 

195
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,050
the land on the farm line a few will
land where I'm standing and I can pick

196
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
land where I'm standing and I can pick
 

197
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,409

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:03,419
those up to keep my inventory full but
 

199
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,210
those up to keep my inventory full but
like not enough that those start be

00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,220
like not enough that those start be

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
oh I'm missing something
 

209
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,069
oh I'm missing something
I think I ran this up to the piston like

210
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,079
I think I ran this up to the piston like
 

211
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,830
I think I ran this up to the piston like
that hmm okay I just double-checked my

212
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
that hmm okay I just double-checked my
 

213
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,420
that hmm okay I just double-checked my
creative world like where I built this

214
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,430
creative world like where I built this
 

215
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,300
creative world like where I built this
originally and didn't do it like that

216
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,310
originally and didn't do it like that
 

217
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,570
originally and didn't do it like that
as it is right now it's pretty bad it

218
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,580
as it is right now it's pretty bad it
 

219
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,830
as it is right now it's pretty bad it
like breaks every second one or so and

220
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
like breaks every second one or so and
 

221
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,300
like breaks every second one or so and
it wasn't doing that in the creative

222
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,310
it wasn't doing that in the creative
 

223
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,310
it wasn't doing that in the creative
world but I also put this differently

224
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,320
world but I also put this differently
 

225
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,030
world but I also put this differently
when I built in the creative world was

226
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
when I built in the creative world was
 

227
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,370
when I built in the creative world was
the piston on this side so these this

228
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,380
the piston on this side so these this
 

229
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,130
the piston on this side so these this
redstone here activates it I don't know

230
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,140
redstone here activates it I don't know
 

231
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,180
redstone here activates it I don't know
if that would make much of a difference

232
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,190
if that would make much of a difference
 

233
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,380
if that would make much of a difference
so I guess let's figure it out

234
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,390
so I guess let's figure it out
 

235
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,880
so I guess let's figure it out
it still glitches out so something I

236
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:55,890
it still glitches out so something I
 

237
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,440
it still glitches out so something I
think cuz my world laggy it doesn't work

238
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,450
think cuz my world laggy it doesn't work
 

239
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,140
think cuz my world laggy it doesn't work
as well maybe yeah so the layout is

240
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,150
as well maybe yeah so the layout is
 

241
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,210
as well maybe yeah so the layout is
exactly the same I'm pretty sure but I'm

242
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,220
exactly the same I'm pretty sure but I'm
 

243
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,500
exactly the same I'm pretty sure but I'm
going to show you the creative world

244
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,510
going to show you the creative world
 

245
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,790
going to show you the creative world
version here just to show you I'm not

246
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
version here just to show you I'm not
 

247
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,500
version here just to show you I'm not
crazy see it works so I think by a let's

248
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,510
crazy see it works so I think by a let's
 

249
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,510
crazy see it works so I think by a let's
play world's just kinda laggy and it

250
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
play world's just kinda laggy and it
 

251
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,680
play world's just kinda laggy and it
doesn't work as well so maybe I need to

252
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:15,690
doesn't work as well so maybe I need to
 

253
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,320
doesn't work as well so maybe I need to
try to fix it okay so I decide to come

254
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,330
try to fix it okay so I decide to come
 

255
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,120
try to fix it okay so I decide to come
up with another design here cuz that

256
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,130
up with another design here cuz that
 

257
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,520
up with another design here cuz that
light-based one was giving me a bit of

258
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,530
light-based one was giving me a bit of
 

259
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,780
light-based one was giving me a bit of
trouble actually sometimes it would work

260
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:23,790
trouble actually sometimes it would work
 

261
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,210
trouble actually sometimes it would work
and sometimes it wouldn't I think it

262
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
and sometimes it wouldn't I think it
 

263
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,860
and sometimes it wouldn't I think it
works always if you build it underground

264
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:27,870
works always if you build it underground
 

265
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,719
works always if you build it underground
but if it's above ground it can be a

266
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:29,729
but if it's above ground it can be a
 

267
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,719
but if it's above ground it can be a
little bit tricky so I came up with

268
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:32,729
little bit tricky so I came up with
 

269
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:33,830
little bit tricky so I came up with
something a little weird here I'm just

270
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
something a little weird here I'm just
 

271
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,460
something a little weird here I'm just
gonna run some hoppers to a chest the

272
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,470
gonna run some hoppers to a chest the
 

273
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,719
gonna run some hoppers to a chest the
idea with this one is we're gonna have

274
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:38,729
idea with this one is we're gonna have
 

275
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,200
idea with this one is we're gonna have
some sticky pistons one over here one

276
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,210
some sticky pistons one over here one
 

277
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,390
some sticky pistons one over here one
over here to bounce the farmland back

278
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
over here to bounce the farmland back
 

279
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,030
over here to bounce the farmland back
and forth that's gonna be our farmland

280
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,040
and forth that's gonna be our farmland
 

281
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,330
and forth that's gonna be our farmland
block and yes we can cover that and that

282
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,340
block and yes we can cover that and that
 

283
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,050
block and yes we can cover that and that
then we run some blocks over here break

284
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,060
then we run some blocks over here break
 

285
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,820
then we run some blocks over here break
this redstone torch here and repeater

286
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,830
this redstone torch here and repeater
 

287
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,380
this redstone torch here and repeater
set at two so the idea is Pistons like

288
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:09,390
set at two so the idea is Pistons like
 

289
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,450
set at two so the idea is Pistons like
instantly retract but it takes two ticks

290
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:11,460
instantly retract but it takes two ticks
 

291
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,969
instantly retract but it takes two ticks
to extend so we want this to retract as

292
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:13,979
to extend so we want this to retract as
 

293
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,190
to extend so we want this to retract as
soon as possible like one once we grow

294
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,200
soon as possible like one once we grow
 

295
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,830
soon as possible like one once we grow
the crop on it we want it to move as

296
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
the crop on it we want it to move as
 

297
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,500
the crop on it we want it to move as
soon as possible so on the retraction

298
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,510
soon as possible so on the retraction
 

299
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,240
soon as possible so on the retraction
it's like instant

300
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,250

 

301
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,820

yeah and then that other piston-like

302
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:27,830
yeah and then that other piston-like
 

303
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,970
yeah and then that other piston-like
brings it back as soon as it can too so

304
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:29,980
brings it back as soon as it can too so
 

305
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,150
brings it back as soon as it can too so
it's like a double tree track so it pops

306
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
it's like a double tree track so it pops
 

307
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,460
it's like a double tree track so it pops
up popped off the crop doesn't rely on a

308
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,470
up popped off the crop doesn't rely on a
 

309
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,820
up popped off the crop doesn't rely on a
light hoppers pick up the crop

310
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:39,830
light hoppers pick up the crop
 

311
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,650
light hoppers pick up the crop
underneath put it in the chest we got

312
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:41,660
underneath put it in the chest we got
 

313
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,310
underneath put it in the chest we got
double hoppers and it should be good I

314
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,320
double hoppers and it should be good I
 

315
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,170
double hoppers and it should be good I
think so then we can like build it up

316
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,180
think so then we can like build it up
 

317
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,260
think so then we can like build it up
however we want here it's a little slow

simple very easy to do so the way we
 

343
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,350
simple very easy to do so the way we
used to do this the way we would fill it

344
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
used to do this the way we would fill it
 

345

up
 

347
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
up
we would fill up our inventory with

348
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:31,790
we would fill up our inventory with
 

349
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,670
we would fill up our inventory with
something right and then we would just

350
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
something right and then we would just
 

351
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,000
something right and then we would just
go on the water shift right click and

352
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,010
go on the water shift right click and
 

353
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,159
go on the water shift right click and
the bottles would pop out of our

354
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,169
the bottles would pop out of our
 

355
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,500
the bottles would pop out of our
inventory landed in the hopper here but

356
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,510
inventory landed in the hopper here but
 

357
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,469
inventory landed in the hopper here but
now in Minecraft 1.15 they added a cool

358
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
now in Minecraft 1.15 they added a cool
 

359
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,960
now in Minecraft 1.15 they added a cool
little feature here if we put water in

360
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,970
little feature here if we put water in
 

361
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,510
little feature here if we put water in
front of a dispenser so we're gonna

362
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
front of a dispenser so we're gonna
 

363
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
front of a dispenser so we're gonna
we're gonna do that water right in front

364
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:50,930
we're gonna do that water right in front
 

365
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,210
we're gonna do that water right in front
of this dispenser or hopper underneath

366
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,220
of this dispenser or hopper underneath
 

367
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,790
of this dispenser or hopper underneath
if we put empty bottles in that

368
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
if we put empty bottles in that
 

369
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
if we put empty bottles in that
dispenser it will be able to

370
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,450
dispenser it will be able to
 

371
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,050
dispenser it will be able to
automatically fill them with water so

372
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,060
automatically fill them with water so
 

373
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,270
automatically fill them with water so
that's pretty cool pretty cool so what

374
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
that's pretty cool pretty cool so what
 

375
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
that's pretty cool pretty cool so what
we got to do is check if there is any

376
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,450
we got to do is check if there is any
 

377
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,870
we got to do is check if there is any
bottles in here and we do that with the

378
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:04,880
bottles in here and we do that with the
 

379
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,140
bottles in here and we do that with the
comparator right and then we run that

380
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,150
comparator right and then we run that
 

381
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,900
comparator right and then we run that
into a redstone torch over here back up

382
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:10,910
into a redstone torch over here back up
 

383
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,450
into a redstone torch over here back up
to the dispenser and then we just got to

384
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:13,460
to the dispenser and then we just got to
 

385
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,969
to the dispenser and then we just got to
fill this up with bottles if there's an

386
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:15,979
fill this up with bottles if there's an
 

387
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,100
fill this up with bottles if there's an
empty space the water bottle will go in

388
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,110
empty space the water bottle will go in
 

389
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,469
empty space the water bottle will go in
the dispenser but if it's full we got to

390
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
the dispenser but if it's full we got to
 

391
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,600
the dispenser but if it's full we got to
keep this thing full that way it'll

392
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,610
keep this thing full that way it'll
 

393
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,610
keep this thing full that way it'll
shoot out the water bottle into the

394
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:24,620
shoot out the water bottle into the
 

395
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,670
shoot out the water bottle into the
hopper here and then all we gonna do is

396
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
hopper here and then all we gonna do is
 

397
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,399
hopper here and then all we gonna do is
tick start this to get it going

398
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:31,409

 

399
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:36,089

yeah so it's gonna keep going until it

400
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,099
yeah so it's gonna keep going until it
 

401
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,649
yeah so it's gonna keep going until it
this is totally filled up and there's

402
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:37,659
this is totally filled up and there's
 

403
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,899
this is totally filled up and there's
like one left in here right and then if

404
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:39,909
like one left in here right and then if
 

405
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,779
like one left in here right and then if
that ever disappears it'll do another

406
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:42,789
that ever disappears it'll do another
 

407
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,030
that ever disappears it'll do another
one and another one and another one so

408
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
one and another one and another one so
 

409
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,500
one and another one and another one so
it'll always keep this full of bottles

410
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:46,510
it'll always keep this full of bottles
 

411
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,720
it'll always keep this full of bottles
which is really cool as long as we got

412
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,730
which is really cool as long as we got
 

413
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,540
which is really cool as long as we got
empty ones above here so it's probably

414
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,550
empty ones above here so it's probably
 

415
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,310
empty ones above here so it's probably
good to run like a hopper and a chest

416
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,320
good to run like a hopper and a chest
 

417
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,240
good to run like a hopper and a chest

I figured out a while ago that I used in

514
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
I figured out a while ago that I used in
 

515
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,410
I figured out a while ago that I used in
my other systems and it's set up in such

516
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:52,420
my other systems and it's set up in such
 

517
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,059
my other systems and it's set up in such
a way like it's gonna keep going and

518
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:54,069
a way like it's gonna keep going and
 

519
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,040
a way like it's gonna keep going and
keep going until it either runs out of

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,050
keep going until it either runs out of
 

521
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,679
keep going until it either runs out of
empty bottles or it runs out of space

for the night vision potions to go or if

524
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:02,529
for the night vision potions to go or if

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:07,149
it runs out of blaze powder yep this
 

527
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:10,499
it runs out of blaze powder yep this
runs out it'll shut off or it also has

528
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:10,509
runs out it'll shut off or it also has
 

529
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,049
runs out it'll shut off or it also has
like a manual shutoff if we flip that

530
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:13,059
like a manual shutoff if we flip that
 

531
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,960
like a manual shutoff if we flip that
down it'll stop running at whatever

532
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:15,970
down it'll stop running at whatever
 

533
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,139
down it'll stop running at whatever
stage it lasts left off at so now it'll

534
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:19,149
stage it lasts left off at so now it'll
 

535
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:26,189
stage it lasts left off at so now it'll
shut off as soon as we undertake sit

536
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:26,199
shut off as soon as we undertake sit
 

537
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,439
shut off as soon as we undertake sit
shut off so that's pretty cool

538
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:28,449
shut off so that's pretty cool
 

539
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,420
shut off so that's pretty cool
so I had a little trouble deciding here

540
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,430
so I had a little trouble deciding here
 

541
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,650
so I had a little trouble deciding here
if I want to make a separate like

542
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:31,660
if I want to make a separate like
 

543
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,989
if I want to make a separate like
tutorial video for this brewing thing or

544
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:33,999
tutorial video for this brewing thing or
 

545
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,189
tutorial video for this brewing thing or
if I should just show it in the let's

546
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:35,199
if I should just show it in the let's
 

547
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,679
if I should just show it in the let's
play series and I think we can build it

548
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:37,689
play series and I think we can build it
 

549
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,210
play series and I think we can build it
pretty quickly so I'm just gonna do it

550
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,220
pretty quickly so I'm just gonna do it
 

551
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,489
pretty quickly so I'm just gonna do it
in the let's play series here a lot

552
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:41,499
in the let's play series here a lot
 

553
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,299
in the let's play series here a lot
easier for me

554
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:42,309
easier for me
 

555
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,069
easier for me
so I would say figure out where you want

556
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
so I would say figure out where you want
 

557
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,139
so I would say figure out where you want
to start with your dispenser first off

558
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:46,149
to start with your dispenser first off
 

559
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,299
to start with your dispenser first off
and you put a block over top and the

560
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:48,309
and you put a block over top and the
 

561
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,559
and you put a block over top and the
pressure plates make sure it's a

562
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:49,569
pressure plates make sure it's a
 

563
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,470
pressure plates make sure it's a
dispenser not a dropper and then we go

564
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
dispenser not a dropper and then we go
 

565
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,679
dispenser not a dropper and then we go
three hoppers into the side let me go to

566
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:55,689
three hoppers into the side let me go to
 

567
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:58,110
three hoppers into the side let me go to
hoppers up and then this is where our

568
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,120
hoppers up and then this is where our
 

569
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,670
hoppers up and then this is where our
brewing stand is gonna go right over

570
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
brewing stand is gonna go right over
 

571
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,780
brewing stand is gonna go right over
here then into that we have one hopper

572
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:03,790
here then into that we have one hopper
 

573
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,900
here then into that we have one hopper
for the water bottles one on the the

574
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:06,910
for the water bottles one on the the
 

575
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,759
for the water bottles one on the the
right side if you're looking this way

576
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:08,769
right side if you're looking this way
 

577
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,670
right side if you're looking this way
for the blaze powder and then on top of

578
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
for the blaze powder and then on top of
 

579
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
for the blaze powder and then on top of
that is our hopper for the ingredients

580
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,170
that is our hopper for the ingredients
 

581
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,980
that is our hopper for the ingredients
and we go up to here it's been a while

582
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:16,990
and we go up to here it's been a while
 

583
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,910
and we go up to here it's been a while
since old tutorial etho came out and

584
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:20,920
since old tutorial etho came out and
 

585
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,610
since old tutorial etho came out and
made it appearance how should we do this

586
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:23,620
made it appearance how should we do this
 

587
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,970
made it appearance how should we do this
that's let's actually just wrap grab

588
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:26,980
that's let's actually just wrap grab
 

589
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,210
that's let's actually just wrap grab
some blocks around this hopper here like

590
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,220
some blocks around this hopper here like
 

591
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,720
some blocks around this hopper here like
that

592
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:30,730
that
 

593
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,519
that
well actually we got a got a punch these

594
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:32,529
well actually we got a got a punch these
 

595
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,799
well actually we got a got a punch these
out then and this is where our droppers

596
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:34,809
out then and this is where our droppers
 

597
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,740
out then and this is where our droppers
are gonna go for our ingredients so we

598
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:37,750
are gonna go for our ingredients so we
 

599
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,030
are gonna go for our ingredients so we
go boop boop boop and boop all facing

600
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,040
go boop boop boop and boop all facing
 

601
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,889
go boop boop boop and boop all facing
into the hopper here it's probably a

602
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:43,899
into the hopper here it's probably a
 

603
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,720
into the hopper here it's probably a
good idea to build our water bottle

604
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,730
good idea to build our water bottle
 

605
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,489
good idea to build our water bottle
filler as soon as possible here so we'll

606
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:47,499
filler as soon as possible here so we'll
 

607
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,739
filler as soon as possible here so we'll
do that next that way we don't like do

608
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:49,749
do that next that way we don't like do
 

609
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,329
do that next that way we don't like do
it later and spill water all over our

610
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:51,339
it later and spill water all over our
 

611
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,090
it later and spill water all over our
redstone so dispenser make sure you use

612
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,100
redstone so dispenser make sure you use
 

613
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,590
redstone so dispenser make sure you use
a dispenser for this and then we're

614
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
a dispenser for this and then we're
 

615
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
a dispenser for this and then we're
gonna close in this area with glass

616
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,490
gonna close in this area with glass
 

617
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,790
gonna close in this area with glass
we don't accidentally break a block and

618
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
we don't accidentally break a block and
 

619
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,870
we don't accidentally break a block and
have it spill everywhere and then we

620
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
have it spill everywhere and then we
 

621
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,070
have it spill everywhere and then we
need to come out like this break those

622
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,080
need to come out like this break those
 

623
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,970
need to come out like this break those
two comparator into this hopper check if

624
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:12,980
two comparator into this hopper check if
 

625
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,380
two comparator into this hopper check if
there's any water bottles in there and

626
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,390
there's any water bottles in there and
 

627
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,630
there's any water bottles in there and
then up to redstone torch like we did

628
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:16,640
then up to redstone torch like we did
 

629
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,300
then up to redstone torch like we did
before and then we can just put a hopper

630
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,310
before and then we can just put a hopper
 

631
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,220
before and then we can just put a hopper
on top of here with some storage for the

632
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,230
on top of here with some storage for the
 

633
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,060
on top of here with some storage for the
glass bottles okay so next up here we're

634
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,070
glass bottles okay so next up here we're
 

635
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,710
glass bottles okay so next up here we're
gonna add our locking line to the thing

636
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
gonna add our locking line to the thing
 

637
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,840
gonna add our locking line to the thing
so any reason to shut down the brewing

638
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:28,850
so any reason to shut down the brewing
 

639
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,010
so any reason to shut down the brewing
this is how we're gonna do it just

640
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,020
this is how we're gonna do it just
 

641
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,079
this is how we're gonna do it just
redstone on top of that hopper there so

642
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,089
redstone on top of that hopper there so
 

643
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,660
redstone on top of that hopper there so
that's our manual shut down that'll lock

644
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:34,670
that's our manual shut down that'll lock
 

645
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,060
that's our manual shut down that'll lock
it we're gonna add a way of locking it

646
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,070
it we're gonna add a way of locking it
 

647
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,240
it we're gonna add a way of locking it
if we run out of the the blaze powder

648
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,250
if we run out of the the blaze powder
 

649
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,790
if we run out of the the blaze powder
and the stopper here so we do that with

650
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
and the stopper here so we do that with
 

651
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,910
and the stopper here so we do that with
a comparator we run that into a block

652
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
a comparator we run that into a block
 

653
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,620
a comparator we run that into a block
and then a redstone torch on the other

654
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,630
and then a redstone torch on the other
 

655
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,230
and then a redstone torch on the other
side and then we're gonna add some

656
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
side and then we're gonna add some
 

657
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,519
side and then we're gonna add some
blocks over here to there and we got a

658
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:54,529
blocks over here to there and we got a
 

659
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,769
blocks over here to there and we got a
check if this gets filled up of night

660
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:56,779
check if this gets filled up of night
 

661
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,210
check if this gets filled up of night
vision potions or whatever we're brewing

662
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,220
vision potions or whatever we're brewing
 

663
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,100
vision potions or whatever we're brewing
we want it to shut down otherwise it's

664
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,110
we want it to shut down otherwise it's
 

665
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,519
we want it to shut down otherwise it's
gonna mess up the brewing process so we

666
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:03,529
gonna mess up the brewing process so we
 

667
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,019
gonna mess up the brewing process so we
checked it with a comparator run that

668
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:05,029
checked it with a comparator run that
 

669
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,410
checked it with a comparator run that
into a repeater we do a staircase up

670
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:08,420
into a repeater we do a staircase up
 

671
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,560
into a repeater we do a staircase up
here that'll run underneath this torch

672
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:11,570
here that'll run underneath this torch
 

673
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,530
here that'll run underneath this torch
which will lock it you'll see this

674
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:14,540
which will lock it you'll see this
 

675
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,269
which will lock it you'll see this
comparator can power the wire through

676
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:16,279
comparator can power the wire through
 

677
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,620
comparator can power the wire through
the block here so we got to put a

678
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:17,630
the block here so we got to put a
 

679
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,630
the block here so we got to put a
repeater here say at 1 and then we run

680
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:22,640
repeater here say at 1 and then we run
 

681
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,430
repeater here say at 1 and then we run
it up to this hopper to the locking area

682
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,440
it up to this hopper to the locking area
 

683
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,590
it up to this hopper to the locking area
so that's good and then we also want to

684
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:26,600
so that's good and then we also want to
 

685
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,150
so that's good and then we also want to
add a way of locking it if we run out of

686
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
add a way of locking it if we run out of
 

687
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,310
add a way of locking it if we run out of
empty bottles like if this hopper is out

688
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
empty bottles like if this hopper is out
 

689
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,740
empty bottles like if this hopper is out
of empty bottles so we'll do that with

690
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:32,750
of empty bottles so we'll do that with
 

691
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,949
of empty bottles so we'll do that with
another comparator over here run that

692
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:35,959
another comparator over here run that
 

693
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,310
another comparator over here run that
into a block and to a redstone torch on

694
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,320
into a block and to a redstone torch on
 

695
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
into a block and to a redstone torch on
this side so that'll power it over here

696
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,410
this side so that'll power it over here
 

697
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,960
this side so that'll power it over here
cool alright so now we're gonna get into

698
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:43,970
cool alright so now we're gonna get into
 

699
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,360
cool alright so now we're gonna get into
the final part of this the controls for

700
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,370
the final part of this the controls for
 

701
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,519
the final part of this the controls for
the brewing so this hopper above the

702
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:48,529
the brewing so this hopper above the
 

703
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,199
the brewing so this hopper above the
brewing stands pretty important we need

704
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:50,209
brewing stands pretty important we need
 

705
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,269
brewing stands pretty important we need
to fill it with some items some junk

706
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:52,279
to fill it with some items some junk
 

707
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,870
to fill it with some items some junk
items like cobblestones fine we're gonna

708
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:55,880
items like cobblestones fine we're gonna
 

709
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,210
items like cobblestones fine we're gonna
want 19 items in that second slot and

710
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,220
want 19 items in that second slot and
 

711
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,850
want 19 items in that second slot and
leave the first one open then we're

712
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:00,860
leave the first one open then we're
 

713
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,130
leave the first one open then we're
gonna set up a block in front of it

714
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,140
gonna set up a block in front of it
 

715
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,290
gonna set up a block in front of it
they're probably the easiest way to

716
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:05,300
they're probably the easiest way to
 

717
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,970
they're probably the easiest way to
place this comparators is mined out

718
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:06,980
place this comparators is mined out
 

719
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,760
place this comparators is mined out
those to place it that way so it's going

720
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:09,770
those to place it that way so it's going
 

721
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,840
those to place it that way so it's going
to detect what's in this hopper

722
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,850
to detect what's in this hopper
 

723
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,080
to detect what's in this hopper
we put those back and then we're gonna

724
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,090
we put those back and then we're gonna
 

725
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,190
we put those back and then we're gonna
go

726
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,200

 

727
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,010

yeah and thinking about is like wait a

728
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,020
yeah and thinking about is like wait a
 

729
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,750
yeah and thinking about is like wait a
second that doesn't seem right I guess

730
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:22,760
second that doesn't seem right I guess
 

731
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,340
second that doesn't seem right I guess
we gotta bust out the corner of this

732
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,350
we gotta bust out the corner of this
 

733
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,850
we gotta bust out the corner of this
brick here and then we run a repeater

734
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:30,860
brick here and then we run a repeater
 

735
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,890
brick here and then we run a repeater
into this block so that locks this

736
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:32,900
into this block so that locks this
 

737
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,440
into this block so that locks this
hopper underneath the brewer and then we

738
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,450
hopper underneath the brewer and then we
 

739
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,140
hopper underneath the brewer and then we
run redstone above here and then this is

740
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,150
run redstone above here and then this is
 

741
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,970
run redstone above here and then this is
very important we need a redstone torch

742
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:42,980
very important we need a redstone torch
 

743
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,950
very important we need a redstone torch
on the other side here which will lock

744
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:44,960
on the other side here which will lock
 

745
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,270
on the other side here which will lock
this hopper and then we go up a block

746
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,280
this hopper and then we go up a block
 

747
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,510
this hopper and then we go up a block
and this is why we carry our ladders and

748
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:55,520
and this is why we carry our ladders and
 

749
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,160
and this is why we carry our ladders and
then we use a redstone torch go up block

750
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,170
then we use a redstone torch go up block
 

751
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,430
then we use a redstone torch go up block
on top and then we're gonna make these

752
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
on top and then we're gonna make these
 

753
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,480
on top and then we're gonna make these
blocks come out redstone dust on this

754
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,490
blocks come out redstone dust on this
 

755
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,670
blocks come out redstone dust on this
side so that's that redstone torch is

756
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
side so that's that redstone torch is
 

757
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,650
side so that's that redstone torch is
powering over here we need three

758
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:11,660
powering over here we need three
 

759
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,220
powering over here we need three
repeaters set these at four this is the

760
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,230
repeaters set these at four this is the
 

761
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,130
repeaters set these at four this is the
give time for the brewing stand to clear

762
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,140
give time for the brewing stand to clear
 

763
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,410
give time for the brewing stand to clear
out the the finished brew before it

764
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:20,420
out the the finished brew before it
 

765
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,560
out the the finished brew before it
sends in new bottles and then we add

766
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:23,570
sends in new bottles and then we add
 

767
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,530
sends in new bottles and then we add
some redstone in the corners here and a

768
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:26,540
some redstone in the corners here and a
 

769
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,390
some redstone in the corners here and a
repeater set at one another one set at

770
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,400
repeater set at one another one set at
 

771
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,670
repeater set at one another one set at
one very good very good so now with that

772
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:30,680
one very good very good so now with that
 

773
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,110
one very good very good so now with that
I think we're done building it we just

774
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,120
I think we're done building it we just
 

775
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,970
I think we're done building it we just
need to stock it with ingredients and

776
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:33,980
need to stock it with ingredients and
 

777
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,250
need to stock it with ingredients and
get it running get the first few brews

778
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,260
get it running get the first few brews
 

779
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,530
get it running get the first few brews
happening which actually I find a little

780
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,540
happening which actually I find a little
 

781
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,120
happening which actually I find a little
bit difficult I haven't quite figured it

782
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,130
bit difficult I haven't quite figured it
 

783
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,300
bit difficult I haven't quite figured it
out but we'll see if we can here

784
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,310
out but we'll see if we can here
 

785
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,830
out but we'll see if we can here
so we'll stock it with ingredients let's

786
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:44,840
so we'll stock it with ingredients let's
 

787
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,960
so we'll stock it with ingredients let's
do that so underneath here we have this

788
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:46,970
do that so underneath here we have this
 

789
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,330
do that so underneath here we have this
one hopper for the blaze powder throw

790
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,340
one hopper for the blaze powder throw
 

791
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,240
one hopper for the blaze powder throw
that in in the chest tears for our empty

792
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,250
that in in the chest tears for our empty
 

793
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,770
that in in the chest tears for our empty
bottles we'll throw those in and then

794
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:55,780
bottles we'll throw those in and then
 

795
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,040
bottles we'll throw those in and then
let me grab a dropper real quick here

796
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,050
let me grab a dropper real quick here
 

797
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,020
let me grab a dropper real quick here
yeah so one thing I didn't mention like

798
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,030
yeah so one thing I didn't mention like
 

799
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,730
yeah so one thing I didn't mention like
this brewing we're doing right now is

800
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:03,740
this brewing we're doing right now is
 

801
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,770
this brewing we're doing right now is
for night vision potions splash night

802
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:05,780
for night vision potions splash night
 

803
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,199
for night vision potions splash night
vision extended potions that's four

804
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:08,209
vision extended potions that's four
 

805
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,970
vision extended potions that's four
steps to brewing but some potions like

806
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:09,980
steps to brewing but some potions like
 

807
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,189
steps to brewing but some potions like
invisibility potions would be maybe be

808
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:12,199
invisibility potions would be maybe be
 

809
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,290
invisibility potions would be maybe be
five steps and that's impossible

810
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,300
five steps and that's impossible
 

811
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,840
five steps and that's impossible
with our current setup here if we want

812
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:16,850
with our current setup here if we want
 

813
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,520
with our current setup here if we want
to do a five step brew we need to add

814
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,530
to do a five step brew we need to add
 

815
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,970
to do a five step brew we need to add
another dropper here run that on top and

816
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:21,980
another dropper here run that on top and
 

817
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,640
another dropper here run that on top and
then might have a hopper or a barrel or

818
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:24,650
then might have a hopper or a barrel or
 

819
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,820
then might have a hopper or a barrel or
something over here okay and if you do

820
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:27,830
something over here okay and if you do
 

821
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,290
something over here okay and if you do
that make sure you put the nether work

822
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,300
that make sure you put the nether work
 

823
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,690
that make sure you put the nether work
in this dropper but since we're only

824
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:31,700
in this dropper but since we're only
 

825
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,110
in this dropper but since we're only
doing

826
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,120
doing
 

827
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,180
doing
or stepper I'm gonna remove that and the

828
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,190
or stepper I'm gonna remove that and the
 

829
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,810
or stepper I'm gonna remove that and the
nether wart goes into that one the order

830
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,820
nether wart goes into that one the order
 

831
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,880
nether wart goes into that one the order
you put these in does matter quite a bit

832
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:39,890
you put these in does matter quite a bit
 

833
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,590
you put these in does matter quite a bit
you want the nether work to shoot out

834
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
you want the nether work to shoot out
 

835
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,260
you want the nether work to shoot out
last this is the one that activates last

836
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,270
last this is the one that activates last
 

837
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,460
last this is the one that activates last
because it has to go through all this

838
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,470
because it has to go through all this
 

839
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,570
because it has to go through all this
delay set in to last is over here which

840
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:49,580
delay set in to last is over here which
 

841
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,560
delay set in to last is over here which
I will probably use for a redstone I

842
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:52,570
I will probably use for a redstone I
 

843
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,260
I will probably use for a redstone I
don't have a lot of redstone we're gonna

844
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,270
don't have a lot of redstone we're gonna
 

845
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,960
don't have a lot of redstone we're gonna
have to go mine some more after this and

846
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,970
have to go mine some more after this and
 

847
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,830
have to go mine some more after this and
then if you have gunpowder put it in one

848
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:02,840
then if you have gunpowder put it in one
 

849
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,049
then if you have gunpowder put it in one
of these all right and then your main

850
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:08,059
of these all right and then your main
 

851
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,549
of these all right and then your main
ingredient should probably be the first

852
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:09,559
ingredient should probably be the first
 

853
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:15,370
ingredient should probably be the first
thing that gets put in alright so that's

854
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,380
thing that gets put in alright so that's
 

855
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,070
thing that gets put in alright so that's
all loaded up ready to go we have to

856
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
all loaded up ready to go we have to
 

857
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
all loaded up ready to go we have to
kick-start the autofilter because it

858
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,290
kick-start the autofilter because it
 

859
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,190
kick-start the autofilter because it
doesn't like to do that so to do it I

860
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,200
doesn't like to do that so to do it I
 

861
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,260
doesn't like to do that so to do it I
think we can just put like one object in

862
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,270
think we can just put like one object in
 

863
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,070
think we can just put like one object in
here and take it out yeah so that's

864
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
here and take it out yeah so that's
 

865
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,810
here and take it out yeah so that's
going to go

866
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:31,820
going to go
 

867
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,360
going to go
this is ready for the ingredients okay

868
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,370
this is ready for the ingredients okay
 

869
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,980
this is ready for the ingredients okay
now this is the part that scares me the

870
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,990
now this is the part that scares me the
 

871
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,720
now this is the part that scares me the
most because I don't quite know how to

872
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:37,730
most because I don't quite know how to
 

873
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,790
most because I don't quite know how to
do it properly I guess let's just flip

874
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:39,800
do it properly I guess let's just flip
 

875
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,790
do it properly I guess let's just flip
it up and see what happens here the

876
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:42,800
it up and see what happens here the
 

877
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,810
it up and see what happens here the
blaze powder is going in that's good I

878
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:45,820
blaze powder is going in that's good I
 

879
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,850
blaze powder is going in that's good I
don't think it activated ingredients

880
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:48,860
don't think it activated ingredients
 

881
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,920
don't think it activated ingredients
though okay I see what happened here I

882
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:50,930
though okay I see what happened here I
 

883
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,560
though okay I see what happened here I
have the barrel I broke stuck in there I

884
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,570
have the barrel I broke stuck in there I
 

885
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,730
have the barrel I broke stuck in there I
think if we just replaced that with

886
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:54,740
think if we just replaced that with
 

887
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,120
think if we just replaced that with
another word it might be fine I just

888
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,130
another word it might be fine I just
 

889
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,360
another word it might be fine I just
grabbed another word out of it I think

890
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,370
grabbed another word out of it I think
 

891
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,220
grabbed another word out of it I think
it'll be okay if we do that so it starts

892
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,230
it'll be okay if we do that so it starts
 

893
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,960
it'll be okay if we do that so it starts
with another word they'll end with

894
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:04,970
with another word they'll end with
 

895
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,340
with another word they'll end with
another work because that comes out last

896
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,350
another work because that comes out last
 

897
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,970
another work because that comes out last

901
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,220
we're gonna just take out they never got
brewed but otherwise I think it's going

902
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,230
brewed but otherwise I think it's going
 

903
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,700
brewed but otherwise I think it's going
to be okay now

904
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,710
to be okay now
 

905
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,290

that's fine I'm not checking if we run
 

943
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,570

out of these ingredients up here you

944
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:01,580
out of these ingredients up here you
 

945
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,600
out of these ingredients up here you
could if you wanted to just hook some

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:04,610
could if you wanted to just hook some
 

947
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,130
could if you wanted to just hook some
comparators up to these droppers and

948
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,140
comparators up to these droppers and
 

949
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,730
comparators up to these droppers and
send it to this locking line and then if

950
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:09,740
send it to this locking line and then if
 

951
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,430
send it to this locking line and then if
you run out it won't keep brewing but

952
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,440
you run out it won't keep brewing but
 

953
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,170
you run out it won't keep brewing but
that'll bulk up the design a little bit

954
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:14,180
that'll bulk up the design a little bit
 

955
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,390
that'll bulk up the design a little bit
alright so that's why I didn't do it but

956
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
alright so that's why I didn't do it but
 

957
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,770
alright so that's why I didn't do it but
otherwise I think it should be pretty

958
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:17,780
otherwise I think it should be pretty
 

959
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,830
otherwise I think it should be pretty
good here this is so weird

960
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:22,840
good here this is so weird
 

961
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,580
good here this is so weird
so I just walked over here and like that

962
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:27,590
so I just walked over here and like that
 

963
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,590
so I just walked over here and like that
looks like a villager is that the

964
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
looks like a villager is that the
 

965
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,870
looks like a villager is that the
traveling merchant or why does he look

966
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:31,880
traveling merchant or why does he look
 

967
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,620
traveling merchant or why does he look
so weird

968
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:32,630
so weird
 

969
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,580
so weird
it's a villager - cleric a master rank

970
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:36,590
it's a villager - cleric a master rank
 

971
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,000
it's a villager - cleric a master rank
one he was just wandering he was

972
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,010
one he was just wandering he was
 

973
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,120
one he was just wandering he was
wandering around here I think he's from

974
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,130
wandering around here I think he's from
 

975
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,710
wandering around here I think he's from
my underground village I don't know how

976
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
my underground village I don't know how
 

977
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
my underground village I don't know how
he got above-ground though oh wait I

978
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,370
he got above-ground though oh wait I
 

979
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,030
he got above-ground though oh wait I
might have an idea he's not supposed to

980
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,040
might have an idea he's not supposed to
 

981
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,240
might have an idea he's not supposed to
be on the surface though very very weird

982
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,250
be on the surface though very very weird
 

983
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,640
be on the surface though very very weird
that he's up on the surface let's just

984
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:57,650
that he's up on the surface let's just
 

985
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,440
that he's up on the surface let's just
lock him in make sure nobody can get him

986
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,450
lock him in make sure nobody can get him
 

987
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,360
lock him in make sure nobody can get him
keep him nice and safe did he get out

988
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,370
keep him nice and safe did he get out
 

989
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,020
keep him nice and safe did he get out
through the school I wonder that's the

990
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,030
through the school I wonder that's the
 

991
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,100
through the school I wonder that's the
only thing I can think of let's go down

992
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,110
only thing I can think of let's go down
 

993
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,250
only thing I can think of let's go down
the llamas unfortunately died that we're

994
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,260
the llamas unfortunately died that we're
 

995
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:22,540
the llamas unfortunately died that we're
in the llama Vader hmm I think the only

996
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:22,550
in the llama Vader hmm I think the only
 

997
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,010
in the llama Vader hmm I think the only
way they could possibly get to the

998
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,020
way they could possibly get to the
 

999
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,010
way they could possibly get to the
surface is over here

1000
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,020

 

1001
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:36,220

oh it is open so maybe he went up here

1002
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,230

 

1003
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,350

so it might have been a baby Ben that

1004
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
so it might have been a baby Ben that
 

1005
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,870
so it might have been a baby Ben that
grew up but it no it's a mastering guy

1006
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
grew up but it no it's a mastering guy
 

1007
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,880
grew up but it no it's a mastering guy
like I don't know that's that's strange

1008
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:48,890
like I don't know that's that's strange
 

1009
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,320
like I don't know that's that's strange
but yeah anyways we were supposed to

1010
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,330
but yeah anyways we were supposed to
 

1011
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,390
but yeah anyways we were supposed to
work on the B stuff today but I don't

1012
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,400
work on the B stuff today but I don't
 

1013
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,650
work on the B stuff today but I don't
think we're gonna have time to get to it

1014
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:54,660
think we're gonna have time to get to it
 

1015
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,890
think we're gonna have time to get to it
here and I also like I got I got

1016
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:57,900
here and I also like I got I got
 

1017
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,690
here and I also like I got I got
distracted with the burning stuff but

1018
00:21:59,690 --> 00:21:59,700
distracted with the burning stuff but
 

1019
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,490
distracted with the burning stuff but
also kind of wanted to get more

1020
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,500
also kind of wanted to get more
 

1021
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,960
also kind of wanted to get more
honeycomb saved up here so I've just

1022
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:02,970
honeycomb saved up here so I've just
 

1023
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,440
honeycomb saved up here so I've just
been laying this run so that we can is

1024
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,450
been laying this run so that we can is
 

1025
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,020
been laying this run so that we can is
make several stacks of the beehives like

1026
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,030
make several stacks of the beehives like
 

1027
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,360
make several stacks of the beehives like
right away when we're building it but I

1028
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,370
right away when we're building it but I
 

1029
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,070
right away when we're building it but I
also ran into a little bit of a problem

1030
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,080
also ran into a little bit of a problem
 

1031
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,520
also ran into a little bit of a problem
here

1032
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:13,530
here
 

1033
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,410
here
like I've been trying to perfect the

1034
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:15,420
like I've been trying to perfect the
 

1035
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,230
like I've been trying to perfect the
design a little bit I noticed one thing

1036
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
design a little bit I noticed one thing
 

1037
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,720
design a little bit I noticed one thing
for example like as I was testing it

1038
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:20,730
for example like as I was testing it
 

1039
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,360
for example like as I was testing it
when I had the glass at this level

1040
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,370
when I had the glass at this level
 

1041
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,090
when I had the glass at this level
sometimes the stuff would shoot out side

1042
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,100
sometimes the stuff would shoot out side
 

1043
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,870
sometimes the stuff would shoot out side
the glass

1044
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
the glass
 

1045
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
the glass
I need the two high area here I also

1046
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:29,730
I need the two high area here I also
 

1047
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,460
I need the two high area here I also
kind of prefer this because I can easily

1048
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,470
kind of prefer this because I can easily
 

1049
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,770
kind of prefer this because I can easily
walk in here and and breed the bees or

1050
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:33,780
walk in here and and breed the bees or
 

1051
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,600
walk in here and and breed the bees or
whatever when I'm setting it up so I

1052
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:35,610
whatever when I'm setting it up so I
 

1053
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,130
whatever when I'm setting it up so I
think that's good like that with the two

1054
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,140
think that's good like that with the two
 

1055
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,130
think that's good like that with the two
high area but I had an issue here you

1056
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,140
high area but I had an issue here you
 

1057
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,640
high area but I had an issue here you
can see one of these honey combs is full

1058
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:42,650
can see one of these honey combs is full
 

1059
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,040
can see one of these honey combs is full
for some reason like there was a shear

1060
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,050
for some reason like there was a shear
 

1061
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,060
for some reason like there was a shear
in there but it didn't activate which is

1062
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,070
in there but it didn't activate which is
 

1063
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,640
in there but it didn't activate which is
very strange I feel like it may be

1064
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:52,650
very strange I feel like it may be
 

1065
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,000
very strange I feel like it may be
glitches out like if the chunk is lazy

1066
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,010
glitches out like if the chunk is lazy
 

1067
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,310
glitches out like if the chunk is lazy
loaded or something maybe it doesn't

1068
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
loaded or something maybe it doesn't
 

1069
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,340
loaded or something maybe it doesn't
work the same and if it gets stuck like

1070
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,350
work the same and if it gets stuck like
 

1071
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,049
work the same and if it gets stuck like
that where the honey combs full it'll

1072
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:03,059
that where the honey combs full it'll
 

1073
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,260
that where the honey combs full it'll
never clear itself so I think I'm gonna

1074
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,270
never clear itself so I think I'm gonna
 

1075
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,930
never clear itself so I think I'm gonna
have to avoid using the observers in the

1076
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:08,940
have to avoid using the observers in the
 

1077
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,850
have to avoid using the observers in the
design here actually I think you can

1078
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:10,860
design here actually I think you can
 

1079
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,169
design here actually I think you can
glitch out I'm not sure why though like

1080
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:15,179
glitch out I'm not sure why though like
 

1081
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,240
glitch out I'm not sure why though like
I can I can manually fix it if I want

1082
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,250
I can I can manually fix it if I want
 

1083
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,270
I can I can manually fix it if I want
I'd like that but that's gonna keep

1084
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,280
I'd like that but that's gonna keep
 

1085
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,780
I'd like that but that's gonna keep
happening with this design

1086
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:22,790
happening with this design
 

1087
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,400
happening with this design
so I think I might switch over to like a

1088
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,410
so I think I might switch over to like a
 

1089
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,710
so I think I might switch over to like a
timer based system instead like set up a

1090
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:27,720
timer based system instead like set up a
 

1091
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,680
timer based system instead like set up a
hopper clock that just activates it

1092
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,690
hopper clock that just activates it
 

1093
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,890
hopper clock that just activates it
every every so often like the time it

1094
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:33,900
every every so often like the time it
 

1095
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,750
every every so often like the time it
takes them to collect the flowers and

1096
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
takes them to collect the flowers and
 

1097
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,299
takes them to collect the flowers and
produce the honey so if you're ever

1098
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:38,309
produce the honey so if you're ever
 

1099
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,340
produce the honey so if you're ever
wondering like where does ether get his

1100
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,350
wondering like where does ether get his
 

1101
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,190
wondering like where does ether get his
redstone from like really I never see

1102
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
redstone from like really I never see
 

1103
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,669
redstone from like really I never see
him getting redstone it's it's from down

1104
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:46,679
him getting redstone it's it's from down
 

1105
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,669
him getting redstone it's it's from down
here I do have a witch firm set up kind
