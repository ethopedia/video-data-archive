so we are going to put sandstone there

52
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
so we are going to put sandstone there
 

53
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,350
so we are going to put sandstone there
and let's see

54
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
and let's see
 

55
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,149
and let's see
that that

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159

 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,230

okay double doors so that we can get

58
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
okay double doors so that we can get
 

59
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,270
okay double doors so that we can get
more villagers

60
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
more villagers
 

61
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,670
more villagers
i i hope that doesn't conflict with

62
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
i i hope that doesn't conflict with
 

63
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,910
i i hope that doesn't conflict with
their ai at all i don't think it does

64
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
their ai at all i don't think it does
 

65
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,350
their ai at all i don't think it does
but i haven't seen too many people use

66
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
but i haven't seen too many people use
 

67
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,950
but i haven't seen too many people use
double doors in villages so maybe

68
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
double doors in villages so maybe
 

69
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,310
double doors in villages so maybe
there's a reason for that

70
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320

 

71
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,390

okay that's that's the start of it we're

72
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
okay that's that's the start of it we're
 

73
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,149
okay that's that's the start of it we're
gonna put

and let's mark out the other corners too
i think i need

92
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
i think i need
 

93
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,589

well it's an eight by eight right so the

100
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
well it's an eight by eight right so the
 

101
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,670
well it's an eight by eight right so the
other corner would be

102
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
other corner would be
 

103
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,030
other corner would be
right at the end of where i marked this

104
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
right at the end of where i marked this
 

105
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,790
right at the end of where i marked this
i guess one two three four five six

106
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
i guess one two three four five six
 

107

five blocks to all these houses so
 

113
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,750
five blocks to all these houses so
uh what's let's do this next

114
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
uh what's let's do this next
 

115
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,750
uh what's let's do this next
i'm gonna put that there

116
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760

 

117
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,390

and iron bars

118
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400

 

119
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,350

over there another one there these

120
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
over there another one there these
 

121
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,990
over there another one there these
lights

122
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
lights
 

123
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,790
lights
i think what i'm gonna do with them is

124
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
i think what i'm gonna do with them is
 

125
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,710
i think what i'm gonna do with them is
make them detect when the villagers are

126
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
make them detect when the villagers are
 

127
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,990
make them detect when the villagers are
inside for the night

128
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
inside for the night
 

129
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,470
inside for the night
these lights will come on uh not

130
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
these lights will come on uh not
 

131
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,990
these lights will come on uh not
entirely sure how i'm doing it yet

132
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
entirely sure how i'm doing it yet
 

133
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,630
entirely sure how i'm doing it yet
though

134
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
though
 

135
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,110
though
but that's kind of the plan with those

136
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120

 

137
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:16,830

that that

138
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

139
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,229

uh-huh so

140
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
uh-huh so
 

141
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,830
uh-huh so
with this circle in the middle i'm going

142
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
with this circle in the middle i'm going
 

143
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,309
with this circle in the middle i'm going
to try i'm going to put grass where i

144
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
to try i'm going to put grass where i
 

145
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,750
to try i'm going to put grass where i
have the stone bricks and

146
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
have the stone bricks and
 

147
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,509
have the stone bricks and
nether brick where the glass is and

148
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
nether brick where the glass is and
 

149
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,990
nether brick where the glass is and
we're just going to cover up the lava

150
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
we're just going to cover up the lava
 

151
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,030
we're just going to cover up the lava
i think that will be pretty cool uh

152
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
i think that will be pretty cool uh
 

153
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,149
i think that will be pretty cool uh
because i

154
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
because i
 

155
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,910
because i
the grass will be dark green and the

156
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
the grass will be dark green and the
 

157
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,670
the grass will be dark green and the
nether brick is like burgundy and i

158
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
nether brick is like burgundy and i
 

159
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,869
nether brick is like burgundy and i
think those are color

160
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
think those are color
 

161
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,470
think those are color
opposites so they'll really contrast and

162
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
opposites so they'll really contrast and
 

163
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,670
opposites so they'll really contrast and
it might look

164
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
it might look
 

165
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,949
it might look
might look good

166
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
might look good
 

167
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,110
might look good
okay we do that and

168
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120

 

169
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,789

same with over on this side we're just

170
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
same with over on this side we're just
 

171
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,750
same with over on this side we're just
going to copy that

172
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760

 

173
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,789

there there

174
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799

 

175
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,429

stairs

176
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439

183
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,710

for where i have these iron bars there's

184
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
for where i have these iron bars there's

going to be lava behind
 

187
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,710
going to be lava behind

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
so maybe maybe i'll just get these set
 

189
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,110
so maybe maybe i'll just get these set

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
in place
 

199
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,390
in place

changing in the next patch i won't be
able to

522

able to
 

523
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,710
able to
exploit it like i am now which i'm only

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
uh this minecart thing keeps breaking
 

537
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,629
uh this minecart thing keeps breaking
i think i'm going to add an and gate to

538
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
i think i'm going to add an and gate to
 

539
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,910
i think i'm going to add an and gate to
it so

540
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
it so
 

541
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,110
it so
i can turn it off that way big slimes

542
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
i can turn it off that way big slimes
 

543
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,509
i can turn it off that way big slimes
can actually build up here like this

544
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
can actually build up here like this
 

545
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,350
can actually build up here like this
because up before they would just always

546
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
because up before they would just always
 

547
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,269
because up before they would just always
take off if i have an andy that i can

548
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
take off if i have an andy that i can
 

549
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,430
take off if i have an andy that i can
choose if i want them to

550
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
choose if i want them to
 

551
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,189
choose if i want them to
go around the track or if i want them to

552
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
go around the track or if i want them to

go around the track or if i want them to
stay here

554
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079

 

555
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,590

so i was actually able to trade with

556
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
so i was actually able to trade with
 

557
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,189
so i was actually able to trade with
this guy three

this guy three
 

559
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,829
this guy three
massive paper trades uh before it went

560
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
massive paper trades uh before it went
 

561
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,350
massive paper trades uh before it went
away

562
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
away
 

563
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,110
away
uh now he's got this clock deal and it's

564
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
uh now he's got this clock deal and it's
 

565
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,949
uh now he's got this clock deal and it's
it's the worst i don't want a clock

566
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
it's the worst i don't want a clock
 

567
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,790
it's the worst i don't want a clock
that's expensive um

568
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
that's expensive um
 

569
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,870
that's expensive um
let's hope we get a new trade the first

570
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
let's hope we get a new trade the first
 

571
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,629
let's hope we get a new trade the first
try

572
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
try
 

573
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,629
try
i bet you with those new uh picture

574
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
i bet you with those new uh picture
 

575
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,910
i bet you with those new uh picture
frame things coming out

576
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
frame things coming out
 

577
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,829
frame things coming out
that you can mount items in i bet if you

578
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
that you can mount items in i bet if you
 

579
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,550
that you can mount items in i bet if you
put a clock in it you'll be able to see

580
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
put a clock in it you'll be able to see
 

581
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,509
put a clock in it you'll be able to see
the time when it's in the frame that

582
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
the time when it's in the frame that
 

583
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,829
the time when it's in the frame that
would be cool

584
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
would be cool
 

585
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,189
would be cool
i would actually have those all over the

586
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
i would actually have those all over the
 

587
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,710
i would actually have those all over the
place dang it

588
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720

 

589
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,990

just went through all this trouble to

590
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
just went through all this trouble to
 

591
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,470
just went through all this trouble to
get these emeralds and

592
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
get these emeralds and
 

593
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,110
get these emeralds and
gonna have to sacrifice them if i wasn't

594
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
gonna have to sacrifice them if i wasn't
 

595
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,790
gonna have to sacrifice them if i wasn't
exploiting it

596
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
exploiting it
 

597
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,430
exploiting it
you know i would never get 11 emeralds

598
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
you know i would never get 11 emeralds
 

599
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,590
you know i would never get 11 emeralds
for a clock

600
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600

 

601
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,829

oh

602
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839

 

603
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,110

well don't really need that either

604
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
well don't really need that either
 

605
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,030
well don't really need that either
sand isn't tarted yet

606
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040

 

607
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,870

let's try get a new one i want the paper

608
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
let's try get a new one i want the paper
 

609
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,269
let's try get a new one i want the paper
one back

610
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
one back
 

611
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,230
one back
and hopefully get a low a low rate this

612
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
and hopefully get a low a low rate this
 

613
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,189
and hopefully get a low a low rate this
time

614
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199

 

615
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,110

ah 27 that's that's still near the max

616
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
ah 27 that's that's still near the max
 

617
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,470
ah 27 that's that's still near the max
but at least we got something back

618
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480

 

619
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,030

yeah we got all four houses done

620
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040

 

621
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,389

but there's still only two villagers and

622
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
but there's still only two villagers and
 

623
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,910
but there's still only two villagers and
it's gonna be like that way for a little

624
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
it's gonna be like that way for a little
 

625
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,710
it's gonna be like that way for a little
bit

626
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
bit
 

627
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,310
bit
um each door each valid door only counts

628
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
um each door each valid door only counts
 

629
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,310
um each door each valid door only counts
as 0.35 of a villager

630
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
as 0.35 of a villager
 

631
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,550
as 0.35 of a villager
so 8 times 0.35 is 2.8 so

632
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
so 8 times 0.35 is 2.8 so
 

633
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,230
so 8 times 0.35 is 2.8 so
one more door and we could get another

634
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
one more door and we could get another
 

635
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,629
one more door and we could get another
villager in our village

636
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
villager in our village
 

637
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,949
villager in our village
uh it's actually surprising how they did

638
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
uh it's actually surprising how they did
 

639
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,949
uh it's actually surprising how they did
that because you need so many doors like

640
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
that because you need so many doors like
 

641
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,310
that because you need so many doors like
i have

642
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
i have
 

643
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,670
i have
i have four houses here each with

644
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
i have four houses here each with
 

645
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,590
i have four houses here each with
two doors and it's still only enough for

646
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
two doors and it's still only enough for
 

647
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,710
two doors and it's still only enough for
two villagers so you need a whole

648
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
two villagers so you need a whole
 

649
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,749
two villagers so you need a whole
bunch of doors man to really get a

650
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
bunch of doors man to really get a
 

651
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,150
bunch of doors man to really get a
village thriving

652
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
village thriving
 

653
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,790
village thriving
um i don't think i mentioned it but

654
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
um i don't think i mentioned it but
 

655
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,310
um i don't think i mentioned it but
these houses

656
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
these houses
 

657
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,230
these houses
uh i talked about these indicator lights

658
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
uh i talked about these indicator lights
 

659
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,590
uh i talked about these indicator lights
before

660
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
before
 

661
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,710
before
i left a space

662
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
i left a space
 

663
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,670
i left a space
up here i can run redstone wire up there

664
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
up here i can run redstone wire up there
 

665
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,110
up here i can run redstone wire up there
to the lights

666
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
to the lights
 

667
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,670
to the lights
and connect it down below or at this

668
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
and connect it down below or at this
 

669
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,949
and connect it down below or at this
back wall somewhere

670
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
back wall somewhere
 

671
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,110
back wall somewhere
like i i could run a redstone torch

672
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
like i i could run a redstone torch
 

673
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,790
like i i could run a redstone torch
up there there's lots of different

674
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
up there there's lots of different
 

675
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,790
up there there's lots of different
places i could do it so

676
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
places i could do it so
 

677
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,430
places i could do it so
that's how i plan on wiring it um

678
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
that's how i plan on wiring it um
 

679
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,189
that's how i plan on wiring it um

up up the hill view um these houses

684
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
up up the hill view um these houses
 

685
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,430
up up the hill view um these houses
though they're pretty big

686

if i was to redo it i would probably
lower this

698
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
lower this
 

699
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,150

happened
it's gonna go behind the creeper face

816
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
it's gonna go behind the creeper face
 

817
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,510

like somewhere
around here too just because they're

822
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
around here too just because they're
 

823
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,390
around here too just because they're
it's starting to be quite a distance

824
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
it's starting to be quite a distance
 

825
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,909
it's starting to be quite a distance
between

826
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
between
 

827
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,350
between
this part of the base and that part of

828
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
this part of the base and that part of
 

829
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,230
this part of the base and that part of
the base but yeah we're gonna

830
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
the base but yeah we're gonna
 

831
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,390
the base but yeah we're gonna
try put it behind here

832
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400

 

833
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,789

not sure how this is gonna work out

834
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799

 

835
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,470

very easily i think

836
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
very easily i think
 

837
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,470
very easily i think
i think this lava's intact

838
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480

 

839
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,870

oh that's freaky yeah so we're going to

840
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
oh that's freaky yeah so we're going to
 

841
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,390
oh that's freaky yeah so we're going to
put it on the other side

842
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
put it on the other side
 

843
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,990
put it on the other side
we can get through to it by ender

844
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
we can get through to it by ender
 

845
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,990
we can get through to it by ender

um let's try this out

1138
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
um let's try this out
 

1139
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,750
um let's try this out
sweet so it'll shoot through this

1140
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
sweet so it'll shoot through this
 

1141

still got to do some wiring though with
 

1167
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,909
still got to do some wiring though with
our portal mechanics

1168
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919

 

1169
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,789

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
so basically we're going to have another
 

1179
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,789
so basically we're going to have another
button on the left side

1180
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
button on the left side
 

1181
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,389
button on the left side
this will control water

1182
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399

 

1183
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,590

let's clear the portal again

1184
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
let's clear the portal again
 

1185
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,870
let's clear the portal again
um and there's gonna be

1186
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880

 

1187
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,029

i'm gonna put two dispensers just for

1188
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
i'm gonna put two dispensers just for
 

1189
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,990
i'm gonna put two dispensers just for
the look of it

1190
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
the look of it
 

1191
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,029
the look of it
but we really only need one

1192
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
but we really only need one
 

1193
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,389
but we really only need one
and in that one

1194
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
and in that one
 

1195
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,630
and in that one
we need the water bucket it'll shoot

1196
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:28,640
we need the water bucket it'll shoot
 

1197
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,750
we need the water bucket it'll shoot
water out

1198
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
water out
 

1199
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,870
water out
which will make the portal

1200
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
which will make the portal
 

1201
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,310
which will make the portal
disappear and

1202
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
disappear and
 

1203
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,830
disappear and
then it has to scoop it back up so two

1204
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:38,840
then it has to scoop it back up so two
 

1205
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,590
then it has to scoop it back up so two
pulses

1206
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
pulses
 

1207
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,590
pulses
something else i kind of want to do when

1208
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
something else i kind of want to do when
 

1209
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,350
something else i kind of want to do when
i hit the fire

1210
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
i hit the fire
 

1211
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,909
i hit the fire
it'll light the portal then after a few

1212
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
it'll light the portal then after a few
 

1213
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,750
it'll light the portal then after a few
seconds i would like

1214
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
seconds i would like
 

1215
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,549
seconds i would like
it to trigger this maybe

1216
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
it to trigger this maybe
 

1217
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,310
it to trigger this maybe
maybe so it'll automatically disable

1218
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
maybe so it'll automatically disable
 

1219
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,669
maybe so it'll automatically disable
itself when i

1220
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
itself when i
 

1221
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,070
itself when i
when i reload this region when i come

1222
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
when i reload this region when i come
 

1223
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,549
when i reload this region when i come
back from the nether

1224
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
back from the nether
 

1225
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,549
back from the nether
that way i don't get pigment in here and

1226
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
that way i don't get pigment in here and
 

1227
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,230
that way i don't get pigment in here and
stuff like that

1228
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
stuff like that
 

1229
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,190
stuff like that
maybe maybe

1230
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200

 

1231
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,630

okay so i did the wiring for the water

1232
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
okay so i did the wiring for the water
 

1233
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,389
okay so i did the wiring for the water
gun or whatever it is

1234
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
gun or whatever it is
 

1235
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,630
gun or whatever it is
um does that

1236
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
um does that
 

1237
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,470
um does that
it's pretty good doesn't spill over or

1238
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
it's pretty good doesn't spill over or
 

1239
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,070
it's pretty good doesn't spill over or
anything

1240
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
anything
 

1241
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,549
anything
uh what i've done let's take you back

1242
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
uh what i've done let's take you back
 

1243
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,350
uh what i've done let's take you back
here

1244
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360

 

1245
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,149

this is the block that the buttons on

1246
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
this is the block that the buttons on
 

1247
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,389
this is the block that the buttons on
and then i just have a repeater here

1248
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
and then i just have a repeater here
 

1249
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,630
and then i just have a repeater here
to make it go out a little further

1250
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
to make it go out a little further
 

1251
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,950
to make it go out a little further
and then it goes to this monostable

1252
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
and then it goes to this monostable
 

1253
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,990
and then it goes to this monostable
circuit here

1254
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
circuit here
 

1255
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,430
circuit here
this this uh triangle right triangle

1256
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
this this uh triangle right triangle
 

1257
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,430
this this uh triangle right triangle
shape thing um torch

1258
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
shape thing um torch
 

1259
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,510
shape thing um torch
then that powers this wire here

1260
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
then that powers this wire here
 

1261
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,230
then that powers this wire here
goes to another torch and in between we

1262
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
goes to another torch and in between we
 

1263
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,750
goes to another torch and in between we
have this repeater

1264
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
have this repeater
 

1265
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,830
have this repeater
have to set that to four otherwise the

1266
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
have to set that to four otherwise the
 

1267
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,590
have to set that to four otherwise the
pulse is not long enough for the

1268
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
pulse is not long enough for the
 

1269
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,630
pulse is not long enough for the
dispenser to register it

1270
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
dispenser to register it
 

1271
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,430
dispenser to register it
and from there one wire goes directly to

1272
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,440
and from there one wire goes directly to
 

1273
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,029
and from there one wire goes directly to
the dispenser and then another

1274
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
the dispenser and then another
 

1275
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,310
the dispenser and then another
this repeater goes

1276
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
this repeater goes
 

1277
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,350
this repeater goes
down to this wire here and

1278
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
down to this wire here and
 

1279
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,750
down to this wire here and
it has a spacing of two ticks so right

1280
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
it has a spacing of two ticks so right
 

1281
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,350
it has a spacing of two ticks so right
after this pulse

1282
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,360
after this pulse
 

1283
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,470
after this pulse
this one goes two ticks later and scoops

1284
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
this one goes two ticks later and scoops
 

1285
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,230
this one goes two ticks later and scoops
it back up

1286
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
it back up
 

1287
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,350
it back up
and that's all we got to do

1288
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
and that's all we got to do
 

1289
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,029
and that's all we got to do
so i'm gonna maybe put

1290
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
so i'm gonna maybe put
 

1291
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,110
so i'm gonna maybe put
these here just for looks as well to

1292
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
these here just for looks as well to
 

1293
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,190
these here just for looks as well to
bounce out the look

1294
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200

 

1295
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,190

and put that there

1296
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200

 

1297
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,750

yeah it's not not ideal

1298
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
yeah it's not not ideal
 

1299
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,110
yeah it's not not ideal
but let's try it out anyway

1300
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
but let's try it out anyway
 

1301
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,909
but let's try it out anyway
fire water

1302
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919

 

1303
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,029

fire water

1304
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
fire water
 

1305
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,789
fire water
cool

1306
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799

 

1307
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,149

yeah i'm not entirely happy with how

1308
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
yeah i'm not entirely happy with how
 

1309
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,909
yeah i'm not entirely happy with how
that looks the backing

1310
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
that looks the backing
 

1311
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,870
that looks the backing
but i'll i'll mess with that later i

1312
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
but i'll i'll mess with that later i
 

1313
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,470
but i'll i'll mess with that later i
think that's all we're gonna do for

1314
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
think that's all we're gonna do for
 

1315
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,509
think that's all we're gonna do for
today so let's get

1316
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
today so let's get
 

1317
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,750
today so let's get
to the comment reading thing and wrap

1318
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
to the comment reading thing and wrap
 

1319
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,990
to the comment reading thing and wrap
this up

1320
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
this up
 

1321
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,310
this up
we got two comments for today guys

1322
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
we got two comments for today guys
 

1323
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,110
we got two comments for today guys
number one

1324
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120

 

1325
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,350

etho i was thinking about a style for

1326
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
etho i was thinking about a style for
 

1327
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,190
etho i was thinking about a style for
your village seeing as how you like

1328
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
your village seeing as how you like
 

1329
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,070
your village seeing as how you like
green grass

1330
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
green grass
 

1331
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,909
green grass
and such maybe you could make like a

1332
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:34,919
and such maybe you could make like a
 

1333
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,230
and such maybe you could make like a
huge

1334
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
huge
 

1335
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,389
huge
tree in the middle of the cave you dug

1336
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
tree in the middle of the cave you dug
 

1337
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,830
tree in the middle of the cave you dug
out for them

1338
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
out for them
 

1339
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,430
out for them
with the branches kind of holding up the

1340
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
with the branches kind of holding up the
 

1341
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,350
with the branches kind of holding up the
ceiling and you could

1342
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
ceiling and you could
 

1343
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,750
ceiling and you could
pumpkins hanging from the tree which

1344
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
pumpkins hanging from the tree which
 

1345
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,029
pumpkins hanging from the tree which
would look naturalish

1346
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
would look naturalish
 

1347
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,029
would look naturalish
and then you'd use leaves and other

1348
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
and then you'd use leaves and other
 

1349
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,870
and then you'd use leaves and other
materials and grass blocks for the

1350
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
materials and grass blocks for the
 

1351
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,070
materials and grass blocks for the
ground

1352
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
ground
 

1353
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,470
ground
and the houses could also look like they

1354
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
and the houses could also look like they
 

1355
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,509
and the houses could also look like they
are hanging

1356
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
are hanging
 

1357
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,710
are hanging
maybe with wood etc that is a pretty

1358
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
maybe with wood etc that is a pretty
 

1359
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,070
maybe with wood etc that is a pretty
cool idea for village

1360
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
cool idea for village
 

1361
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,149
cool idea for village
and um maybe i'll use it one day in the

1362
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
and um maybe i'll use it one day in the
 

1363
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:04,710
and um maybe i'll use it one day in the
future

1364
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
future
 

1365
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,389
future
or somebody else will use it

1366
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
or somebody else will use it
 

1367
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,630
or somebody else will use it
he he went on to say in another comment

1368
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
he he went on to say in another comment
 

1369
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,909
he he went on to say in another comment
that it wouldn't really work here

1370
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
that it wouldn't really work here
 

1371
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,549
that it wouldn't really work here
because of

1372
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
because of
 

1373
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,590
because of
the dark green grass but i could see

1374
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:15,600
the dark green grass but i could see
 

1375
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,029
the dark green grass but i could see
doing that in a village and it would be

1376
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
doing that in a village and it would be
 

1377
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,750
doing that in a village and it would be
pretty cool i think

1378
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
pretty cool i think
 

1379
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,710
pretty cool i think
number two etho you should make a

1380
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
number two etho you should make a
 

1381
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,070
number two etho you should make a
villager fountain

1382
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
villager fountain
 

1383
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,630
villager fountain
that is to say a fountain that villagers

1384
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
that is to say a fountain that villagers
 

1385
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,509
that is to say a fountain that villagers
pop out

1386
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
pop out
 

1387
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,230
pop out
of after you trap them in your houses

1388
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
of after you trap them in your houses
 

1389
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,630
of after you trap them in your houses
and suck them underground

1390
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
and suck them underground
 

1391
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,990
and suck them underground
that is a cool idea too because we could

1392
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,000
that is a cool idea too because we could
 

1393
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,549
that is a cool idea too because we could
put a water fountain here or something

1394
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
put a water fountain here or something
 

1395
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,750
put a water fountain here or something
and then like i do know how to trap them

1396
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,760
and then like i do know how to trap them
 

1397
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,750
and then like i do know how to trap them
underground once they go into the

1398
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:43,760
underground once they go into the
 

1399
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,830
underground once they go into the
houses at night and then

1400
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
houses at night and then
 

1401
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,710
houses at night and then
have like a day sensor that would

1402
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
have like a day sensor that would
 

1403
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,549
have like a day sensor that would
trigger them all to pop up

1404
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
trigger them all to pop up
 

1405
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,549
trigger them all to pop up
through the fountain that could be cool

1406
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
through the fountain that could be cool
 

1407
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,909
through the fountain that could be cool
might do that

1408
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
might do that
 

1409
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,909
might do that
