um something i want to show you for

344
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
um something i want to show you for
 

345
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,469
um something i want to show you for
those of you making mob systems

346
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
those of you making mob systems
 

347
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,510
those of you making mob systems
the way i'm going about lighting up the

348
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
the way i'm going about lighting up the
 

349
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,869
the way i'm going about lighting up the
caves like that's what i need to do i

350
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
caves like that's what i need to do i
 

351
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,710
caves like that's what i need to do i
have to light up all the caves around

352
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
have to light up all the caves around
 

353
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,869
have to light up all the caves around
here

354
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
here
 

355
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,390
here
this is the center point of the mob

356
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
this is the center point of the mob
 

357
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,230
this is the center point of the mob
system i need to go at least

358
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
system i need to go at least
 

359
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,990
system i need to go at least
128 blocks all around the center point

360
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
128 blocks all around the center point
 

361
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,390
128 blocks all around the center point
but i plan on going a little further

362
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
but i plan on going a little further
 

363
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,150
but i plan on going a little further
than that as well because that

364
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
than that as well because that
 

365
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,230
than that as well because that
because we'll be moving around this area

366
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
because we'll be moving around this area
 

367
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,189
because we'll be moving around this area
so we need to go

368
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
so we need to go
 

369
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,909
so we need to go
further to make up for that the further

370
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
further to make up for that the further
 

371
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,710
further to make up for that the further
we

372
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
we
 

373
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,390
we
stand from that center point um

374
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
stand from that center point um
 

375
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,430
stand from that center point um
so i'll show you how i oh

376
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
so i'll show you how i oh
 

377
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,869
so i'll show you how i oh
i'll show you how i've been going about

378
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
i'll show you how i've been going about
 

379
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,830
i'll show you how i've been going about
lighting up the caves like

380
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
lighting up the caves like
 

381
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,589
lighting up the caves like
there's a major tape this way which i

382
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
there's a major tape this way which i
 

383
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,270
there's a major tape this way which i
have all lit up i couldn't find any more

384
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
have all lit up i couldn't find any more
 

385
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,189
have all lit up i couldn't find any more
dark spots so

386
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
dark spots so
 

387
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,629
dark spots so
at this point what i do is i go 100

388
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
at this point what i do is i go 100
 

389
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,190
at this point what i do is i go 100
blocks diagonally from the mob system

390
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
blocks diagonally from the mob system
 

391
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,670
blocks diagonally from the mob system
in in four directions so

392
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680

 

393
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,430

so our x is like negative 463 and our z

394
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
so our x is like negative 463 and our z
 

395
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,829
so our x is like negative 463 and our z
is 851 or so add and subtract 100 to all

396
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
is 851 or so add and subtract 100 to all
 

397
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,870
is 851 or so add and subtract 100 to all
those numbers

398
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
those numbers
 

399
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,150
those numbers
go to that spot those four four points

400
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
go to that spot those four four points
 

401
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,829
go to that spot those four four points
and uh i'll meet you there at one of

402
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
and uh i'll meet you there at one of
 

403
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,949
and uh i'll meet you there at one of
them

404
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959

 

405
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,949

okay so you can see the mob tower over

406
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
okay so you can see the mob tower over
 

407
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,030
okay so you can see the mob tower over
there that big snow tower that's our mob

408
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
there that big snow tower that's our mob
 

409
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,389
there that big snow tower that's our mob
system and that is our center point

410
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
system and that is our center point
 

411
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,269
system and that is our center point
so i went around that area as much as i

412
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
so i went around that area as much as i
 

413
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,990
so i went around that area as much as i
could looking for

414
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
could looking for
 

415
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,470
could looking for
caves lighting them up i can't really

416
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
caves lighting them up i can't really
 

417
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,190
caves lighting them up i can't really
find any more at this point so

418
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
find any more at this point so
 

419
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,829
find any more at this point so
it feels like i'm done all the taping i

420
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
it feels like i'm done all the taping i
 

421
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,590
it feels like i'm done all the taping i
need to do but i can tell by the mob

422
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
need to do but i can tell by the mob
 

423
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,150
need to do but i can tell by the mob
rates

424
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
rates
 

425
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,949
rates
it's still very slow so if you're making

426
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
it's still very slow so if you're making
 

427
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,550
it's still very slow so if you're making
a mob system you got to remember to

428
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
a mob system you got to remember to
 

429
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,829
a mob system you got to remember to
check the edges

430
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
check the edges
 

431
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,430
check the edges
of your of your radius so

432
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
of your of your radius so
 

433
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,269
of your of your radius so
i've gone 100 blocks on the negative

434
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
i've gone 100 blocks on the negative
 

435
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,030
i've gone 100 blocks on the negative
x and plus 100 on z to this point here

436
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
x and plus 100 on z to this point here
 

437
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,990
x and plus 100 on z to this point here
and i'll do the same

438
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
and i'll do the same
 

439
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,509
and i'll do the same
for over there there and diagonally that

440
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
for over there there and diagonally that
 

441
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,470
for over there there and diagonally that
way

442
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
way
 

443
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,150
way
and now this is where the controversy

444
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
and now this is where the controversy
 

445
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,710
and now this is where the controversy
begins

446
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
begins
 

447
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,389
begins
i make an x-ray machine at these points

448
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
i make an x-ray machine at these points
 

449
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,350
i make an x-ray machine at these points
and also one

450
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
and also one
 

451
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,230
and also one
in the center so usually i'll make five

452
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
in the center so usually i'll make five
 

453
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,710
in the center so usually i'll make five
total

454
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
total
 

455
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,230
total
to scan all the caves

456
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
to scan all the caves
 

457
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,269
to scan all the caves
and

458
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279

 

459
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,110

i'm not telling you to use an x-ray

460
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
i'm not telling you to use an x-ray
 

461
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,710
i'm not telling you to use an x-ray
machine you can if you want

462
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
machine you can if you want
 

463
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,790
machine you can if you want
if you don't mind using it this is just

464
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
if you don't mind using it this is just
 

465
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,750
if you don't mind using it this is just
the method i

466
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
the method i
 

467
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,269
the method i
i go about lighting up today's um

468
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
i go about lighting up today's um
 

469
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,949
i go about lighting up today's um
the reason it's a sensitive issue is

470
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
the reason it's a sensitive issue is
 

471
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,790
the reason it's a sensitive issue is
because a little while ago i mentioned i

472
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
because a little while ago i mentioned i
 

473
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,509
because a little while ago i mentioned i
do not like

474
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
do not like
 

475
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,949
do not like
sand duplicators and a lot of people

476
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
sand duplicators and a lot of people
 

477
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,670
sand duplicators and a lot of people
oh right there i got a cave a lot of

478
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
oh right there i got a cave a lot of
 

479
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,670
oh right there i got a cave a lot of
people tore into me about it

480
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
people tore into me about it
 

481
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,910
people tore into me about it
that i ha i'm some sort of a hypocrite

482
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
that i ha i'm some sort of a hypocrite
 

483
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,949
that i ha i'm some sort of a hypocrite
because i

484
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
because i
 

485
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,190
because i
i don't approve of the sand duplication

486
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
i don't approve of the sand duplication
 

487
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,110
i don't approve of the sand duplication
but i approve of the x-ray machine

488
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
but i approve of the x-ray machine
 

489
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,630
but i approve of the x-ray machine
you can see that's where i have all lit

490
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
you can see that's where i have all lit
 

491
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,910
you can see that's where i have all lit
up so i got a lot of work to do around

492
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
up so i got a lot of work to do around
 

493
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,630
up so i got a lot of work to do around
around this area it's all dark for the

494
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
around this area it's all dark for the
 

495
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,110
around this area it's all dark for the
most part

496
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
most part
 

497
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,829
most part
so i'll just briefly talk about that

498
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
so i'll just briefly talk about that
 

499
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,829
so i'll just briefly talk about that
um in minecraft you should do

500
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
um in minecraft you should do
 

501
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,069
um in minecraft you should do
whatever you whoa

502
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079

 

503
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,590

i don't i think that's natural i don't

504
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
i don't i think that's natural i don't
 

505
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,509
i don't i think that's natural i don't
think i dug that out

506
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
think i dug that out
 

507
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,030
think i dug that out
yeah do whatever you think is fun

508
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
yeah do whatever you think is fun
 

509
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,069
yeah do whatever you think is fun
right i play survival mode because i

510
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
right i play survival mode because i
 

511
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,190
right i play survival mode because i
enjoy the extra elements it adds to the

512
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
enjoy the extra elements it adds to the
 

513
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,590
enjoy the extra elements it adds to the
game

514
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
game
 

515
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,110
game
such as resource collection so that's

516
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
such as resource collection so that's
 

517
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,630
such as resource collection so that's
that's the reason i don't want to use

518
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
that's the reason i don't want to use
 

519
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,790
that's the reason i don't want to use
sand generators because

520
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
sand generators because
 

521
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,949
sand generators because
they will wreck my fun there's a tape

522
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
they will wreck my fun there's a tape
 

523
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,350
they will wreck my fun there's a tape
here too

524
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360

 

525
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,190

um but now if we go into x-ray machines

526
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
um but now if we go into x-ray machines
 

527
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,670
um but now if we go into x-ray machines
i'm not using it like obviously there's

528
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
i'm not using it like obviously there's
 

529
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,350
i'm not using it like obviously there's
right and wrong ways of using it you

530
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
right and wrong ways of using it you
 

531
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,350
right and wrong ways of using it you
would not want to go to

532
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
would not want to go to
 

533
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,670
would not want to go to
like a pvp server and use that to find

534
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
like a pvp server and use that to find
 

535
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,430
like a pvp server and use that to find
people's bases that would be

536
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
people's bases that would be
 

537
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,949
people's bases that would be
just wrong but in this case i feel it's

538
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
just wrong but in this case i feel it's
 

539
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,990
just wrong but in this case i feel it's
okay

540
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
okay
 

541
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,110
okay
it doesn't bother me because i'm just

542
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
it doesn't bother me because i'm just
 

543
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,550
it doesn't bother me because i'm just
looking for needles and haste

544
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
looking for needles and haste
 

545
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,269
looking for needles and haste
haystacks basically i don't want to do

546
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
haystacks basically i don't want to do
 

547
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,470
haystacks basically i don't want to do
that because it would be very

548
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
that because it would be very
 

549
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,430
that because it would be very
frustrating and it doesn't

550
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
frustrating and it doesn't
 

551
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,990
frustrating and it doesn't
really get me any benefits except saving

552
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
really get me any benefits except saving
 

553
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,710
really get me any benefits except saving
me

554
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
me
 

555
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,350
me
time and frustration that's the key we

556
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
time and frustration that's the key we
 

557
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,870
time and frustration that's the key we
saw

558
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
saw
 

559
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,509
saw
so that's my reasoning behind the x-ray

560
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
so that's my reasoning behind the x-ray
 

561
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,030
so that's my reasoning behind the x-ray
machine don't use it if you don't think

562
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
machine don't use it if you don't think
 

563
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,110
machine don't use it if you don't think
it's right

564
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
it's right
 

565
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,790
it's right
you can use sand duplicators if you

566
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
you can use sand duplicators if you
 

567
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,230
you can use sand duplicators if you
think it's okay

568
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
think it's okay
 

569
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,949
think it's okay
doesn't bother me just don't try to get

570
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
doesn't bother me just don't try to get
 

571
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,030
doesn't bother me just don't try to get
me to use one because i don't want to

572
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
me to use one because i don't want to
 

573
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,509
me to use one because i don't want to
which i get hundreds of comments every

574
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
which i get hundreds of comments every
 

575
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,269
which i get hundreds of comments every
time

576
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
time
 

577
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,910
time
i say or i do something involving sand

578
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
i say or i do something involving sand
 

579
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,629
i say or i do something involving sand
people tell me

580
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
people tell me
 

581
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,750
people tell me
just use a sand generator and that bugs

582
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
just use a sand generator and that bugs
 

583
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,430
just use a sand generator and that bugs
me

584
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
me
 

585
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,310
me
uh but anyway it's gonna be out of the

586
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
uh but anyway it's gonna be out of the
 

587
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,110
uh but anyway it's gonna be out of the
game soon i'll be happy

588
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120

 

589
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,350

so again i did some more caving there at

590
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
so again i did some more caving there at
 

591
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,790
so again i did some more caving there at
that spot we were just at

592
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
that spot we were just at
 

593
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,310
that spot we were just at
i found seven more stacks of redstone

594
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
i found seven more stacks of redstone
 

595
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,590
i found seven more stacks of redstone
and i got three stacks of iron a stack

596
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
and i got three stacks of iron a stack
 

597
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,629
and i got three stacks of iron a stack
of gold

598
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
of gold
 

599
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,310
of gold
then i went and did some enchanting i

600
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
then i went and did some enchanting i
 

601
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,990
then i went and did some enchanting i
just got this pick which is

602
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
just got this pick which is
 

603
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,030
just got this pick which is
amazing and now we gotta enchant the

604
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
amazing and now we gotta enchant the
 

605
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,949
amazing and now we gotta enchant the
shovel

606
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
shovel
 

607
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,430
shovel
which is not so amazing

608
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440

 

609
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,389

all right so let's head back to the

610
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
all right so let's head back to the
 

611
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,750
all right so let's head back to the
storage room area and we will start

612
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
storage room area and we will start
 

613
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,790
storage room area and we will start
figuring out our layout

614
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800

 

615
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,870

all right uh where to get started

616
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
all right uh where to get started
 

617
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,430
all right uh where to get started
how do you start a big project

618
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440

 

619
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,990

well yes one thing i'd like to do first

620
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
well yes one thing i'd like to do first
 

621
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,110
well yes one thing i'd like to do first
of all is figure out

622
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
of all is figure out
 

623
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,069
of all is figure out
the size of this room as it is right now

624
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
the size of this room as it is right now
 

625
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,110
the size of this room as it is right now
so let's see

626
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
so let's see
 

627
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,790
so let's see
negative 485. i'm just gonna write this

628
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
negative 485. i'm just gonna write this
 

629
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,590
negative 485. i'm just gonna write this
down

630
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600

 

631
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,110

just to give give us an idea of how big

632
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
just to give give us an idea of how big
 

633
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,790
just to give give us an idea of how big
we want this when it's all done

634
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
we want this when it's all done
 

635
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,030
we want this when it's all done
because this is starting to feel like

636
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
because this is starting to feel like
 

637
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,790
because this is starting to feel like
the the size

638
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
the the size
 

639
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,629
the the size
of the room i would want maybe a little

640
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
of the room i would want maybe a little
 

641
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,790
of the room i would want maybe a little
bit bigger yet

642
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
bit bigger yet
 

643
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,150
bit bigger yet
and over here negative 4

644
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160

 

645
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,189

46 so that's about 40 bucks on x

646
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
46 so that's about 40 bucks on x
 

647
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,949
46 so that's about 40 bucks on x
and 8 35 it's about

648
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
and 8 35 it's about
 

649
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,310
and 8 35 it's about
40 blocks on zed so this room's roughly

650
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
40 blocks on zed so this room's roughly
 

651
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,430
40 blocks on zed so this room's roughly
40 by 40

652
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
40 by 40
 

653
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,949
40 by 40
right now i probably

654
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
right now i probably
 

655
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,949
right now i probably
want to go at least a 50 by 50 room or

656
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
want to go at least a 50 by 50 room or
 

657
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,030
want to go at least a 50 by 50 room or
bigger

658
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
bigger
 

659
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,629
bigger
um and this is going to be our

660
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
um and this is going to be our
 

661
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,710
um and this is going to be our
centerpiece this

662
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
centerpiece this
 

663
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,829
centerpiece this
these emp units in the middle uh

664
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
these emp units in the middle uh
 

665
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,949
these emp units in the middle uh
i felt like what i wanted to do like i

666
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
i felt like what i wanted to do like i
 

667
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,670
i felt like what i wanted to do like i
don't have this all planned out

668
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
don't have this all planned out
 

669
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,670
don't have this all planned out
all that well just sort of in my head i

670
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
all that well just sort of in my head i
 

671
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,910
all that well just sort of in my head i
should figure out some details like

672
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
should figure out some details like
 

673
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,230
should figure out some details like
maybe plan it out in a paint program or

674
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
maybe plan it out in a paint program or
 

675
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,310
maybe plan it out in a paint program or
something

676
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
something
 

677
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,790
something
as we get into this but for the center

678
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
as we get into this but for the center
 

679
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,189
as we get into this but for the center
what i figure i wanted to do was

680
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
what i figure i wanted to do was
 

681
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,150
what i figure i wanted to do was
have have it raised off the ground a bit

682
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
have have it raised off the ground a bit
 

683
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,470
have have it raised off the ground a bit
like two blocks up or something

684
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
like two blocks up or something
 

685
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,910
like two blocks up or something
from the ground in our storage room

686
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
from the ground in our storage room
 

687
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,550
from the ground in our storage room
um and then create a platform we can

688
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
um and then create a platform we can
 

689
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,910
um and then create a platform we can
walk around

690
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
walk around
 

691
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,990
walk around
in the center as well and i was going to

692
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
in the center as well and i was going to
 

693
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,269
in the center as well and i was going to
do that in the shape of an

694
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
do that in the shape of an
 

695
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,829
do that in the shape of an
octagon so

696
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
octagon so
 

697
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,550
octagon so
at this distance here it feels about

698
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
at this distance here it feels about
 

699
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,870
at this distance here it feels about
right we have the whole thing in frame

700
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
right we have the whole thing in frame
 

701
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,550
right we have the whole thing in frame
and that is one two three four blocks so

702
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
and that is one two three four blocks so
 

703
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,629
and that is one two three four blocks so
we want our walkway

704
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
we want our walkway
 

705
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,310
we want our walkway
to be at least four blocks wide

706
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
to be at least four blocks wide
 

707
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,350
to be at least four blocks wide
so i'm just gonna cut this

708
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
so i'm just gonna cut this
 

709
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,790
so i'm just gonna cut this
out

710
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800

 

711
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,710

and we'll see how this goes

712
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720

 

713
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,790

i'm not i'm not the best at big builds i

714
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
i'm not i'm not the best at big builds i
 

715
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,829
i'm not i'm not the best at big builds i
haven't done

716
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
haven't done
 

717
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,870
haven't done
anything major in this game yet

718
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
anything major in this game yet
 

719
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,949
anything major in this game yet
um although recently i've been more

720
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
um although recently i've been more
 

721
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,710
um although recently i've been more
inspired to to attempt bigger projects

722
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
inspired to to attempt bigger projects
 

723
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,870
inspired to to attempt bigger projects
although this this really isn't a huge

724
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
although this this really isn't a huge
 

725
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,389
although this this really isn't a huge
build it's just

726
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
build it's just
 

727
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,790
build it's just
bigger than what i'm used to

728
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800

 

729
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,870

yeah if we did a straight across there i

730
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
yeah if we did a straight across there i
 

731
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,030
yeah if we did a straight across there i
think that diagonal would be too far

732
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
think that diagonal would be too far
 

733
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:01,509
think that diagonal would be too far
so let's go another block

734
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519

 

735
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,870

um how would that do

736
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
um how would that do
 

737
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,030
um how would that do
that is not good let's make this go one

738
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
that is not good let's make this go one
 

739
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,310
that is not good let's make this go one
more

740
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320

 

741
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:22,230

put this back

742
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
put this back
 

743
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,030
put this back
yeah that's that's about the size of the

744
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
yeah that's that's about the size of the
 

745
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,030
yeah that's that's about the size of the
octagon i'd want

746
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
octagon i'd want
 

747
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,670
octagon i'd want
so then this would be our path and we'll

748
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
so then this would be our path and we'll
 

749
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,069
so then this would be our path and we'll
have

750
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
have
 

751
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,350
have
a small staircase at each of these sides

752
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
a small staircase at each of these sides
 

753
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,790
a small staircase at each of these sides
to get up it

754
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
to get up it
 

755
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,509
to get up it
up the two block height let's pick this

756
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
up the two block height let's pick this
 

757
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,870
up the two block height let's pick this
up

758
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
up
 

759
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,870
up
it's working much better now now that i

760
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
it's working much better now now that i
 

761
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,910
it's working much better now now that i
did all that shaving today

762
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
did all that shaving today
 

763
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,710
did all that shaving today
go over here oh yeah uh but i still got

764
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720

a lot to do with that
so

768
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480

 

769
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,910

i'll i'll cut more of this out and i'll

770
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
i'll i'll cut more of this out and i'll
 

771
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,230
i'll i'll cut more of this out and i'll
get back to you

772
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240

 

773
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,590

yeah so what i've been doing now is i've

yeah so what i've been doing now is i've
 

775
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,669
yeah so what i've been doing now is i've
just been uh cutting out this octagon

776
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
just been uh cutting out this octagon
 

777
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,309
just been uh cutting out this octagon
shape

778
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
shape
 

779
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,110
shape
um just to see how it'll look when it's

780
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
um just to see how it'll look when it's
 

781
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,870
um just to see how it'll look when it's
all done and then we'll replace the

782
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
all done and then we'll replace the
 

783
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,789
all done and then we'll replace the
stone with wood or something else

784
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
stone with wood or something else
 

785
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,470
stone with wood or something else
a different material if it looks good

786
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
a different material if it looks good
 

787
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,669
a different material if it looks good
um last episode maybe i'll just touch on

788
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
um last episode maybe i'll just touch on
 

789
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,630
um last episode maybe i'll just touch on
this a bit

and we
 

797
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,309
and we
we didn't really figure out anything

uh i did not see anything
 

811
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,029
uh i did not see anything
definite though like out of all the

812
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
definite though like out of all the
 

813
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,029
definite though like out of all the
suggestions i didn't see anything like

814
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
suggestions i didn't see anything like
 

815
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,750
suggestions i didn't see anything like
yes that will work for sure and i didn't

816
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
yes that will work for sure and i didn't
 

817
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,190
yes that will work for sure and i didn't
come up with anything like that on my

818
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
come up with anything like that on my
 

819
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,590
come up with anything like that on my
own

820
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
own
 

821
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,669
own
either so i still don't know exactly

822
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
either so i still don't know exactly
 

823
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,390
either so i still don't know exactly
what i'm doing although

824
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
what i'm doing although
 

825
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,310
what i'm doing although
i did get some good suggestions which

826
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
i did get some good suggestions which
 

827
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,390
i did get some good suggestions which
i'll have to look into further

828
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
i'll have to look into further
 

829
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,830
i'll have to look into further
um so first of all with the idea of

830
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
um so first of all with the idea of
 

831
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,470
um so first of all with the idea of
using

832
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
using
 

833
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,070
using
their pathfinding to separate them using

834
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
their pathfinding to separate them using
 

835
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,590
their pathfinding to separate them using
villagers to get to separate zombies and

836
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
villagers to get to separate zombies and
 

837
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,029
villagers to get to separate zombies and
the ocelots to separate the creepers

838
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
the ocelots to separate the creepers
 

839
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,909
the ocelots to separate the creepers
there's a a definite problem with that

840
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
there's a a definite problem with that
 

841
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,990
there's a a definite problem with that
method

842
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
method
 

843
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,310
method
if like you need to give them at least

844
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
if like you need to give them at least
 

845
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,510
if like you need to give them at least
one block that they

846
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
one block that they
 

847
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,549
one block that they
will walk onto to get to the villager

848
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
will walk onto to get to the villager
 

849
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,669
will walk onto to get to the villager
for example

850
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
for example
 

851
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,750
for example
and if there's that one block there

852
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
and if there's that one block there
 

853
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,990
and if there's that one block there
there's a chance any other mob will also

854
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
there's a chance any other mob will also
 

855
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,270
there's a chance any other mob will also
go to that one block

856
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
go to that one block
 

857
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,310
go to that one block
so it you can't get it to 100 percent i

858
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
so it you can't get it to 100 percent i
 

859
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,710
so it you can't get it to 100 percent i
don't think there's any way

860
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
don't think there's any way
 

861
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,150
don't think there's any way
of making it work for sure properly

862
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
of making it work for sure properly
 

863
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,669
of making it work for sure properly
um then there's also captain walnut's

864
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
um then there's also captain walnut's
 

865
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,990
um then there's also captain walnut's
method of using snowmen

866
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
method of using snowmen
 

867
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,789
method of using snowmen
which does seem to work really well and

868
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
which does seem to work really well and
 

869
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,150
which does seem to work really well and
by the way there was a lot of confusion

870
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
by the way there was a lot of confusion
 

871
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,270
by the way there was a lot of confusion

is getting them you got to give them a
 

889
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,830
is getting them you got to give them a
target to shoot at right

890
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
target to shoot at right
 

891
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,710
target to shoot at right
uh the way i saw captain walnut had his

892
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
uh the way i saw captain walnut had his
 

893
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,390
uh the way i saw captain walnut had his
setup he was using

894
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
setup he was using
 

895
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,990
setup he was using
spiders which i do not have spawning

896
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
spiders which i do not have spawning
 

897
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,789
spiders which i do not have spawning
in my system at all spiders and endermen

898
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
in my system at all spiders and endermen
 

899
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,470
in my system at all spiders and endermen
don't spawn in there

900
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
don't spawn in there
 

901
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,870
don't spawn in there
so i need a different target i'll either

902
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
so i need a different target i'll either
 

903
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,150
so i need a different target i'll either
have to use

904
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
have to use
 

905
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,190
have to use
zombies creepers or

906
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
zombies creepers or
 

907
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,350
zombies creepers or
skeletons if i use that method

908
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
skeletons if i use that method
 

909
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,230
skeletons if i use that method
and that is a big problem because as far

910
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
and that is a big problem because as far
 

911
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,630
and that is a big problem because as far
as i know

912
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240

 

955
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,870

don't know what to do about that i saw

956
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
don't know what to do about that i saw
 

957
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,270
don't know what to do about that i saw
in

958
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
in
 

959
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,029
in
i don't know if like if captain walnut

960
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
i don't know if like if captain walnut
 

961
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,789
i don't know if like if captain walnut
had a trick to it i saw

962
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
had a trick to it i saw
 

963
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,750
had a trick to it i saw
he had like an iron fence maybe where

964
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
he had like an iron fence maybe where
 

965
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,190
he had like an iron fence maybe where
the snowman was but it was really hard

966
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
the snowman was but it was really hard
 

967
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,710
the snowman was but it was really hard
to see in the video

968
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
to see in the video
 

969
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,510
to see in the video
maybe he's using that as a way because

970
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
maybe he's using that as a way because
 

971
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,590
maybe he's using that as a way because
in his older system he was using zombies

972
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
in his older system he was using zombies
 

973
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,029
in his older system he was using zombies
as a target

974
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
as a target
 

975
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,430
as a target
but it to me it looked like he was just

976
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
but it to me it looked like he was just
 

977
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,590
but it to me it looked like he was just
placing the zombies using mob eggs

978
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
placing the zombies using mob eggs
 

979
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,549
placing the zombies using mob eggs
not that they were actually put there by

980
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
not that they were actually put there by
 

981
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,549
not that they were actually put there by
the system itself

982
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
the system itself
 

983
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,590
the system itself
but i could be wrong on that

984
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
but i could be wrong on that
 

985
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,669
but i could be wrong on that
anyway that's that's the concern about

986
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
anyway that's that's the concern about
 

987
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,710
anyway that's that's the concern about
the snowman method

988
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
the snowman method
 

989
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,710
the snowman method
another good idea that was suggested was

990
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
another good idea that was suggested was
 

991
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,310
another good idea that was suggested was
just to use

992
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
just to use
 

993
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,470
just to use
oh yeah and about the creeper thing the

994
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
oh yeah and about the creeper thing the
 

995
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,029
oh yeah and about the creeper thing the
creepers will only run away from

996
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
creepers will only run away from
 

997
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,190
creepers will only run away from
the ocelots if they have a lot of

998
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
the ocelots if they have a lot of
 

999
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,710
the ocelots if they have a lot of
possible places to run

1000
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,720
possible places to run
 

1001
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,870
possible places to run
to and if you give them a lot of

1002
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
to and if you give them a lot of
 

1003
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,870
to and if you give them a lot of
possible places to run to

1004
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
possible places to run to
 

1005
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,590
possible places to run to
there's a very very good chance a

1006
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
there's a very very good chance a
 

1007
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,350
there's a very very good chance a
skeleton or something will go that way

1008
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
skeleton or something will go that way
 

1009
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,310
skeleton or something will go that way
as well

1010
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
as well
 

1011
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,990
as well
because they have a lot of possible

1012
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
because they have a lot of possible
 

1013
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,990
because they have a lot of possible
chances of choosing that direction

1014
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000

 

1015
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,510

but another really good idea i got

1016
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
but another really good idea i got
 

1017
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,430
but another really good idea i got
suggested was that i

1018
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440

 

1019
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,350

um use iron golems to separate

1020
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
um use iron golems to separate
 

1021
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,230
um use iron golems to separate
skeletons from creepers and use

1022
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
skeletons from creepers and use
 

1023
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,789
skeletons from creepers and use
villagers to separate the zombies

1024
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
villagers to separate the zombies
 

1025
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,909
villagers to separate the zombies
it doesn't matter so much if a

1026
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
it doesn't matter so much if a
 

1027
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,070
it doesn't matter so much if a
if a skeleton or creeper gets mixed in

1028
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
if a skeleton or creeper gets mixed in
 

1029
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,750
if a skeleton or creeper gets mixed in
with the zombies for what i have planned

1030
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
with the zombies for what i have planned
 

1031
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,710
with the zombies for what i have planned
it won't cause any serious problems so

1032
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
it won't cause any serious problems so
 

1033
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,350
it won't cause any serious problems so
uh that could work i'll have to look

1034
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
uh that could work i'll have to look
 

1035
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,430
uh that could work i'll have to look
into that some more

1036
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
into that some more
 

1037
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,789
into that some more
and just the idea is to use the momentum

1038
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
and just the idea is to use the momentum
 

1039
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,350
and just the idea is to use the momentum
of the iron golem hitting the skeleton

1040
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
of the iron golem hitting the skeleton
 

1041
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,270
of the iron golem hitting the skeleton
to launch them into a separate stream

1042
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
to launch them into a separate stream
 

1043
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,950
to launch them into a separate stream
than the creepers so that's

1044
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
than the creepers so that's
 

1045
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,310
than the creepers so that's
that's the best idea i think out there

1046
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
that's the best idea i think out there
 

1047
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,990
that's the best idea i think out there
yet for what i want to do and that's

1048
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
yet for what i want to do and that's
 

1049
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,870
yet for what i want to do and that's
what i'm going to research some more and

1050
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
what i'm going to research some more and
 

1051
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,470
what i'm going to research some more and
probably use

1052
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
probably use
 

1053
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,310
probably use
unless i can figure out how to do the

1054
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
unless i can figure out how to do the
 

1055
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,270
unless i can figure out how to do the
snowman thing properly

1056
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
snowman thing properly
 

1057
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,110
snowman thing properly
anyway let's take a look at this how are

1058
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
anyway let's take a look at this how are
 

1059
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,090
anyway let's take a look at this how are
we looking

1060
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,100

 

1061
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,950

[Music]

1062
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960

 

1063
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,750

what do you guys think of the shape

1064
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760

 

1065
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,630

yeah i think that'll be okay uh how's it

1066
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
yeah i think that'll be okay uh how's it
 

1067
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,990
yeah i think that'll be okay uh how's it
gonna look from up higher

1068
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000

 

1069
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,909

so on these edges is where the the

1070
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
so on these edges is where the the
 

1071
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,350
so on these edges is where the the
chests are going to be all on the

1072
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
chests are going to be all on the
 

1073
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,310
chests are going to be all on the
outside

1074
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
outside
 

1075
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,990
outside
uh it's probably going to be several

1076
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
uh it's probably going to be several
 

1077
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,830
uh it's probably going to be several
layers as well not just like

1078
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
layers as well not just like
 

1079
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,710
layers as well not just like
at ground level here it's going to go up

1080
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
at ground level here it's going to go up
 

1081
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,350
at ground level here it's going to go up
vertically

1082
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
vertically
 

1083
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,110
vertically
a bit so we'll be looking down at this

1084
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
a bit so we'll be looking down at this
 

1085
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,669
a bit so we'll be looking down at this
as well

1086
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679

 

1087
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,029

yeah i think that's okay so

1088
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
yeah i think that's okay so
 

1089
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,990
yeah i think that's okay so
um maybe i'll try outline it with wood

1090
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
um maybe i'll try outline it with wood
 

1091
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,909
um maybe i'll try outline it with wood
and set up some stairs

1092
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
and set up some stairs
 

1093
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,350
and set up some stairs
and we'll see how it looks

1094
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
and we'll see how it looks
 

1095
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,870
and we'll see how it looks
hmm what to do what to do this is the

1096
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
hmm what to do what to do this is the
 

1097
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,470
hmm what to do what to do this is the
part of the build where i need to make a

1098
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
part of the build where i need to make a
 

1099
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,430
part of the build where i need to make a
lot of important decisions

1100
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
lot of important decisions
 

1101
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,990
lot of important decisions
and then stick with them be happy with

1102
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
and then stick with them be happy with
 

1103
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,390
and then stick with them be happy with
them because

1104
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
them because
 

1105
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,390
them because
they'll be tough to change later so

1106
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
they'll be tough to change later so
 

1107
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,110
they'll be tough to change later so
one thing i think will really bug me

1108
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
one thing i think will really bug me
 

1109
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,830
one thing i think will really bug me
with this if i keep it like this

1110
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
with this if i keep it like this
 

1111
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,029
with this if i keep it like this
with the two block thing is i can't see

1112
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
with the two block thing is i can't see
 

1113
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,909
with the two block thing is i can't see
the mob drops in the emp units which

1114
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
the mob drops in the emp units which
 

1115
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,310
the mob drops in the emp units which
would really suck so i should

1116
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
would really suck so i should
 

1117
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,110
would really suck so i should
at the very least raise this floor up

1118
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
at the very least raise this floor up
 

1119
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,269
at the very least raise this floor up
half a block

1120
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
half a block
 

1121
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,990
half a block
and then i would be able to see him

1122
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
and then i would be able to see him
 

1123
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,870
and then i would be able to see him
um if we go up another if we go up a

1124
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
um if we go up another if we go up a
 

1125
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,230
um if we go up another if we go up a
full block

1126
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
full block
 

1127
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,750
full block
might even be better although then the

1128
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
might even be better although then the
 

1129
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,230
might even be better although then the
center

1130
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
center
 

1131
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,470
center
isn't as highlighted so that's one thing

1132
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
isn't as highlighted so that's one thing
 

1133
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,669
isn't as highlighted so that's one thing
i'll probably do and uh i want you guys

1134
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
i'll probably do and uh i want you guys
 

1135
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,549
i'll probably do and uh i want you guys
feedback on all

1136
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
feedback on all
 

1137
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,070
feedback on all
on all of this so i'm going to bring up

1138
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
on all of this so i'm going to bring up
 

1139
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,590
on all of this so i'm going to bring up
a few things here

1140
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
a few things here
 

1141
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,950
a few things here
um the other thing we got to figure out

1142
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
um the other thing we got to figure out
 

1143
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,390
um the other thing we got to figure out
is what type of

1144
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
is what type of
 

1145
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,230
is what type of
blocks should we use with this build

1146
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
blocks should we use with this build
 

1147
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,390
blocks should we use with this build
a general trick i see among builders is

1148
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
a general trick i see among builders is
 

1149
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,750
a general trick i see among builders is
to keep

1150
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
to keep
 

1151
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,870
to keep
within two or three main type of blocks

1152
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
within two or three main type of blocks
 

1153
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,470
within two or three main type of blocks
in your builds otherwise it tends to get

1154
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
in your builds otherwise it tends to get
 

1155
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,669
in your builds otherwise it tends to get
over complicated looking or over

1156
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
over complicated looking or over
 

1157
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,710
over complicated looking or over
your eyes don't know what to focus on

1158
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
your eyes don't know what to focus on
 

1159
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,710
your eyes don't know what to focus on
if you don't use enough types it looks

1160
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
if you don't use enough types it looks
 

1161
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,990
if you don't use enough types it looks
really plain

1162
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
really plain
 

1163
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,630
really plain
so probably keep it down to three main

1164
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
so probably keep it down to three main
 

1165
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,750
so probably keep it down to three main
block types

1166
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
block types
 

1167
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,669
block types
or three main block colors or whatever

1168
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679

 

1169
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,950

i tend to prefer i guess you'd call them

1170
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960

um
that's a lot like what we did at the

1188
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
that's a lot like what we did at the
 

1189
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,750
that's a lot like what we did at the
other base though so if

1190
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
other base though so if
 

1191
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,110
other base though so if
if we went that path we we would be

1192
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
if we went that path we we would be
 

1193
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,830
if we went that path we we would be
getting into

1194

repeats here with my style most likely

1196
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
repeats here with my style most likely
 

1197
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,430
repeats here with my style most likely
which may or may not be a good thing

1198

1205
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,310

but if we do the same thing it might not

1206
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
but if we do the same thing it might not
 

1207
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,549
but if we do the same thing it might not
be very interesting to do it again you

be very interesting to do it again you
 

1209
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,549
be very interesting to do it again you
know

1210

another thing around here like if i use

1212
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
another thing around here like if i use
 

1213
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,390
another thing around here like if i use
grass this is the color we're gonna have

1214
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
grass this is the color we're gonna have
 

1215
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,110
grass this is the color we're gonna have
i'm okay with that color that looks good

1216

i'm okay with that color that looks good
but there's also

1218
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
but there's also
 

1219
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,230
but there's also
river biome here it's the same color

1220
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
river biome here it's the same color
 

1221
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,710
river biome here it's the same color
if we go over here we got swampland

1222
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
if we go over here we got swampland
 

1223
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,390
if we go over here we got swampland
though and i don't like swampland grass

1224
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
though and i don't like swampland grass
 

1225
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,750
though and i don't like swampland grass
you know in this game i've never really

1226
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
you know in this game i've never really
 

1227
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,590
you know in this game i've never really
been tempted to use a texture pack or

1228
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
been tempted to use a texture pack or
 

1229
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,350
been tempted to use a texture pack or
anything

1230
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
anything
 

1231
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,830
anything
except for maybe faithful the faithful

except for maybe faithful the faithful
texture pack

1234
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
texture pack
 

1235
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,549
texture pack
but the thing that has always really

1236
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
but the thing that has always really
 

1237
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,230
but the thing that has always really
tempted me is to change

1238
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
tempted me is to change
 

1239
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,590
tempted me is to change
my grass texture file

1240
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
my grass texture file
 

1241
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,710
my grass texture file
the grass colors because i do not like

1242
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
the grass colors because i do not like
 

1243
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,750
the grass colors because i do not like
how

1244
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
how
 

1245
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,590
how
most the grass in this game doesn't look

1246
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
most the grass in this game doesn't look
 

1247
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,990
most the grass in this game doesn't look
green they really needed to make it

1248
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
green they really needed to make it
 

1249
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,110
green they really needed to make it
like they should have done it like how

1250
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
like they should have done it like how
 

1251
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,630
like they should have done it like how
terraria does it with the different

1252
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
terraria does it with the different
 

1253
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,710
terraria does it with the different
grass seeds and you could

1254
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
grass seeds and you could
 

1255
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,230
grass seeds and you could
have different colors of grass and

1256
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
have different colors of grass and
 

1257
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,230
have different colors of grass and
difference in like

1258
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,240
difference in like
 

1259
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,789
difference in like
multiple biomes you know in my opinion

1260
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
multiple biomes you know in my opinion
 

1261
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,630
multiple biomes you know in my opinion
like instead of it being linked to the

1262
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
like instead of it being linked to the
 

1263
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,149
like instead of it being linked to the
biome code it should be

1264
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
biome code it should be
 

1265
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,830
biome code it should be
just different types of grass like like

1266
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
just different types of grass like like
 

1267
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,590
just different types of grass like like
how you can have mycelium

1268
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
how you can have mycelium
 

1269
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,510
how you can have mycelium
in different biomes that would have been

1270
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
in different biomes that would have been
 

1271
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,909
in different biomes that would have been
cool if they did that way instead that

1272
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
cool if they did that way instead that
 

1273
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,909
cool if they did that way instead that
way we could choose what grass we want

1274
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
way we could choose what grass we want
 

1275
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,430
way we could choose what grass we want
where

1276
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
where
 

1277
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,110
where
um but anyway

1278
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
um but anyway
 

1279
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,389
um but anyway
got to figure out what blocks we're

1280
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
got to figure out what blocks we're
 

1281
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,789
got to figure out what blocks we're
going to use got to figure out

1282
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
going to use got to figure out
 

1283
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,909
going to use got to figure out
uh what shape and how we're going to do

1284
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
uh what shape and how we're going to do
 

1285
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,830
uh what shape and how we're going to do
everything here so just

1286
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
everything here so just
 

1287
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,350
everything here so just
leave me your feedback i'll take you

1288
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
leave me your feedback i'll take you
 

1289
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,950
leave me your feedback i'll take you
into consideration

1290
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
into consideration
 

1291
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,789
into consideration
um what i was planning to do here

1292
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799

 

1293
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,110

uh do like a half slab staircase up to

1294
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
uh do like a half slab staircase up to
 

1295
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,110
uh do like a half slab staircase up to
the center

1296
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
the center
 

1297
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,990
the center
it won't be as big of a staircase if we

1298
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,000
it won't be as big of a staircase if we
 

1299
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,389
it won't be as big of a staircase if we
only go up one block or whatever

1300
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
only go up one block or whatever
 

1301
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,190
only go up one block or whatever
uh and then i was going to have wood

1302
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
uh and then i was going to have wood
 

1303
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,710
uh and then i was going to have wood
outlining it

1304
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:06,720

 

1305
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,830

with fences above above the logs here

1306
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
with fences above above the logs here
 

1307
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,630
with fences above above the logs here
um not necessarily this color like we

1308
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
um not necessarily this color like we
 

1309
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,310
um not necessarily this color like we
might use dark wood or

1310
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
might use dark wood or
 

1311
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,909
might use dark wood or
or something completely different

1312
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
or something completely different
 

1313
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,310
or something completely different
depending on what you guys see

1314
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
depending on what you guys see
 

1315
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,549
depending on what you guys see
but that was my idea originally

1316
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
but that was my idea originally
 

1317
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,750
but that was my idea originally
with this and then planks or something

1318
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
with this and then planks or something
 

1319
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,110
with this and then planks or something
for the floor here um

1320
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
for the floor here um
 

1321
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,029
for the floor here um
or actually if we do the grass thing it

1322
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
or actually if we do the grass thing it
 

1323
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,470
or actually if we do the grass thing it
would probably be grass

1324
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
would probably be grass
 

1325
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,430
would probably be grass
if we keep it like the other base over

1326
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
if we keep it like the other base over
 

1327
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,149
if we keep it like the other base over
here

1328
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
here
 

1329
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,029
here
