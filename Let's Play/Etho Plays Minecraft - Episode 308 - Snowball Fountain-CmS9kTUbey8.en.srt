back guys I got something to show you
I've been trying to figure out how to do

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,690
I've been trying to figure out how to do
 

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,840
I've been trying to figure out how to do
this for so long and I did it today I

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:17,850
this for so long and I did it today I
 

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,460
this for so long and I did it today I
saw it happen

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,470
saw it happen
 

13
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,000
saw it happen
it's a controlled case let's see if we

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,010
it's a controlled case let's see if we
 

15
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,519
it's a controlled case let's see if we
can figure this mystery out I'm sure

16
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:25,529
can figure this mystery out I'm sure
 

17
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,349
can figure this mystery out I'm sure
somebody's already explained how this

18
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
somebody's already explained how this
 

19
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,179
somebody's already explained how this
happens but I have no clue I haven't

20
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:29,189
happens but I have no clue I haven't
 

21
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,030
happens but I have no clue I haven't
found any information on this yet but

22
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,040
found any information on this yet but
 

23
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,229
found any information on this yet but
there's a portal glitch in the game

24
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,239
there's a portal glitch in the game
 

25
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,110
there's a portal glitch in the game
where if you break the portals in a

26
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,120
where if you break the portals in a
 

27
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,830
where if you break the portals in a
certain way somehow it just breaks some

28
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
certain way somehow it just breaks some
 

29
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,060
certain way somehow it just breaks some
of the portal blocks and not the whole

30
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,070
of the portal blocks and not the whole
 

31
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,389
of the portal blocks and not the whole
portal so we have a functioning portal

32
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
portal so we have a functioning portal
 

33
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,100
portal so we have a functioning portal
up here still I can make a 2x2 portal

34
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,110
up here still I can make a 2x2 portal
 

35
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,880
up here still I can make a 2x2 portal
from this which is pretty crazy let's

36
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:52,890
from this which is pretty crazy let's
 

37
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,750
from this which is pretty crazy let's
see if it still works still works very

38
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:56,760
see if it still works still works very
 

39
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,670
see if it still works still works very
good go back through and oh I just dig a

40
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
good go back through and oh I just dig a
 

41
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
good go back through and oh I just dig a
little bit of damage if I do that though

42
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,210
little bit of damage if I do that though
 

43
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,010
little bit of damage if I do that though
okay but I am gonna update this I want

44
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,020
okay but I am gonna update this I want
 

45
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,710
okay but I am gonna update this I want
to see if we can recreate this so

46
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:15,720
to see if we can recreate this so
 

47
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,090
to see if we can recreate this so
unfortunately even though I made it

48
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
unfortunately even though I made it
 

49
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,130
unfortunately even though I made it
happen here I'm gonna destroy it because

50
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,140
happen here I'm gonna destroy it because
 

51
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,440
happen here I'm gonna destroy it because
as soon as you update a block by it I

52
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,450
as soon as you update a block by it I
 

53
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,149
as soon as you update a block by it I
found it destroys it so there goes so

54
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
found it destroys it so there goes so
 

55
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,719
found it destroys it so there goes so
the way I made it though does it still

56
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:29,729
the way I made it though does it still
 

57
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,170
the way I made it though does it still
work I was in the middle of fixing this

58
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,180
work I was in the middle of fixing this
 

59
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,660
work I was in the middle of fixing this
portal and darn it I need fire let's go

60
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,670
portal and darn it I need fire let's go
 

61
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,350
portal and darn it I need fire let's go
get some fire real quick oh that was so

62
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,360
get some fire real quick oh that was so
 

63
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,539
get some fire real quick oh that was so
yeah I was I was gonna go work behind

64
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:50,549
yeah I was I was gonna go work behind
 

65
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,100
yeah I was I was gonna go work behind
the portal there on some stuff and I

66
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,110
the portal there on some stuff and I
 

67
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,020
the portal there on some stuff and I
pressed one of the buttons and it made

68
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,030
pressed one of the buttons and it made
 

69
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,200
pressed one of the buttons and it made
water come out and that caused that to

70
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,210
water come out and that caused that to
 

71
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,030
water come out and that caused that to
happen somehow I don't know if I can

72
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
happen somehow I don't know if I can
 

73
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
happen somehow I don't know if I can
replicate it or not but if we can we can

74
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:02,729
replicate it or not but if we can we can
 

75
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,180
replicate it or not but if we can we can
figure out how it happens probably so

76
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,190
figure out how it happens probably so
 

77
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,240
figure out how it happens probably so
let's hope we can replicate it here

78
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,250
let's hope we can replicate it here
 

79
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,300
let's hope we can replicate it here
all right so I'm gonna light it again

80
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,310
all right so I'm gonna light it again
 

81
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,740
all right so I'm gonna light it again
all I do is I press this button and it

82
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,750
all I do is I press this button and it
 

83
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,330
all I do is I press this button and it
happened now okay darn it so there is

84
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,340
happened now okay darn it so there is
 

85
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,630
happened now okay darn it so there is
some special situation where it happens

86
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,640
some special situation where it happens
 

87
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,500
some special situation where it happens
it's not just the layout there's some

88
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,510
it's not just the layout there's some
 

89
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,229
it's not just the layout there's some
reason it happens maybe if we go through

90
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
reason it happens maybe if we go through
 

91
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,250
reason it happens maybe if we go through
once and then come back through and I

92
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,260
once and then come back through and I
 

93
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,830
once and then come back through and I
think it happens when the portal is is

94
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:38,840
think it happens when the portal is is
 

95
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,360
think it happens when the portal is is
weird like this you see how this block

96
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,370
weird like this you see how this block
 

97
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:48,130
weird like this you see how this block
is different maybe let's see if that

98
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,140
is different maybe let's see if that
 

99
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,620
is different maybe let's see if that
glitched it now it still looks like a

100
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,630
glitched it now it still looks like a
 

101
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,160
glitched it now it still looks like a
proper portal okay so I guess we won't

102
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,170
proper portal okay so I guess we won't
 

103
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,500
proper portal okay so I guess we won't
figure it out today after all uh but

104
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,510
figure it out today after all uh but
 

105
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,470
figure it out today after all uh but
anyway I've gone ahead and I fixed that

106
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
anyway I've gone ahead and I fixed that
 

107
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,339
anyway I've gone ahead and I fixed that
portal so it does three things now let's

108
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:06,349
portal so it does three things now let's
 

109
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,319
portal so it does three things now let's
let's check this out well I did three

110
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,329
let's check this out well I did three
 

111
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,720
let's check this out well I did three
before but now they actually work so we

112
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:10,730
before but now they actually work so we
 

113
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,880
before but now they actually work so we
have you light it you can clear it and

114
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:14,890
have you light it you can clear it and
 

115
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,979
have you light it you can clear it and
the third super secrets wasn't placed

116
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:17,989
the third super secrets wasn't placed
 

117
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,479
the third super secrets wasn't placed
for a button so I had to hide its

118
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:19,489
for a button so I had to hide its
 

119
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,720
for a button so I had to hide its
function is do you throw a blocker or

120
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,730
function is do you throw a blocker or
 

121
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,940
function is do you throw a blocker or
anything over here it'll pick it up and

122
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:26,950
anything over here it'll pick it up and
 

123
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,319
anything over here it'll pick it up and
turns the portal on for just the right

124
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:29,329
turns the portal on for just the right
 

125
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,789
turns the portal on for just the right
amount of time to go through and then it

126
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
amount of time to go through and then it
 

127
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,319
amount of time to go through and then it
destroys it behind you so we can go

128
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,329
destroys it behind you so we can go
 

129
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,289
destroys it behind you so we can go
ahead and check this out back here I've

130
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:38,299
ahead and check this out back here I've
 

131
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,840
ahead and check this out back here I've
been doing a lot of like fixing fixing

132
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:40,850
been doing a lot of like fixing fixing
 

133
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,530
been doing a lot of like fixing fixing
things around here and finishing things

134
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:43,540
things around here and finishing things
 

135
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,520
things around here and finishing things
around the man team I think that's

136
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,530
around the man team I think that's
 

137
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,289
around the man team I think that's
really important otherwise I think I'll

138
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:47,299
really important otherwise I think I'll
 

139
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,099
really important otherwise I think I'll
become pretty unhappy with the way

140
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:51,109
become pretty unhappy with the way
 

141
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,449
become pretty unhappy with the way
things are because a lot of things were

142
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:52,459
things are because a lot of things were
 

143
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,440
things are because a lot of things were
breaking and it's never it's never like

144
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,450
breaking and it's never it's never like
 

145
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,809
breaking and it's never it's never like
satisfying when you when you're around

146
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:58,819
satisfying when you when you're around
 

147
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,550
satisfying when you when you're around
all this stuff all the time that's that

148
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
all this stuff all the time that's that
 

149
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,770
all this stuff all the time that's that
that you know is broken so to get it

150
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:02,780
that you know is broken so to get it
 

151
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,699
that you know is broken so to get it
working again it's awesome oh yeah

152
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:06,709
working again it's awesome oh yeah
 

153
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,199
working again it's awesome oh yeah
there's just there's a bunch of stuff

154
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,209
there's just there's a bunch of stuff
 

155
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,009
there's just there's a bunch of stuff
back here and then we wouldn't decide

156
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,019
back here and then we wouldn't decide
 

157
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,080
back here and then we wouldn't decide
what to put for the backing yet one idea

158
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,090
what to put for the backing yet one idea
 

159
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,819
what to put for the backing yet one idea
I had actually was maybe we should put

160
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:15,829
I had actually was maybe we should put
 

161
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:18,240
I had actually was maybe we should put
some some maps or something back here

162
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,250
some some maps or something back here
 

163
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,940
some some maps or something back here
because we can we can totally hide all

164
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:21,950
because we can we can totally hide all
 

165
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,710
because we can we can totally hide all
the blocks in the back there if we put

166
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:23,720
the blocks in the back there if we put
 

167
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,410
the blocks in the back there if we put
maps over top

168
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,420
maps over top
 

169
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,480
maps over top
and it might look pretty cool if we do

170
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,490
and it might look pretty cool if we do
 

171
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,140
and it might look pretty cool if we do
it right or even a custom nap but that

172
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,150
it right or even a custom nap but that
 

173
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,600
it right or even a custom nap but that
might be a pain to creates I don't know

174
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,610
might be a pain to creates I don't know
 

175
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,210
might be a pain to creates I don't know
but it still works if you do this so if

176
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,220
but it still works if you do this so if
 

177
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,740
but it still works if you do this so if
we go through now if we close it behind

178
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:40,750
we go through now if we close it behind
 

179
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,750
we go through now if we close it behind
us takes us to the nether hub but then

180
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:45,760
us takes us to the nether hub but then
 

181
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,050
us takes us to the nether hub but then
when we go back it will take us to the

182
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,060
when we go back it will take us to the
 

183
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,490
when we go back it will take us to the
snowflake like I originally intended so

184
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,500
snowflake like I originally intended so
 

185
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,000
snowflake like I originally intended so
we're up here on the snowflake honestly

186
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,010
we're up here on the snowflake honestly
 

187
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,070
we're up here on the snowflake honestly
I can't quite remember what my idea was

188
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,080
I can't quite remember what my idea was
 

189
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,120
I can't quite remember what my idea was
with the snowflake so I don't know what

190
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,130
with the snowflake so I don't know what
 

191
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,040
with the snowflake so I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with it and I don't

192
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,050
I'm supposed to do with it and I don't
 

193
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,630
I'm supposed to do with it and I don't
really have any ideas I think my plan

194
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:06,640
really have any ideas I think my plan
 

195
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,270
really have any ideas I think my plan
with this was just to have a cool high

196
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
with this was just to have a cool high
 

197
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,070
with this was just to have a cool high
up portal that you could jump down and

198
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,080
up portal that you could jump down and
 

199
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,540
up portal that you could jump down and
have fun jumping down or ender pearl a

200
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,550
have fun jumping down or ender pearl a
 

201
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,980
have fun jumping down or ender pearl a
long distance from here because you

202
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:16,990
long distance from here because you
 

203
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,780
long distance from here because you
gotta have the heights so if you ender

204
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:18,790
gotta have the heights so if you ender
 

205
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,820
gotta have the heights so if you ender
pearl the ender pearls go really really

206
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:20,830
pearl the ender pearls go really really
 

207
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:28,890
pearl the ender pearls go really really
far where did that take us yeah took us

208
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:28,900
far where did that take us yeah took us
 

209
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,370
far where did that take us yeah took us
quite a ways away and the thing is

210
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:32,380
quite a ways away and the thing is
 

211
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,600
quite a ways away and the thing is
though I also did that thing with my

212
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,610
though I also did that thing with my
 

213
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,430
though I also did that thing with my
spawn where I have the boats way up in

214
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
spawn where I have the boats way up in
 

215
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,810
spawn where I have the boats way up in
the sky there and I think that's a lot

216
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:36,820
the sky there and I think that's a lot
 

217
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,060
the sky there and I think that's a lot
more fun than if we were to do voting

218
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,070
more fun than if we were to do voting
 

219
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,970
more fun than if we were to do voting
off of this thing so not sure I'm gonna

220
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:41,980
off of this thing so not sure I'm gonna
 

221
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:49,140
off of this thing so not sure I'm gonna
make any adjustments to this it is fun

222
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,150
make any adjustments to this it is fun
 

223
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,490
make any adjustments to this it is fun

yikes gotta work on security out here I
started working on the entrance to this

236
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,100
started working on the entrance to this
 

237
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,860
started working on the entrance to this
I haven't gotten very far but I'm

238
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:10,870
I haven't gotten very far but I'm
 

239
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,020
I haven't gotten very far but I'm

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,030
considering putting like flowers and
 

241
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,080
considering putting like flowers and
stuff all along here you're making beds

242
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,090
stuff all along here you're making beds
 

243
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,200
stuff all along here you're making beds
like at different layers might be kind

244
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,210
like at different layers might be kind
 

245
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,520
like at different layers might be kind
of cool ooh look at this look at this

246
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,530
of cool ooh look at this look at this
 

247
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,470
of cool ooh look at this look at this
what it does to the camera though it

248
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:27,480
what it does to the camera though it
 

249
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,020
what it does to the camera though it
like your vision is really narrow then

250
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,030
like your vision is really narrow then
 

251
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,640
like your vision is really narrow then
when you go down it it makes it really

252
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:31,650
when you go down it it makes it really
 

253
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,280
when you go down it it makes it really
wide and then it goes back to narrow I

254
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,290
wide and then it goes back to narrow I
 

255
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,580
wide and then it goes back to narrow I
don't know if that's good or not it's

256
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,590
don't know if that's good or not it's
 

257
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,640
don't know if that's good or not it's
kind of cool though ah but then there's

258
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,650
kind of cool though ah but then there's
 

259
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,470
kind of cool though ah but then there's
another thing I was working on over here

260
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,480
another thing I was working on over here
 

261
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,050
another thing I was working on over here
let's go take a look

262
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,060

 

263
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,370

just after I worked on that portal I

264
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:49,380
just after I worked on that portal I
 

265
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,210
just after I worked on that portal I
worked on this I have put in a little

266
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,220
worked on this I have put in a little
 

267
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,310
worked on this I have put in a little
garden here which I really really liked

268
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,320
garden here which I really really liked
 

269
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,930
garden here which I really really liked
you actually it doesn't make a lot of

270
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:56,940
you actually it doesn't make a lot of
 

271
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,060
you actually it doesn't make a lot of
sense but I think it looks cool i

272
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,070
sense but I think it looks cool i
 

273
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,690
sense but I think it looks cool i
hollowed out the rocks here and just

274
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:02,700
hollowed out the rocks here and just
 

275
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,210
hollowed out the rocks here and just
planted a bunch of junk and put a lot of

276
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
planted a bunch of junk and put a lot of
 

277
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,390
planted a bunch of junk and put a lot of
green and some light sand and whatnot so

278
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400

 

279
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,620

yeah it doesn't make a lot of sense I

280
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:12,630
yeah it doesn't make a lot of sense I
 

281
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,300
yeah it doesn't make a lot of sense I
have these things in the front just to

282
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,310
have these things in the front just to
 

283
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,250
have these things in the front just to
give it some some more depth and also

284
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,260
give it some some more depth and also
 

285
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,500
give it some some more depth and also
make it look like it's somehow still

286
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,510
make it look like it's somehow still
 

287
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,650
make it look like it's somehow still
structurally intact I guess and then I'm

288
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:21,660
structurally intact I guess and then I'm
 

289
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,630
structurally intact I guess and then I'm
starting to make a path going out this

290
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:23,640
starting to make a path going out this
 

291
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,040
starting to make a path going out this
way this goes behind Wilson might have

292
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,050
way this goes behind Wilson might have
 

293
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,140
way this goes behind Wilson might have
like glass along here so we can look at

294
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,150
like glass along here so we can look at
 

295
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,200
like glass along here so we can look at
the wiring from from like a bridge or

296
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,210
the wiring from from like a bridge or
 

297
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,980
the wiring from from like a bridge or
something here would be cool Wilson's

298
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:36,990
something here would be cool Wilson's
 

299
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,820
something here would be cool Wilson's
right down there and maybe make a path

300
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:40,830
right down there and maybe make a path
 

301
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,050
right down there and maybe make a path
going this way that way a bridge will

302
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,060
going this way that way a bridge will
 

303
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,750
going this way that way a bridge will
like over top this area and another path

304
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:47,760
like over top this area and another path
 

305
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,450
like over top this area and another path
going down below it's kind of get that

306
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:50,460
going down below it's kind of get that
 

307
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,909
going down below it's kind of get that
crisscross feeling going I think would

308
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
crisscross feeling going I think would
 

309
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,150
crisscross feeling going I think would
be pretty cool but I do have a project I

310
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,160
be pretty cool but I do have a project I
 

311
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,800
be pretty cool but I do have a project I
want to do with you guys today so let's

312
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:00,810
want to do with you guys today so let's
 

313
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,750
want to do with you guys today so let's
see let's get started on that this

314
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:02,760
see let's get started on that this
 

315
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,390
see let's get started on that this
should be pretty cool if we can pull it

316
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
should be pretty cool if we can pull it
 

317
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,500
should be pretty cool if we can pull it
off I want to put in a fountain in this

318
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,510
off I want to put in a fountain in this
 

319
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,890
off I want to put in a fountain in this
pool of water here I want it to turn on

320
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:11,900
pool of water here I want it to turn on
 

321
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,810
pool of water here I want it to turn on
when we're by it I don't want it running

322
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:14,820
when we're by it I don't want it running
 

323
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,750
when we're by it I don't want it running
it for not by it and it's it's just to

324
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:17,760
it for not by it and it's it's just to
 

325
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,240
it for not by it and it's it's just to
be decorative and something fun to look

326
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,250
be decorative and something fun to look
 

327
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,390
be decorative and something fun to look
at sort of thing and we are not doing it

328
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,400
at sort of thing and we are not doing it
 

329
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,100
at sort of thing and we are not doing it
out of water we're making a snowball

330
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,110
out of water we're making a snowball
 

331
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,450
out of water we're making a snowball
fountain which I think it'll work out

332
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,460
fountain which I think it'll work out
 

333
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,149
fountain which I think it'll work out
okay we have this snow machine right

334
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
okay we have this snow machine right
 

335
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,579
okay we have this snow machine right
over here right

336
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:36,589

 

337
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,469

know that I was able to pick that up I

338
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
know that I was able to pick that up I
 

339
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,639
know that I was able to pick that up I
thought that might go in the hopper Kurt

340
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:39,649
thought that might go in the hopper Kurt
 

341
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,790
thought that might go in the hopper Kurt
ah you just get your shovel whale on the

342
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:45,800
ah you just get your shovel whale on the
 

343
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,170
ah you just get your shovel whale on the
snow for a little bit and you'll get

344
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,180
snow for a little bit and you'll get
 

345
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,389
snow for a little bit and you'll get
like tons and tons of snowballs doing

346
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:49,399
like tons and tons of snowballs doing
 

347
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,900
like tons and tons of snowballs doing
this pretty quickly this all funnels

348
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,910
this pretty quickly this all funnels
 

349
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,939
this pretty quickly this all funnels
down into a storage system that we set

350
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:54,949
down into a storage system that we set
 

351
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:59,819
down into a storage system that we set
up a long time ago father actually that

352
00:08:59,819 --> 00:08:59,829
up a long time ago father actually that
 

353
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,410
up a long time ago father actually that
empty really quick I can't remember how

354
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,420
empty really quick I can't remember how
 

355
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,999
empty really quick I can't remember how
I have this set up but I must've did

356
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,009
I have this set up but I must've did
 

357
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,809
I have this set up but I must've did
something fancy oh yeah we got a bunch

358
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:07,819
something fancy oh yeah we got a bunch
 

359
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,699
something fancy oh yeah we got a bunch
of storage chests down here and you can

360
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:09,709
of storage chests down here and you can
 

361
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,960
of storage chests down here and you can
see they're filling up little by little

362
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:12,970
see they're filling up little by little
 

363
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,400
see they're filling up little by little
so we got to take the snowballs from

364
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,410
so we got to take the snowballs from
 

365
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,030
so we got to take the snowballs from
here and we're gonna move them to some

366
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
here and we're gonna move them to some
 

367
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,939
here and we're gonna move them to some
dispensers hidden under the water here

368
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:21,949
dispensers hidden under the water here
 

369
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:27,189
dispensers hidden under the water here
is the plan I think we'll have to do two

370
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:27,199
is the plan I think we'll have to do two
 

371
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,769
is the plan I think we'll have to do two
fountains unfortunately I would just do

372
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:29,779
fountains unfortunately I would just do
 

373
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,809
fountains unfortunately I would just do
one except it's an even number so I

374
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:31,819
one except it's an even number so I
 

375
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,290
one except it's an even number so I
can't really center its which stinks

376
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,300
can't really center its which stinks
 

377
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,449
can't really center its which stinks
this is why you must always work with

378
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:37,459
this is why you must always work with
 

379
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,230
this is why you must always work with
Eva or with odd numbers it's just I

380
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
Eva or with odd numbers it's just I
 

381
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,730
Eva or with odd numbers it's just I
don't know if you ever do anything even

382
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:42,740
don't know if you ever do anything even
 

383
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,999
don't know if you ever do anything even
it seems like there's trouble eventually

384
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:45,009
it seems like there's trouble eventually
 

385
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,069
it seems like there's trouble eventually
so let's try to find out it's sort of

386
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:48,079
so let's try to find out it's sort of
 

387
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,369
so let's try to find out it's sort of
the middle if we're just putting two

388
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:51,379
the middle if we're just putting two
 

389
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,030
the middle if we're just putting two
dispensers I guess that would be maybe

390
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,040
dispensers I guess that would be maybe
 

391
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,949
dispensers I guess that would be maybe
see this is one two wait one two three

392
00:09:59,949 --> 00:09:59,959
see this is one two wait one two three
 

393
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,100
see this is one two wait one two three
four five the middle would be here maybe

394
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,110
four five the middle would be here maybe
 

395
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,059
four five the middle would be here maybe
let's put a forward one block and we'll

396
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:10,069
let's put a forward one block and we'll
 

397
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:14,049
let's put a forward one block and we'll
stick one right here go down another

398
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:14,059
stick one right here go down another
 

399
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:16,420
stick one right here go down another
block so we can hide a hopper underneath

400
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,430
block so we can hide a hopper underneath
 

401
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,819
block so we can hide a hopper underneath
the ground or something going into the

402
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:18,829
the ground or something going into the
 

403
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,199
the ground or something going into the
dispenser then we'll put another one

404
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:20,209
dispenser then we'll put another one
 

405
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,939
dispenser then we'll put another one
over here and hopefully this works out

406
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:24,949
over here and hopefully this works out
 

407
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:30,129
over here and hopefully this works out
okay all right let's just see if that's

408
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,139
okay all right let's just see if that's
 

409
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,919
okay all right let's just see if that's
centered or not it's not centered we

410
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:32,929
centered or not it's not centered we
 

411
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,489
centered or not it's not centered we
can't really Center it perfectly but

412
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:35,499
can't really Center it perfectly but
 

413
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,660
can't really Center it perfectly but
yeah that should be fine that that's

414
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:37,670
yeah that should be fine that that's
 

415
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,079
yeah that should be fine that that's
kind of the middle this way and it's

416
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:41,089
kind of the middle this way and it's
 

417
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,439
kind of the middle this way and it's
centered nicely this way I guess I don't

418
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:44,449
centered nicely this way I guess I don't
 

419
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:45,059
centered nicely this way I guess I don't
know

420
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:45,069
know
 

421
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,919
know
so now we're gonna have to set up a

422
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:47,929
so now we're gonna have to set up a
 

423
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,780
so now we're gonna have to set up a
minecart system to move these

424
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:49,790
minecart system to move these
 

425
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,300
minecart system to move these
snow balls over there so I'm gonna dig

426
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,310
snow balls over there so I'm gonna dig
 

427
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,040
snow balls over there so I'm gonna dig
some tunnels and see if we can make her

428
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,050
some tunnels and see if we can make her
 

429
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,250
some tunnels and see if we can make her
way from there to there and connect them

430
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,260
way from there to there and connect them
 

431
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,020
way from there to there and connect them
together hmm okay this is gonna be a

432
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,030
together hmm okay this is gonna be a
 

433
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,910
together hmm okay this is gonna be a
little tough to do we don't have a lot

434
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
little tough to do we don't have a lot
 

435
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,280
little tough to do we don't have a lot
of space to work with I haven't I

436
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,290
of space to work with I haven't I
 

437
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,510
of space to work with I haven't I
haven't found the shortest path yet

438
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,520
haven't found the shortest path yet
 

439
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,700
haven't found the shortest path yet
either the best path but I did find an

440
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:09,710
either the best path but I did find an
 

441
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,630
either the best path but I did find an
easy way in just over here so these are

442
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:13,640
easy way in just over here so these are
 

443
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,360
easy way in just over here so these are
the dispensers the water is right above

444
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,370
the dispensers the water is right above
 

445
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,290
the dispensers the water is right above
that's the problem

446
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,300
that's the problem
 

447
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,490
that's the problem
oh I didn't make I lost a bunch of my

448
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:21,500
oh I didn't make I lost a bunch of my
 

449
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,680
oh I didn't make I lost a bunch of my
redstone stuff like I I must have put it

450
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:23,690
redstone stuff like I I must have put it
 

451
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,110
redstone stuff like I I must have put it
somewhere I have no idea where it all

452
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,120
somewhere I have no idea where it all
 

453
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,600
somewhere I have no idea where it all
ran off to so I'm remaking everything

454
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,610
ran off to so I'm remaking everything
 

455
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,040
ran off to so I'm remaking everything
pretty much now it's um dropper is going

456
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,050
pretty much now it's um dropper is going
 

457
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,240
pretty much now it's um dropper is going
so we gotta get snow balls to that one

458
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,250
so we gotta get snow balls to that one
 

459
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,760
so we gotta get snow balls to that one
and that one from a minecart and make it

460
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:36,770
and that one from a minecart and make it
 

461
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,760
and that one from a minecart and make it
all automatic and the problem is usually

462
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:39,770
all automatic and the problem is usually
 

463
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,880
all automatic and the problem is usually
hoppers when you're dealing with hoppers

464
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:42,890
hoppers when you're dealing with hoppers
 

465
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,780
hoppers when you're dealing with hoppers
stuff goes downward like we're gonna try

466
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:46,790
stuff goes downward like we're gonna try
 

467
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,030
stuff goes downward like we're gonna try
fill it chests with snowballs I think a

468
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
fill it chests with snowballs I think a
 

469
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,670
fill it chests with snowballs I think a
double chest between these two and we

470
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:54,680
double chest between these two and we
 

471
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,250
double chest between these two and we
will put maybe a hopper here to fill it

472
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,260
will put maybe a hopper here to fill it
 

473
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,070
will put maybe a hopper here to fill it
and then how do we get from from the

474
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,080
and then how do we get from from the
 

475
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
and then how do we get from from the
chest to these and we need this one

476
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,330
chest to these and we need this one
 

477
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,120
chest to these and we need this one
block above it otherwise like if you

478
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,130
block above it otherwise like if you
 

479
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,680
block above it otherwise like if you
have a block above it you can't open the

480
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:11,690
have a block above it you can't open the
 

481
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,380
have a block above it you can't open the
chest and stuff from the hopper can't go

482
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,390
chest and stuff from the hopper can't go
 

483
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,400
chest and stuff from the hopper can't go
into it alright so don't have a lot of

484
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,410
into it alright so don't have a lot of
 

485
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,920
into it alright so don't have a lot of
space to work with here but I think if

486
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:20,930
space to work with here but I think if
 

487
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,120
space to work with here but I think if
we just put in a few extra Stoppers we

488
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,130
we just put in a few extra Stoppers we
 

489
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:32,230
we just put in a few extra Stoppers we
can make this work OOP oh man come on no

490
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
can make this work OOP oh man come on no
 

491
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,630
can make this work OOP oh man come on no
I don't think I can do it it's not gonna

492
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:34,640
I don't think I can do it it's not gonna
 

493
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,930
I don't think I can do it it's not gonna
let me can't do it in a jump

494
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:36,940
let me can't do it in a jump
 

495
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,210
let me can't do it in a jump
nope darn I really don't want to break

496
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,220
nope darn I really don't want to break
 

497
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,180
nope darn I really don't want to break
that ceiling okay but the idea is we

498
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,190
that ceiling okay but the idea is we
 

499
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,340
that ceiling okay but the idea is we
might be able to make it work if we if

500
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,350
might be able to make it work if we if
 

501
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,030
might be able to make it work if we if
we do it like this gets get these going

502
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
we do it like this gets get these going
 

503
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,260
we do it like this gets get these going
like this and break that that's fine

504
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,270
like this and break that that's fine
 

505
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,510
like this and break that that's fine
all right and then do that on the other

506
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:03,520
all right and then do that on the other
 

507
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,460
all right and then do that on the other
side and then if we send a redstone

508
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:08,470
side and then if we send a redstone
 

509
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,400
side and then if we send a redstone
pulse here I think a single pulse will

510
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,410
pulse here I think a single pulse will
 

511
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,670
pulse here I think a single pulse will
make make it'll activate a dropper here

512
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
make make it'll activate a dropper here
 

513
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,560
make make it'll activate a dropper here
one there and the dispenser up here all

514
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,570
one there and the dispenser up here all
 

515
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,800
one there and the dispenser up here all
in that one shot so if I can get a

516
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:24,810
in that one shot so if I can get a
 

517
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,990
in that one shot so if I can get a
dropper there we're gonna have to do it

518
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
dropper there we're gonna have to do it
 

519
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,579
dropper there we're gonna have to do it
the hard way I'd yes and yeah we'll take

520
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:32,589
the hard way I'd yes and yeah we'll take
 

521
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,350
the hard way I'd yes and yeah we'll take
that out it's just safe to remove Oh Oh

522
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
that out it's just safe to remove Oh Oh
 

523
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
that out it's just safe to remove Oh Oh
careful careful

524
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,490
careful careful
 

525
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,870
careful careful
better block it this is not easy doing

526
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:45,880
better block it this is not easy doing
 

527
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,840
better block it this is not easy doing
redstone around water it's the worst

528
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:48,850
redstone around water it's the worst
 

529
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:57,590
redstone around water it's the worst
thing in the world all right that'll do

530
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600

 

531
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,540

okay so we almost got it all set up here

532
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,550
okay so we almost got it all set up here
 

533
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,880
okay so we almost got it all set up here
I put in a temporary lever here just so

534
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,890
I put in a temporary lever here just so
 

535
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,590
I put in a temporary lever here just so
we'll be able to watch it from from up

536
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:04,600
we'll be able to watch it from from up
 

537
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,980
we'll be able to watch it from from up
here

538
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:04,990
here
 

539
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,300
here
I made this go down this goes to a clock

540
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,310
I made this go down this goes to a clock
 

541
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:17,910
I made this go down this goes to a clock
and into these stop I hope it doesn't

542
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
and into these stop I hope it doesn't
 

543
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,130
and into these stop I hope it doesn't
make that noise I think if I put a few

544
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,140
make that noise I think if I put a few
 

545
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,819
make that noise I think if I put a few
snowballs in beforehand it won't because

546
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:23,829
snowballs in beforehand it won't because
 

547
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,829
snowballs in beforehand it won't because
that dropper noise that dropper noise is

548
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
that dropper noise that dropper noise is
 

549
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,590
that dropper noise that dropper noise is
so annoying okay so these go to these

550
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
so annoying okay so these go to these
 

551
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,990
so annoying okay so these go to these
these hoppers from the chest this is the

552
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
these hoppers from the chest this is the
 

553
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,780
these hoppers from the chest this is the
main storage chest for the snowballs we

554
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:36,790
main storage chest for the snowballs we
 

555
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,780
main storage chest for the snowballs we
fill that from here send a storage

556
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:39,790
fill that from here send a storage
 

557
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,930
fill that from here send a storage
minecart over top and I have a automatic

558
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:42,940
minecart over top and I have a automatic
 

559
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,230
minecart over top and I have a automatic
unloading thing set up right now so

560
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,240
unloading thing set up right now so
 

561
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,329
unloading thing set up right now so
comparator goes to this redstone torch

562
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:48,339
comparator goes to this redstone torch
 

563
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,720
comparator goes to this redstone torch
and that goes up to this wire which

564
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:51,730
and that goes up to this wire which
 

565
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,139
and that goes up to this wire which
powers the power rail so when a cart

566
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:55,149
powers the power rail so when a cart
 

567
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,210
powers the power rail so when a cart
arrives and stuff starts going through

568
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,220
arrives and stuff starts going through
 

569
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,060
arrives and stuff starts going through
this hopper this goes off until the cart

570
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,070
this hopper this goes off until the cart
 

571
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,610
this hopper this goes off until the cart
is fully unloaded so it'll wait there

572
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:02,620
is fully unloaded so it'll wait there
 

573
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,490
is fully unloaded so it'll wait there
too it'll stop and wait until it's

574
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:05,500
too it'll stop and wait until it's
 

575
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,410
too it'll stop and wait until it's
totally unloaded before it goes back for

576
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:07,420
totally unloaded before it goes back for
 

577
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,160
totally unloaded before it goes back for
more snowballs which is what we want and

578
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,170
more snowballs which is what we want and
 

579
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,990
more snowballs which is what we want and
then we're gonna make this come down

580
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,000
then we're gonna make this come down
 

581
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,329
then we're gonna make this come down
to the pickup line it's really not that

582
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,339
to the pickup line it's really not that
 

583
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,689
to the pickup line it's really not that
far I had to make more power rails to

584
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:20,699
far I had to make more power rails to
 

585
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:21,920
far I had to make more power rails to
you because I don't know where my power

586
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:21,930
you because I don't know where my power
 

587
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,309
you because I don't know where my power
rails ran off to you losing all kinds of

588
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:25,319
rails ran off to you losing all kinds of
 

589
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:30,309
rails ran off to you losing all kinds of
things actually let's do it like this

590
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:30,319
things actually let's do it like this
 

591
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,999
things actually let's do it like this
okay cool so we will have power rails

592
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:35,009
okay cool so we will have power rails
 

593
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,699
okay cool so we will have power rails
here for sure

594
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:37,709
here for sure
 

595
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,800
here for sure
get some tracks go in and both our rails

596
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:42,810
get some tracks go in and both our rails
 

597
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,939
get some tracks go in and both our rails
all the way up here there and we can

598
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:46,949
all the way up here there and we can
 

599
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:49,579
all the way up here there and we can
just power this well let's do that for

600
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:49,589
just power this well let's do that for
 

601
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,050
just power this well let's do that for
now so the carts the store charts gonna

602
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,060
now so the carts the store charts gonna
 

603
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,809
now so the carts the store charts gonna
come here

604
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:55,819
come here
 

605
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:59,179
come here
and we got to make it know when to take

606
00:15:59,179 --> 00:15:59,189
and we got to make it know when to take
 

607
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:04,389
and we got to make it know when to take
off I guess let's see how do we do that

608
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
off I guess let's see how do we do that
 

609
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,540
off I guess let's see how do we do that
I've done this before but is it not

610
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:08,550
I've done this before but is it not
 

611
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,829
I've done this before but is it not
loading oh yeah it is loading you how do

612
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:12,839
loading oh yeah it is loading you how do
 

613
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,840
loading oh yeah it is loading you how do
we make you take off I can't I think of

614
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:14,850
we make you take off I can't I think of
 

615
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,499
we make you take off I can't I think of
how to do that right now

616
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:17,509
how to do that right now
 

617
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:24,439
how to do that right now
hmm I think we can just a second here I

618
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:24,449
hmm I think we can just a second here I
 

619
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,119
hmm I think we can just a second here I
think we can put a comparator next is

620
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:26,129
think we can put a comparator next is
 

621
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:29,329
think we can put a comparator next is
cart I'm sure I came up with a good way

622
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:29,339
cart I'm sure I came up with a good way
 

623
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,069
cart I'm sure I came up with a good way
of doing this before or there's there's

624
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:31,079
of doing this before or there's there's
 

625
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,389
of doing this before or there's there's
probably an easy way of doing this I

626
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
probably an easy way of doing this I
 

627
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,759
probably an easy way of doing this I
just need to stop and think of it for a

628
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:34,769
just need to stop and think of it for a
 

629
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,400
just need to stop and think of it for a
sec does this not power it oh yeah that

630
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,410
sec does this not power it oh yeah that
 

631
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,110
sec does this not power it oh yeah that
has to be a detector rail for it to do

632
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
has to be a detector rail for it to do
 

633
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,910
has to be a detector rail for it to do
that

634
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920

 

635
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,759

okay so I went into a greater world to

636
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:49,769
okay so I went into a greater world to
 

637
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,220
okay so I went into a greater world to
try to work out a solution I don't think

638
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,230
try to work out a solution I don't think
 

639
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,320
try to work out a solution I don't think
there's really like a super good one or

640
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,330
there's really like a super good one or
 

641
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,910
there's really like a super good one or
at least I don't know a super good way

642
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
at least I don't know a super good way
 

643
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,310
at least I don't know a super good way
of telling what a minecart is full

644
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
of telling what a minecart is full
 

645
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,350
of telling what a minecart is full
I could put a detector rail here with

646
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,360
I could put a detector rail here with
 

647
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,230
I could put a detector rail here with
the comparator next to it and I could

648
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,240
the comparator next to it and I could
 

649
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,510
the comparator next to it and I could
figure out when mine carts fold that way

650
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
figure out when mine carts fold that way
 

651
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,780
figure out when mine carts fold that way
but if there's a detector rail by this

652
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:08,790
but if there's a detector rail by this
 

653
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,760
but if there's a detector rail by this
hopper it's gonna power the hopper and

654
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:10,770
hopper it's gonna power the hopper and
 

655
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,740
hopper it's gonna power the hopper and
that'll prevent it from sending items to

656
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:12,750
that'll prevent it from sending items to
 

657
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,189
that'll prevent it from sending items to
the minecarts so there's that and yeah

658
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
the minecarts so there's that and yeah
 

659
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,510
the minecarts so there's that and yeah
so I decided to go with a timer so when

660
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
so I decided to go with a timer so when
 

661
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,340
so I decided to go with a timer so when
the cart goes over this detector rail

662
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:25,350
the cart goes over this detector rail
 

663
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,990
the cart goes over this detector rail
it's gonna activate a hopper timer down

664
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
it's gonna activate a hopper timer down
 

665
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,760
it's gonna activate a hopper timer down
below and I don't know how long it needs

666
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:31,770
below and I don't know how long it needs
 

667
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,010
below and I don't know how long it needs
to run for is this coming back it come

668
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,020
to run for is this coming back it come
 

669
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,200
to run for is this coming back it come
on oh good timing yeah very good timing

670
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,210
on oh good timing yeah very good timing
 

671
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,700
on oh good timing yeah very good timing
all right that emptied accidentally oh

672
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:42,710
all right that emptied accidentally oh
 

673
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,659
all right that emptied accidentally oh
yeah okay that's a problem so why did it

674
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:49,669

 

675
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:55,760

didn't work at all why is this powered

676
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:55,770
didn't work at all why is this powered
 

677
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,640
didn't work at all why is this powered
that's not supposed to be powered

678
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,650

 

679
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:07,960

wait a second Oh Oh the comparator is

680
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:07,970
wait a second Oh Oh the comparator is
 

681
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,090
wait a second Oh Oh the comparator is
powering this okay one second we could

682
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,100
powering this okay one second we could
 

683
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,950
powering this okay one second we could
probably fix this real quick just by

684
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
probably fix this real quick just by
 

685
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,130
probably fix this real quick just by
moving the detector rail over one doo

686
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,140
moving the detector rail over one doo
 

687
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,940
moving the detector rail over one doo
doo doo

688
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:21,950
doo doo
 

689
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:29,350
doo doo
Oh minecarts redstone so much fun move

690
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
Oh minecarts redstone so much fun move
 

691
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,470
Oh minecarts redstone so much fun move
okay we just about got it here just

692
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
okay we just about got it here just
 

693
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,940
okay we just about got it here just
about I think and we'll make this a

694
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,950
about I think and we'll make this a
 

695
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:46,110
about I think and we'll make this a
repeater so that power can't go this way

696
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,120

 

697
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,350

do this and this and that should do it

698
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,360

 

699
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,300

yeah okay it stopped good click it

700
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,310
yeah okay it stopped good click it
 

701
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,690
yeah okay it stopped good click it
yeah it's filling so this is a hopper

702
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:01,700
yeah it's filling so this is a hopper
 

703
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,580
yeah it's filling so this is a hopper
timer it is like a it doesn't run all

704
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,590
timer it is like a it doesn't run all
 

705
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,990
timer it is like a it doesn't run all
the time though this is a special

706
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
the time though this is a special
 

707
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,750
the time though this is a special
version where this is a regular piston

708
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:10,760
version where this is a regular piston
 

709
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,630
version where this is a regular piston
and this is a sticky piston normally in

710
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:13,640
and this is a sticky piston normally in
 

711
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,430
and this is a sticky piston normally in
a hopper timer I have a sticky piston on

712
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
a hopper timer I have a sticky piston on
 

713
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,710
a hopper timer I have a sticky piston on
both sides if you just do it on the one

714
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:17,720
both sides if you just do it on the one
 

715
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,330
both sides if you just do it on the one
side when you when you power it here

716
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:21,340
side when you when you power it here
 

717
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,650
side when you when you power it here
it'll go and it'll come back and then

718
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:23,660
it'll go and it'll come back and then
 

719
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,020
it'll go and it'll come back and then
it'll stop and that's it so that's kind

720
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,030
it'll stop and that's it so that's kind
 

721
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,800
it'll stop and that's it so that's kind
of cool so next thing is just to figure

722
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:29,810
of cool so next thing is just to figure
 

723
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,720
of cool so next thing is just to figure
out the timing looks like it needs to be

724
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,730
out the timing looks like it needs to be
 

725
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,330
out the timing looks like it needs to be
a bit longer and we will get that going

726
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,340
a bit longer and we will get that going
 

727
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,650
a bit longer and we will get that going
and then we can go check out the

728
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:38,660
and then we can go check out the
 

729
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,070
and then we can go check out the
snowball fountain so let's go do that

730
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080

 

731
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,780

all right everybody ready

732
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:46,790
all right everybody ready
 

733
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,570
all right everybody ready
this is snowball fountain tick number

734
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:49,580
this is snowball fountain tick number
 

735
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,890
this is snowball fountain tick number
one here we go whoa wait a minute I

736
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:56,900
one here we go whoa wait a minute I
 

737
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
one here we go whoa wait a minute I
think I disconnected this that's right I

738
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:58,610
think I disconnected this that's right I
 

739
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,660
think I disconnected this that's right I
remember now because it was annoying me

740
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:01,670
remember now because it was annoying me
 

741
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:09,019
remember now because it was annoying me
oh oh oh oh we're missing it

742
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:09,029

 

743
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:16,789

oh yeah I like it I like it a lot

744
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
oh yeah I like it I like it a lot
 

745
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,669
oh yeah I like it I like it a lot
okay so here's another thing we can do

746
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
okay so here's another thing we can do
 

747
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,699
okay so here's another thing we can do
with it though let's do a couple of

748
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:22,709
with it though let's do a couple of
 

749
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,859
with it though let's do a couple of
these going if we want them to shoot

750
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:24,869
these going if we want them to shoot
 

751
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:28,599
these going if we want them to shoot
higher we got to get make it less water

752
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:28,609
higher we got to get make it less water
 

753
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:31,189
higher we got to get make it less water
above the dispenser right now it's three

754
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:31,199
above the dispenser right now it's three
 

755
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:34,849
above the dispenser right now it's three
three blocks of water above we put this

756
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:34,859
three blocks of water above we put this
 

757
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,959
three blocks of water above we put this
here I'll make it two might even want to

758
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:38,969
here I'll make it two might even want to
 

759
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,359
here I'll make it two might even want to
try to make it one but we'll see how two

760
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:41,369
try to make it one but we'll see how two
 

761
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:50,179
try to make it one but we'll see how two
is okay there we go tape number 200 well

762
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:50,189
is okay there we go tape number 200 well
 

763
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:52,189
is okay there we go tape number 200 well
we had one super-high snowball oh yeah

764
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:52,199
we had one super-high snowball oh yeah
 

765
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:59,199
we had one super-high snowball oh yeah
they're hitting the bridge now oh yeah

766
00:20:59,199 --> 00:20:59,209

 

767
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:04,899

that is pretty sweet

768
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:04,909

 

769
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:09,379

okay let's see how that dwindled down

770
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:09,389
okay let's see how that dwindled down
 

771
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,449
okay let's see how that dwindled down
our supplies that next thing is we're

772
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:11,459
our supplies that next thing is we're
 

773
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:14,079
our supplies that next thing is we're
gonna have to get this so it's

774
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:14,089
gonna have to get this so it's
 

775
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,299
gonna have to get this so it's
proximity-based like when I'm near it

776
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:17,309
proximity-based like when I'm near it
 

777
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,859
proximity-based like when I'm near it
only otherwise we're gonna blow through

778
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:18,869
only otherwise we're gonna blow through
 

779
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:24,609
only otherwise we're gonna blow through
my stash of snowballs very quickly okay

780
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:24,619
my stash of snowballs very quickly okay
 

781
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,109
my stash of snowballs very quickly okay
not too bad I think it took out the top

782
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:27,119
not too bad I think it took out the top
 

783
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,519
not too bad I think it took out the top
two rows of this chest and we left it

784
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:31,529
two rows of this chest and we left it
 

785
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,009
two rows of this chest and we left it
running for quite a while there these

786
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:34,019
running for quite a while there these
 

787
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:39,409
running for quite a while there these
are all full yet okay that's doable and

788
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:39,419
are all full yet okay that's doable and
 

789
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,849
are all full yet okay that's doable and
this will run automatically the main

790
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:40,859
this will run automatically the main
 

791
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:41,989
this will run automatically the main
thing is we'll just have to go to the

792
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:41,999
thing is we'll just have to go to the
 

793
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,489
thing is we'll just have to go to the
snow snow machine up there and and

794
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:45,499
snow snow machine up there and and
 

795
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:51,619
snow snow machine up there and and
refill it every so often but there's I

796
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:51,629
refill it every so often but there's I
 

797
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,989
refill it every so often but there's I
think three double chests at least of

798
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:53,999
think three double chests at least of
 

799
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,509
think three double chests at least of
storage so it should last for quite a

800
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:56,519
storage so it should last for quite a
 

801
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,699
storage so it should last for quite a
while let's go see it one more time then

802
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:01,709
while let's go see it one more time then
 

803
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,979
while let's go see it one more time then
I'll try figure out some way of setting

804
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:03,989
I'll try figure out some way of setting
 

805
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,289
I'll try figure out some way of setting
up a player sensor to it

806
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:08,299

 

807
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,430

how does that look from up here

808
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440

 

809
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,240

I like that a lot that is really cool I

810
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,250
I like that a lot that is really cool I
 

811
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,470
I like that a lot that is really cool I
love the splashing sound you hear the

812
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
love the splashing sound you hear the
 

813
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,450
love the splashing sound you hear the
splashing sound let's crank this up what

814
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:23,460
splashing sound let's crank this up what
 

815
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,740
splashing sound let's crank this up what
would that be under let's just turn them

816
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:24,750
would that be under let's just turn them
 

817
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,280
would that be under let's just turn them
all up

818
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,290
all up
 

819
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,740
all up
probably ambient in an environment that

820
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:27,750
probably ambient in an environment that
 

821
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:37,370
probably ambient in an environment that
would guess oh yes no ball fountain I

822
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,380
would guess oh yes no ball fountain I
 

823
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,090
would guess oh yes no ball fountain I
love it

824
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,100
love it
 

825
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,150
love it
another cool idea maybe not here but

826
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,160
another cool idea maybe not here but
 

827
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,430
another cool idea maybe not here but
maybe some other time we'll put arrows

828
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,440
maybe some other time we'll put arrows
 

829
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,150
maybe some other time we'll put arrows
and lava above and have like a fire

830
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,160
and lava above and have like a fire
 

831
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,830
and lava above and have like a fire
arrow fountain or something somewhere

832
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
arrow fountain or something somewhere
 

833
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,620
arrow fountain or something somewhere
I'd be cool okay so just doing some

834
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:57,630
I'd be cool okay so just doing some
 

835
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,120
I'd be cool okay so just doing some
finishing touches on the snow ball

836
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,130
finishing touches on the snow ball
 

837
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,280
finishing touches on the snow ball
fountain I'm trying to put in the

838
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,290
fountain I'm trying to put in the
 

839
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,770
fountain I'm trying to put in the
proximity sensor to it so this is all

840
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:03,780
proximity sensor to it so this is all
 

841
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,910
proximity sensor to it so this is all
full now

842
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:04,920
full now
 

843
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,860
full now
I heard it's did a bunch of snowballs

844
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:06,870
I heard it's did a bunch of snowballs
 

845
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,350
I heard it's did a bunch of snowballs
and we got more ready and waiting to go

846
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
and we got more ready and waiting to go
 

847
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,470
and we got more ready and waiting to go
so when this is all full by the way this

848
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
so when this is all full by the way this
 

849
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,360
so when this is all full by the way this
just sits here and waits that's what I

850
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,370
just sits here and waits that's what I
 

851
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,790
just sits here and waits that's what I
want it to do because there's no point

852
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:16,800
want it to do because there's no point
 

853
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,030
want it to do because there's no point
for it to move if if it still has

854
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,040
for it to move if if it still has
 

855
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,050
for it to move if if it still has
snowballs and I got a redstone thing

856
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,060
snowballs and I got a redstone thing
 

857
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,180
snowballs and I got a redstone thing
going up here might need to lower this

858
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,190
going up here might need to lower this
 

859
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,630
going up here might need to lower this
some more but we'll see how this goes

860
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
some more but we'll see how this goes
 

861
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,710
some more but we'll see how this goes
then we will connect we'll put a

862
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
then we will connect we'll put a
 

863
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,950
then we will connect we'll put a
repeater here I think but before we do

864
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
repeater here I think but before we do
 

865
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
repeater here I think but before we do
that I don't always snow balls well over

866
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,490
that I don't always snow balls well over
 

867
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,540
that I don't always snow balls well over
down here this is again a hopper timer

868
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:41,550
down here this is again a hopper timer
 

869
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,150
down here this is again a hopper timer
where we have a regular piston on one

870
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,160
where we have a regular piston on one
 

871
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,340
where we have a regular piston on one
and a sticky one here which means it's

872
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,350
and a sticky one here which means it's
 

873
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,520
and a sticky one here which means it's
like a one time activated timer instead

874
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,530
like a one time activated timer instead
 

875
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,420
like a one time activated timer instead
of always running so we're gonna get a

876
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,430
of always running so we're gonna get a
 

877
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,810
of always running so we're gonna get a
snow golem right here and he's gonna try

878
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:56,820
snow golem right here and he's gonna try
 

879
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,860
snow golem right here and he's gonna try
I guess we need glass block here he's

880
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:00,870
I guess we need glass block here he's
 

881
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,120
I guess we need glass block here he's
gonna try to walk towards this pressure

882
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,130
gonna try to walk towards this pressure
 

883
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,540
gonna try to walk towards this pressure
plate when we're nearby before within 32

884
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:05,550
plate when we're nearby before within 32
 

885
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,630
plate when we're nearby before within 32
blocks of him he'll do that that goes to

886
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
blocks of him he'll do that that goes to
 

887
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,710
blocks of him he'll do that that goes to
here activates the timer if he keeps

888
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
here activates the timer if he keeps
 

889
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
here activates the timer if he keeps
pressing on this it doesn't matter it's

890
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,250
pressing on this it doesn't matter it's
 

891
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,610
pressing on this it doesn't matter it's
still going so while this is activated

892
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:16,620
still going so while this is activated
 

893
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,410
still going so while this is activated
the fountains are gonna be running and

894
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:18,420
the fountains are gonna be running and
 

895
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,440
the fountains are gonna be running and
now it's it's in a cool-down state

896
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,450

 

897
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,640

so this should help to conserve the

898
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:26,650
so this should help to conserve the
 

899
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,620
so this should help to conserve the
snowballs and only make it go when we

900
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,630
snowballs and only make it go when we
 

901
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,150
snowballs and only make it go when we
want it to and not all the time so the

902
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,160
want it to and not all the time so the
 

903
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,070
want it to and not all the time so the
last thing to do let's get our snow

904
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,080
last thing to do let's get our snow
 

905
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,590
last thing to do let's get our snow
golem in here I used a cow last time I

906
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
golem in here I used a cow last time I
 

907
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,060
golem in here I used a cow last time I
think it's snow golems gonna work out

908
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,070
think it's snow golems gonna work out
 

909
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,420
think it's snow golems gonna work out
better as long as he doesn't escape all

910
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,430
better as long as he doesn't escape all
 

911
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:52,070
better as long as he doesn't escape all
right there you go and he's gonna wanna

912
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
right there you go and he's gonna wanna
 

913
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,080
right there you go and he's gonna wanna
move if we give him a place to go so

914
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,090
move if we give him a place to go so
 

915
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,930
move if we give him a place to go so
let's open that up the cow did a steep

916
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:57,940
let's open that up the cow did a steep
 

917
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,550
let's open that up the cow did a steep
on my last sensor which has me a little

918
00:24:59,550 --> 00:24:59,560
on my last sensor which has me a little
 

919
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,240
on my last sensor which has me a little
worried if this guy gets free he's gonna

920
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,250
worried if this guy gets free he's gonna
 

921
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,510
worried if this guy gets free he's gonna
make a big mess which I don't really

922
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:06,520
make a big mess which I don't really
 

923
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:14,810
make a big mess which I don't really
want all right so I guess let's do it

924
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:14,820
want all right so I guess let's do it
 

925
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,290
want all right so I guess let's do it
get it going

926
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,300
get it going
 

927
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,050
get it going
there we go and head on up and all see

928
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,060
there we go and head on up and all see
 

929
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,230
there we go and head on up and all see
how it works

930
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
how it works
 

931
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,930
how it works
I know my way around here all right here

932
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:30,940
I know my way around here all right here
 

933
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,670
I know my way around here all right here
going that might this might be a problem

934
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:35,680
going that might this might be a problem
 

935
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,220
going that might this might be a problem
though for if we build lower down and

936
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,230
though for if we build lower down and
 

937
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,470
though for if we build lower down and
we're always down in the cave yeah this

938
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:43,480
we're always down in the cave yeah this
 

939
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,230
we're always down in the cave yeah this
is Wilson is Wilson no not even close

940
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
is Wilson is Wilson no not even close
 

941
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,940
is Wilson is Wilson no not even close
all right here we are so I'm gonna go up

942
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:53,950
all right here we are so I'm gonna go up
 

943
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,260
all right here we are so I'm gonna go up
here and see if it activates oh yeah it

944
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,270
here and see if it activates oh yeah it
 

945
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:04,080
here and see if it activates oh yeah it
is going woohoo might need to lower it I

946
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,090
is going woohoo might need to lower it I
 

947
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,680
is going woohoo might need to lower it I
don't know or put a randomizer so it

948
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:07,690
don't know or put a randomizer so it
