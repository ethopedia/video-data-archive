00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,290
our episode as you guys know my favorite
thing to do in this game is to come up

478
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
thing to do in this game is to come up
 

479
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,780
thing to do in this game is to come up
with ideas and then just see if I can

480
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:47,790
with ideas and then just see if I can
 

481
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,829
with ideas and then just see if I can
make those ideas happen

482
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:48,839
make those ideas happen
 

483
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,340
make those ideas happen
I love the whole design aspect of this

484
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,350
I love the whole design aspect of this
 

485
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,990
I love the whole design aspect of this
game I love coming up with new redstone

486
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
game I love coming up with new redstone
 

487
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,840
game I love coming up with new redstone
contraptions that sort of thing so today

488
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:56,850
contraptions that sort of thing so today
 

489
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,490
contraptions that sort of thing so today
that's exactly what we're doing we're

490
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:58,500
that's exactly what we're doing we're
 

491
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,670
that's exactly what we're doing we're
gonna try make a new redstone device

492
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,680
gonna try make a new redstone device
 

493
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,470
gonna try make a new redstone device
it's a technical challenge might not

494
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:03,480
it's a technical challenge might not
 

495
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,900
it's a technical challenge might not
necessarily be super practical for me

496
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:05,910
necessarily be super practical for me
 

497
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,720
necessarily be super practical for me
because I have two brewing systems

498
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:08,730
because I have two brewing systems
 

499
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,390
because I have two brewing systems
already but I really want to build this

500
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,400
already but I really want to build this
 

501
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,720
already but I really want to build this
thing so I'm going to you can't stop me

502
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:13,730
thing so I'm going to you can't stop me
 

503
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,800
thing so I'm going to you can't stop me
if you're playing on a server though

504
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:15,810
if you're playing on a server though
 

505
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,420
if you're playing on a server though
guys you might find this useful for your

506
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:17,430
guys you might find this useful for your
 

507
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,970
guys you might find this useful for your
nether hubs is where I think would be

508
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:19,980
nether hubs is where I think would be
 

509
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,610
nether hubs is where I think would be
most useful and I'll probably put in my

510
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,620
most useful and I'll probably put in my
 

511
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,070
most useful and I'll probably put in my
another up here too I am of course

512
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,080
another up here too I am of course
 

513
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,530
another up here too I am of course
talking about another brewing system

514
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:27,540
talking about another brewing system
 

515
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,530
talking about another brewing system
what do you guys think if I asked you to

516
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:30,540
what do you guys think if I asked you to
 

517
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,480
what do you guys think if I asked you to
build a brewing system that works in

518
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,490
build a brewing system that works in
 

519
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,610
build a brewing system that works in
another do you think you could do it do

520
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:34,620
another do you think you could do it do
 

521
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,070
another do you think you could do it do
you know how you would do it I've been

522
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,080
you know how you would do it I've been
 

523
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,060
you know how you would do it I've been
thinking about this for a little while

524
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,070
thinking about this for a little while
 

525
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,540
thinking about this for a little while
if it's really possible and I think I

526
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,550
if it's really possible and I think I
 

527
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,699
if it's really possible and I think I
have a pretty good idea of how to do it

528
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:43,709
have a pretty good idea of how to do it
 

529
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,670
have a pretty good idea of how to do it
now so here's the challenge of course if

530
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:46,680
now so here's the challenge of course if
 

531
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,530
now so here's the challenge of course if
you're in the nether and you place a

532
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:48,540
you're in the nether and you place a
 

533
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,170
you're in the nether and you place a
water buckets

534
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,180
water buckets
 

535
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,750
water buckets
it's gone so how do you fill up your

536
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
it's gone so how do you fill up your
 

537
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,570
it's gone so how do you fill up your
water bottles this has played everybody

538
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:56,580
water bottles this has played everybody
 

539
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,010
water bottles this has played everybody
that's tried to make another brewing

540
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,020
that's tried to make another brewing
 

541
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,040
that's tried to make another brewing
system it's impossible no it's not of

542
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,050
system it's impossible no it's not of
 

543
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,590
system it's impossible no it's not of
course as a lot of you know if you have

544
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
course as a lot of you know if you have
 

545
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,440
course as a lot of you know if you have
cauldrons in the nether you can fill

546
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,450
cauldrons in the nether you can fill
 

547
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,820
cauldrons in the nether you can fill
them with water

548
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:07,830
them with water
 

549
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,670
them with water
ah right so now if you have glass

550
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:10,680
ah right so now if you have glass
 

551
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,350
ah right so now if you have glass
bottles you can fill these from the

552
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,360
bottles you can fill these from the
 

553
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,340
bottles you can fill these from the
cauldron that's that's really cool right

554
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,350
cauldron that's that's really cool right
 

555
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,829
cauldron that's that's really cool right
seems pretty impractical etho why don't

556
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
seems pretty impractical etho why don't
 

557
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,480
seems pretty impractical etho why don't
you just build it in the overworld well

558
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,490
you just build it in the overworld well
 

559
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,540
you just build it in the overworld well
we're trying to a challenge right how do

560
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:23,550
we're trying to a challenge right how do
 

561
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,920
we're trying to a challenge right how do
you do it in the nether what's the best

562
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:24,930
you do it in the nether what's the best
 

563
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,360
you do it in the nether what's the best
way well there is one game mechanic

564
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,370
way well there is one game mechanic
 

565
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,940
way well there is one game mechanic
that's not super well known that we're

566
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:31,950
that's not super well known that we're
 

567
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,980
that's not super well known that we're
going to use as our main feature of this

568
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:33,990
going to use as our main feature of this
 

569
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,060
going to use as our main feature of this
brewing system all right so if you cart

570
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,070
brewing system all right so if you cart
 

571
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,560
brewing system all right so if you cart
water into the nether you can do it one

572
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,570
water into the nether you can do it one
 

573
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,590
water into the nether you can do it one
bucket at a time which we'll try to make

574
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:42,600
bucket at a time which we'll try to make
 

575
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,090
bucket at a time which we'll try to make
work with the system as well but you

576
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,100
work with the system as well but you
 

577
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,790
work with the system as well but you
also have another option a more

578
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
also have another option a more
 

579
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,780
also have another option a more
complicated option you could bring wet

580
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:50,790
complicated option you could bring wet
 

581
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,569
complicated option you could bring wet
sponges you those stack up to 64 so a

582
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:53,579
sponges you those stack up to 64 so a
 

583
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,540
sponges you those stack up to 64 so a
stack is wet sponges is like 64 water

584
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:56,550
stack is wet sponges is like 64 water
 

585
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,680
stack is wet sponges is like 64 water
budgets right did you know a lot of

586
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:00,690
budgets right did you know a lot of
 

587
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,340
budgets right did you know a lot of
people don't know this but if you if you

588
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,350
people don't know this but if you if you
 

589
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,190
people don't know this but if you if you
cook a sponge it dries it out but if you

590
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,200
cook a sponge it dries it out but if you
 

591
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,980
cook a sponge it dries it out but if you
also put an empty empty budget in the

592
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:09,990
also put an empty empty budget in the
 

593
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,650
also put an empty empty budget in the
bottom here watch what happens

594
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:14,660
bottom here watch what happens
 

595
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,850
bottom here watch what happens
dah dah

596
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:16,860
dah dah
 

597
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,920
dah dah
it fills it with water so we can get

598
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:18,930
it fills it with water so we can get
 

599
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,710
it fills it with water so we can get
water budgets in the nether now let's

600
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:21,720
water budgets in the nether now let's
 

601
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,760
water budgets in the nether now let's
build an automated system of doing this

602
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:24,770
build an automated system of doing this
 

603
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,600
build an automated system of doing this
okay guys so we're going to try to

604
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:26,610
okay guys so we're going to try to
 

605
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,100
okay guys so we're going to try to
figure this out together I haven't like

606
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,110
figure this out together I haven't like
 

607
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,840
figure this out together I haven't like
pre-designed this in creative or

608
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:29,850
pre-designed this in creative or
 

609
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,400
pre-designed this in creative or
anything I'm figuring this out with you

610
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,410
anything I'm figuring this out with you
 

611
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,639
anything I'm figuring this out with you
as we go and hopefully this is going to

612
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:34,649
as we go and hopefully this is going to
 

613
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,160
as we go and hopefully this is going to
work in the end of things I decided

614
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,170
work in the end of things I decided
 

615
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,660
work in the end of things I decided
let's build it in the overworld though

616
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:38,670
let's build it in the overworld though
 

617
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,949
let's build it in the overworld though
so we don't have to listen to the gas

618
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:39,959
so we don't have to listen to the gas
 

619
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,079
so we don't have to listen to the gas
the whole episode and because we got

620
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,089
the whole episode and because we got
 

621
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,110
the whole episode and because we got
better lighting more space figured it'd

622
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
better lighting more space figured it'd
 

623
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,290
better lighting more space figured it'd
be nicer so we have three main parts to

624
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:48,300
be nicer so we have three main parts to
 

625
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,819
be nicer so we have three main parts to
the project we got to figure out how to

626
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:49,829
the project we got to figure out how to
 

627
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,860
the project we got to figure out how to
get the water out of the sponges in a

628
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,870
get the water out of the sponges in a
 

629
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,750
get the water out of the sponges in a
nice way we got to figure out how to

630
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
nice way we got to figure out how to
 

631
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,490
nice way we got to figure out how to
fill up the water bottles and then we

632
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:55,500
fill up the water bottles and then we
 

633
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,650
fill up the water bottles and then we
got to make a brewing system which could

634
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:57,660
got to make a brewing system which could
 

635
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,510
got to make a brewing system which could
be anything you know there's lots of

636
00:14:59,510 --> 00:14:59,520
be anything you know there's lots of
 

637
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,790
be anything you know there's lots of
different designs for those so we'll

638
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
different designs for those so we'll
 

639
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,250
different designs for those so we'll
focus on the first two parts mainly um

640
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,260
focus on the first two parts mainly um
 

641
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,280
focus on the first two parts mainly um
so fuel goes in from the side right yeah

642
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,290
so fuel goes in from the side right yeah
 

643
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,949
so fuel goes in from the side right yeah
so that goes there

644
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
so that goes there
 

645
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,750
so that goes there
can we put water can't put full water

646
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,760
can we put water can't put full water
 

647
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,540
can we put water can't put full water
buckets and we put empty ones yes that's

648
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,550
buckets and we put empty ones yes that's
 

649
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,180
buckets and we put empty ones yes that's
what I've thought okay good so those

650
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,190
what I've thought okay good so those
 

651
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,620
what I've thought okay good so those
instantly got pulled out

652
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,630
instantly got pulled out
 

653
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,090
instantly got pulled out
that's interesting because the planks

654
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,100
that's interesting because the planks
 

655
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,920
that's interesting because the planks
didn't do that right the fuel stays

656
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:24,930
didn't do that right the fuel stays
 

657
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:35,300
didn't do that right the fuel stays
inside but the budgets don't hmm what

658
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,310
inside but the budgets don't hmm what
 

659
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,640
inside but the budgets don't hmm what
happens we should test this actually

660
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:37,650
happens we should test this actually
 

661
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,530
happens we should test this actually
what happens when it fills up with water

662
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:41,540
what happens when it fills up with water
 

663
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,790
what happens when it fills up with water
can we can we make that happen we're

664
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:43,800
can we can we make that happen we're
 

665
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,080
can we can we make that happen we're
gonna have to power this hopper down

666
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,090
gonna have to power this hopper down
 

667
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,350
gonna have to power this hopper down
here and then let's just put that in for

668
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,360
here and then let's just put that in for
 

669
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,460
here and then let's just put that in for
right now when we unpowered this is it

670
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,470
right now when we unpowered this is it
 

671
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,570
right now when we unpowered this is it
going to pull the water bucket out

672
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:53,580
going to pull the water bucket out
 

673
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,160
going to pull the water bucket out
because it's not pulling the fuel out

674
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,170
because it's not pulling the fuel out
 

675
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,690
because it's not pulling the fuel out
okay it does take the water backed it

676
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:56,700
okay it does take the water backed it
 

677
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,820
okay it does take the water backed it
out that's really important otherwise

678
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:58,830
out that's really important otherwise
 

679
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,720
out that's really important otherwise
this ideas is busted right okay so we're

680
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:02,730
this ideas is busted right okay so we're
 

681
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,920
this ideas is busted right okay so we're
gonna have to keep this locked while the

682
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:05,930
gonna have to keep this locked while the
 

683
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,750
gonna have to keep this locked while the
empty bucket is in there but then pull

684
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:08,760
empty bucket is in there but then pull
 

685
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,180
empty bucket is in there but then pull
the full one out so unlock the hopper

686
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,190
the full one out so unlock the hopper
 

687
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,010
the full one out so unlock the hopper
once it fills it up ah-ha so check it

688
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,020
once it fills it up ah-ha so check it
 

689
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,810
once it fills it up ah-ha so check it
out guys I got an idea for a trick here

690
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:17,820
out guys I got an idea for a trick here
 

691
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,350
out guys I got an idea for a trick here
ah a furnace has three inventory spots

692
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
ah a furnace has three inventory spots
 

693
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,750
ah a furnace has three inventory spots
right so if one of them is full this

694
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:23,760
right so if one of them is full this
 

695
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,450
right so if one of them is full this
comparator outputs a redstone signal of

696
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:26,460
comparator outputs a redstone signal of
 

697
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,420
comparator outputs a redstone signal of
five distance right so up to five blocks

698
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,430
five distance right so up to five blocks
 

699
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,670
five distance right so up to five blocks
away if this one was full it would be

700
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
away if this one was full it would be
 

701
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
away if this one was full it would be
ten blocks if all three were full it

702
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:33,690
ten blocks if all three were full it
 

703
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,710
ten blocks if all three were full it
would be fifteen that this would output

704
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
would be fifteen that this would output
 

705
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,620
would be fifteen that this would output
a signal so there's a cool little trick

706
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:39,630
a signal so there's a cool little trick
 

707
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:45,650
a signal so there's a cool little trick
here if we if we if we do that and we

708
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:45,660
here if we if we if we do that and we
 

709
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,150
here if we if we if we do that and we
put our empty bucket in right now this

710
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
put our empty bucket in right now this
 

711
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,580
put our empty bucket in right now this
hopper is locked by the redstone here

712
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:49,590
hopper is locked by the redstone here
 

713
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,590
hopper is locked by the redstone here
right look what the comparator does goes

714
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
right look what the comparator does goes
 

715
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,630
right look what the comparator does goes
way out when it turns into a water

716
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:56,640
way out when it turns into a water
 

717
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
way out when it turns into a water
bucket which unlocks the hopper and

718
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:58,650
bucket which unlocks the hopper and
 

719
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,100
bucket which unlocks the hopper and
allows it to pass through so because

720
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,110
allows it to pass through so because
 

721
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,320
allows it to pass through so because
empty buckets only they stack up to

722
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,330
empty buckets only they stack up to
 

723
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,319
empty buckets only they stack up to
sixteen per stack water buckets only

724
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,329
sixteen per stack water buckets only
 

725
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,030
sixteen per stack water buckets only
stack up to one so they output a signal

726
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,040
stack up to one so they output a signal
 

727
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
stack up to one so they output a signal
way farther than empty buckets so that's

728
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,010
way farther than empty buckets so that's
 

729
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,250
way farther than empty buckets so that's
how we know when to pull the bucket

730
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,260
how we know when to pull the bucket
 

731
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,429
how we know when to pull the bucket
through oh man I think this is gonna be

732
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
through oh man I think this is gonna be
 

733
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,720
through oh man I think this is gonna be
a really cool machine

734
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:17,730
a really cool machine
 

735
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,910
a really cool machine
when it's all done guys so I got a

736
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:19,920
when it's all done guys so I got a
 

737
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,079
when it's all done guys so I got a
little carried away I started watching

738
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,089
little carried away I started watching
 

739
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,819
little carried away I started watching
some YouTube videos and I should include

740
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:22,829
some YouTube videos and I should include
 

741
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,160
some YouTube videos and I should include
you sooner but I'll just run you through

742
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,170
you sooner but I'll just run you through
 

743
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,220
you sooner but I'll just run you through
what we got here now so this is our wet

744
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,230
what we got here now so this is our wet
 

745
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,420
what we got here now so this is our wet
sponge to water bucket machine and it's

746
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,430
sponge to water bucket machine and it's
 

747
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,370
sponge to water bucket machine and it's
like fully automatic fits in a four by

748
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,380
like fully automatic fits in a four by
 

749
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,300
like fully automatic fits in a four by
four area I'm

750
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,310
four area I'm
 

751
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,610
four area I'm
really happy with it actually I'm really

752
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:37,620
really happy with it actually I'm really
 

753
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,980
really happy with it actually I'm really
happy with how this turned out so the

754
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:39,990
happy with how this turned out so the
 

755
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,300
happy with how this turned out so the
way this would work

756
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,310
way this would work
 

757
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,100
way this would work
you'd probably drop off a stack of wet

758
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,110
you'd probably drop off a stack of wet
 

759
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,290
you'd probably drop off a stack of wet
sponges in here let's just do four to

760
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,300
sponges in here let's just do four to
 

761
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,570
sponges in here let's just do four to
begin with though once you do that you

762
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,580
begin with though once you do that you
 

763
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,820
begin with though once you do that you
press a button and then it does its

764
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:49,830
press a button and then it does its
 

765
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,670
press a button and then it does its
thing here so what happens is this is a

766
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:52,680
thing here so what happens is this is a
 

767
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,830
thing here so what happens is this is a
dropper facing down into the furnace

768
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:54,840
dropper facing down into the furnace
 

769
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
dropper facing down into the furnace
that puts the wet sponge just one of

770
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,210
that puts the wet sponge just one of
 

771
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,830
that puts the wet sponge just one of
them in the inventory there and you see

772
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:00,840
them in the inventory there and you see
 

773
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,830
them in the inventory there and you see
what happened it put two sticks in and

774
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:02,840
what happened it put two sticks in and
 

775
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,010
what happened it put two sticks in and
then the empty bucket comes after that

776
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,020
then the empty bucket comes after that
 

777
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,900
then the empty bucket comes after that
once it turns into water but yet the

778
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:08,910
once it turns into water but yet the
 

779
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,690
once it turns into water but yet the
hopper has to unlock below to allow it

780
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:11,700
hopper has to unlock below to allow it
 

781
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,260
hopper has to unlock below to allow it
to pass through there's a lot going on

782
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,270
to pass through there's a lot going on
 

783
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,150
to pass through there's a lot going on
in such a little space honestly it's

784
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,160
in such a little space honestly it's
 

785
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,430
in such a little space honestly it's
pretty cool but yeah the the dry sponges

786
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
pretty cool but yeah the the dry sponges
 

787
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,050
pretty cool but yeah the the dry sponges
and the water budgets passed through

788
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,060
and the water budgets passed through
 

789
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,630
and the water budgets passed through
this hopper we got like a little item

790
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
this hopper we got like a little item
 

791
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,390
this hopper we got like a little item
filter thing here so wet budgets can't

792
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
filter thing here so wet budgets can't
 

793
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,310
filter thing here so wet budgets can't
go in this hopper only dry sponges and

794
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,320
go in this hopper only dry sponges and
 

795
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,750
go in this hopper only dry sponges and
then the wet yeah I say wet budgets I

796
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:34,760
then the wet yeah I say wet budgets I
 

797
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,270
then the wet yeah I say wet budgets I
guess they are wet but yeah the water

798
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,280
guess they are wet but yeah the water
 

799
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,160
guess they are wet but yeah the water
budgets they keep on going they fill up

800
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,170
budgets they keep on going they fill up
 

801
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,820
budgets they keep on going they fill up
this chest right so that's that's the

802
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:43,830
this chest right so that's that's the
 

803
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,790
this chest right so that's that's the
general concept of it on the side here

804
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:46,800
general concept of it on the side here
 

805
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,420
general concept of it on the side here
we have three three more droppers facing

806
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,430
we have three three more droppers facing
 

807
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,970
we have three three more droppers facing
into these hoppers so the ordering is

808
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:52,980
into these hoppers so the ordering is
 

809
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,680
into these hoppers so the ordering is
really important we can't just fill up

810
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:54,690
really important we can't just fill up
 

811
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,870
really important we can't just fill up
this furnace with fuel because if we do

812
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
this furnace with fuel because if we do
 

813
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,760
this furnace with fuel because if we do
that then we can't put the empty buckets

814
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,770
that then we can't put the empty buckets
 

815
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,880
that then we can't put the empty buckets
inside we need to just have exactly

816
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:01,890
inside we need to just have exactly
 

817
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,360
inside we need to just have exactly
enough fuel to do one operation and it

818
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,370
enough fuel to do one operation and it
 

819
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,730
enough fuel to do one operation and it
just so happens two sticks does that if

820
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:07,740
just so happens two sticks does that if
 

821
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,250
just so happens two sticks does that if
we were to use planks what would happen

822
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,260
we were to use planks what would happen
 

823
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,010
we were to use planks what would happen
is each plank can do one one-and-a-half

824
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,020
is each plank can do one one-and-a-half
 

825
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,160
is each plank can do one one-and-a-half
operations so eventually they'll get to

826
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,170
operations so eventually they'll get to
 

827
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,900
operations so eventually they'll get to
the point where it doesn't need to burn

828
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:17,910
the point where it doesn't need to burn
 

829
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,330
the point where it doesn't need to burn
a plank and then a plank will get stuck

830
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:20,340
a plank and then a plank will get stuck
 

831
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,970
a plank and then a plank will get stuck
in here and then the whole thing freezes

832
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:22,980
in here and then the whole thing freezes
 

833
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,170
in here and then the whole thing freezes
but with two sticks it's perfect so what

834
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,180
but with two sticks it's perfect so what
 

835
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,940
but with two sticks it's perfect so what
we do we have sticks in this one sticks

836
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:28,950
we do we have sticks in this one sticks
 

837
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,280
we do we have sticks in this one sticks
in that one since they're first in line

838
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,290
in that one since they're first in line
 

839
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,320
in that one since they're first in line
they go into the furnace first and then

840
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,330
they go into the furnace first and then
 

841
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,310
they go into the furnace first and then
at the back here is the empty buckets

842
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
at the back here is the empty buckets
 

843
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,860
at the back here is the empty buckets
alright so it does two sticks than an

844
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:39,870
alright so it does two sticks than an
 

845
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,890
alright so it does two sticks than an
empty bucket every time pretty simple

846
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:42,900
empty bucket every time pretty simple
 

847
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,780
empty bucket every time pretty simple
let's let's get this going again so you

848
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,790
let's let's get this going again so you
 

849
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,710
let's let's get this going again so you
just put that in pretty pretty cool

850
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
just put that in pretty pretty cool
 

851
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,160
just put that in pretty pretty cool
though it

852
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,170
though it
 

853
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,660
though it
stops once it's done with all the wet

854
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:50,670
stops once it's done with all the wet
 

855
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,150
stops once it's done with all the wet
sponges on its own there's no like

856
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,160
sponges on its own there's no like
 

857
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,450
sponges on its own there's no like
clocks or anything so here's the other

858
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:56,460
clocks or anything so here's the other
 

859
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,300
clocks or anything so here's the other
big thing when the what what I was going

860
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,310
big thing when the what what I was going
 

861
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,680
big thing when the what what I was going
to say wet budget again when the water

862
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:00,690
to say wet budget again when the water
 

863
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,570
to say wet budget again when the water
budget passes by this hopper

864
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:02,580
budget passes by this hopper
 

865
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,840
budget passes by this hopper
we got a comparator over here to detect

866
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,850
we got a comparator over here to detect
 

867
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,310
we got a comparator over here to detect
it so that lights up every time we get a

868
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
it so that lights up every time we get a
 

869
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,810
it so that lights up every time we get a
water budget passing through and that's

870
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:11,820
water budget passing through and that's
 

871
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,810
water budget passing through and that's
what activates these droppers over and

872
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:14,820
what activates these droppers over and
 

873
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,100
what activates these droppers over and
over and also the wet sponges up here

874
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,110
over and also the wet sponges up here
 

875
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,240
over and also the wet sponges up here
sends power to this block to this

876
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,250
sends power to this block to this
 

877
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,950
sends power to this block to this
dropper so it activates all four

878
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:21,960
dropper so it activates all four
 

879
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,790
dropper so it activates all four
droppers each operation and that's like

880
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:25,800
droppers each operation and that's like
 

881
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,460
droppers each operation and that's like
all there is to it uh-huh all right so

882
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,470
all there is to it uh-huh all right so
 

883
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,380
all there is to it uh-huh all right so
first part done second part now we got

884
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,390
first part done second part now we got
 

885
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,400
first part done second part now we got
to figure out how to fill up the water

886
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,410
to figure out how to fill up the water
 

887
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,030
to figure out how to fill up the water
bottles in a cool way

888
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,040
bottles in a cool way
 

889
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,230
bottles in a cool way
okay so I've been thinking about it here

890
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,240
okay so I've been thinking about it here
 

891
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,300
okay so I've been thinking about it here
I currently have two ideas of how to

892
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,310
I currently have two ideas of how to
 

893
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,250
I currently have two ideas of how to
fill up the water bottles we want this

894
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,260
fill up the water bottles we want this
 

895
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,040
fill up the water bottles we want this
to be as easy to use as possible as

896
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,050
to be as easy to use as possible as
 

897
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,340
to be as easy to use as possible as
quick and simple as possible but also we

898
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,350
quick and simple as possible but also we
 

899
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,290
quick and simple as possible but also we
do want the machine to be as simple to

900
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,300
do want the machine to be as simple to
 

901
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,590
do want the machine to be as simple to
build as possible to so of my two ideas

902
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:54,600
build as possible to so of my two ideas
 

903
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,870
build as possible to so of my two ideas
one of them is simple just the single

904
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
one of them is simple just the single
 

905
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,760
one of them is simple just the single
cauldron the other one is more

906
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:58,770
cauldron the other one is more
 

907
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,130
cauldron the other one is more
complicated involving a piston type

908
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,140
complicated involving a piston type
 

909
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,530
complicated involving a piston type
thing of cauldron so five at the minimum

910
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:03,540
thing of cauldron so five at the minimum
 

911
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,960
thing of cauldron so five at the minimum
and you would probably want more though

912
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:05,970
and you would probably want more though
 

913
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,620
and you would probably want more though
like maybe even up to 64 you could fit a

914
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:09,630
like maybe even up to 64 you could fit a
 

915
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,800
like maybe even up to 64 you could fit a
full stack of sponge water into your

916
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:12,810
full stack of sponge water into your
 

917
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,800
full stack of sponge water into your
cauldrons that way enough to do 192

918
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:15,810
cauldrons that way enough to do 192
 

919
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,310
cauldrons that way enough to do 192
potions without having to refill them

920
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
potions without having to refill them
 

921
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,890
potions without having to refill them
okay but here is the thing I just set up

922
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:21,900
okay but here is the thing I just set up
 

923
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,290
okay but here is the thing I just set up
like the spiral thing here so we press

924
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,300
like the spiral thing here so we press
 

925
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,750
like the spiral thing here so we press
the button here and see the cauldrons

926
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:26,760
the button here and see the cauldrons
 

927
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,940
the button here and see the cauldrons
switch places they're also got a

928
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:28,950
switch places they're also got a
 

929
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,950
switch places they're also got a
comparator detecting when we fill it up

930
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
comparator detecting when we fill it up
 

931
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,380
comparator detecting when we fill it up
a water so it should do it automatically

932
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,390
a water so it should do it automatically
 

933
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,530
a water so it should do it automatically
so let's let's try this out okay so you

934
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:39,540
so let's let's try this out okay so you
 

935
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,600
so let's let's try this out okay so you
would probably fill up all the cultures

936
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:41,610
would probably fill up all the cultures
 

937
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,670
would probably fill up all the cultures
with water at a time so you would fill

938
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:43,680
with water at a time so you would fill
 

939
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:56,330
with water at a time so you would fill
one what happened no wait oh I see it

940
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,340
one what happened no wait oh I see it
 

941
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,160
one what happened no wait oh I see it
sent power to this but I also sent power

942
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,170
sent power to this but I also sent power
 

943
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,490
sent power to this but I also sent power
back here we don't want that ah-ha I

944
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,500
back here we don't want that ah-ha I
 

945
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,620
back here we don't want that ah-ha I
think

946
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:03,630
think
 

947
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,370
think
power didn't go through to the other

948
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:05,380
power didn't go through to the other
 

949
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:13,020
power didn't go through to the other
side that's kind of weird right wait a

950
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,030
side that's kind of weird right wait a
 

951
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,990
side that's kind of weird right wait a
minute something very strange is

952
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
minute something very strange is

click in any way that would be the dream
hmm and then you'd have to do the

980
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
hmm and then you'd have to do the
 

981
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,330
hmm and then you'd have to do the
reverse to so when you empty the

982
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:00,340
reverse to so when you empty the
 

983
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,820
reverse to so when you empty the
cauldrons you'd make it cycle then - oh

984
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:04,830
cauldrons you'd make it cycle then - oh
 

985
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,620

this would be the way to go if it works

988
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:09,810
this would be the way to go if it works
 

989
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,690
this would be the way to go if it works
but Mojang I don't know did you do it

I was also recently disappointed like I

1008
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:41,650
I was also recently disappointed like I
 

1009

I was also recently disappointed like I
tried you know how you can light a

1010
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,180
tried you know how you can light a
 

1011
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,110
tried you know how you can light a
creeper on fire or ignite a creeper with

creeper on fire or ignite a creeper with
a flint and steel where they'll

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,140
a flint and steel where they'll

automatically blow up I tried doing that

1016
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
automatically blow up I tried doing that
 

1017
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,570
automatically blow up I tried doing that
recently with a dispenser and it didn't

1018
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:51,580
recently with a dispenser and it didn't
 

1019
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,070
recently with a dispenser and it didn't
work like a flint and steel in a

1020
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,080
work like a flint and steel in a
 

1021
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,460
work like a flint and steel in a
dispenser and then you make it hit hit a

1022
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:56,470
dispenser and then you make it hit hit a
 

1023
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,080
dispenser and then you make it hit hit a
creeper it doesn't make the creeper blow

1024
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,090
creeper it doesn't make the creeper blow
 

1025
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:04,400
creeper it doesn't make the creeper blow
up like like you would think all right

1026
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,410

 

1027
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,200

yeah I think it just ejected it yeah

1028
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,210
yeah I think it just ejected it yeah
 

1029
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,130
yeah I think it just ejected it yeah
okay so you can't fill them okay so I'm

1030
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,140
okay so you can't fill them okay so I'm
 

1031
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,080
okay so you can't fill them okay so I'm
experimenting with two more ideas here

1032
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,090
experimenting with two more ideas here
 

1033
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,380
experimenting with two more ideas here
which are poo

1034
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,390
which are poo
 

1035
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,830
which are poo
this one got away from me a little bit

1036
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
this one got away from me a little bit
 

1037
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,900
this one got away from me a little bit
but the main concept I'll show you here

1038
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:20,910
but the main concept I'll show you here
 

1039

but the main concept I'll show you here
grab a water bucket let's get these out

grab a water bucket let's get these out
 

1041
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,720
grab a water bucket let's get these out
of here too I want to try make a system

1042
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:26,730
of here too I want to try make a system
 

1043
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,700

where you just hold right click and

1044
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:28,710
where you just hold right click and
 

1045
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,510
where you just hold right click and
press Q every time you get a new item so

1046
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
press Q every time you get a new item so
 

1047
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,740
press Q every time you get a new item so
watch what happens when you hold right

1048
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:33,750
watch what happens when you hold right
 

1049
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,860

click on this cauldron trapdoor Goes

1050
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:36,870
click on this cauldron trapdoor Goes
 

1051
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,720
click on this cauldron trapdoor Goes
Down that stops you from pulling the

1052
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:38,730
Down that stops you from pulling the
 

1053
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,330
Down that stops you from pulling the
water back out of it all right because

1054
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,340
water back out of it all right because
 

1055
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,600
water back out of it all right because
you can do that if you hold right click

1056
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:44,610
you can do that if you hold right click
 

1057
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,630
you can do that if you hold right click
normally this is what happens - the

1058
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:47,640
normally this is what happens - the
 

1059
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,140
normally this is what happens - the
trapdoor so the idea is you can hold

1060
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,150
trapdoor so the idea is you can hold
 

1061
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,390
trapdoor so the idea is you can hold
right click doesn't pick the water up

1062
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,400
right click doesn't pick the water up
 

1063
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,140
right click doesn't pick the water up
again then you press Q throws item in

1064
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,150
again then you press Q throws item in
 

1065
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,810
again then you press Q throws item in
the hopper here it detects that it's an

1066
00:24:59,810 --> 00:24:59,820
the hopper here it detects that it's an
 

1067
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,790
the hopper here it detects that it's an
empty bucket so the trapdoor goes back

1068
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:01,800
empty bucket so the trapdoor goes back
 

1069
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,100
empty bucket so the trapdoor goes back
up and then you would have it dispense

1070
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,110
up and then you would have it dispense
 

1071
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,780
up and then you would have it dispense
one empty bottle at you let's say

1072
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:08,790
one empty bottle at you let's say
 

1073
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,000
one empty bottle at you let's say
there's there's bottles in here hold

1074
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,010
there's there's bottles in here hold
 

1075
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,090
there's there's bottles in here hold
right you'd still be holding right click

1076
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,100
right you'd still be holding right click
 

1077
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,770
right you'd still be holding right click
now before you would drink the water you

1078
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:15,780
now before you would drink the water you
 

1079
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,220
now before you would drink the water you
would press Q to throw it that would

1080
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,230
would press Q to throw it that would
 

1081
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,050
would press Q to throw it that would
give you another bottle q Q and then you

1082
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,060
give you another bottle q Q and then you
 

1083
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,420
give you another bottle q Q and then you
would get a water budget but I got a

1084
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,430
would get a water budget but I got a
 

1085
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,730
would get a water budget but I got a
bottle there so it's not perfectly set

1086
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:28,740
bottle there so it's not perfectly set
 

1087
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,820
bottle there so it's not perfectly set
up yet you told right click oh it's

1088
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:31,830
up yet you told right click oh it's
 

1089
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,310
up yet you told right click oh it's
broken I don't know then you would have

1090
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
broken I don't know then you would have
 

1091
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,690
broken I don't know then you would have
to know it's broken right I don't know

1092
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:38,700
to know it's broken right I don't know
 

1093
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,940
to know it's broken right I don't know
oh now it's working hold right click

1094
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:42,950
oh now it's working hold right click
 

1095
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,680
oh now it's working hold right click
throw that it's not quite perfect at the

1096
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:45,690
throw that it's not quite perfect at the
 

1097
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:52,340
throw that it's not quite perfect at the
moment hold right click q q Q and then

1098
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,350
moment hold right click q q Q and then
 

1099
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,470
moment hold right click q q Q and then
ideally get a water budget here my big

1100
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:57,480
ideally get a water budget here my big
 

1101
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
ideally get a water budget here my big
concern with this idea though guys is it

1102
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,490
concern with this idea though guys is it
 

1103
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,010
concern with this idea though guys is it
might be a little bit slow like it took

1104
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,020
might be a little bit slow like it took
 

1105
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,540
might be a little bit slow like it took
a little while to fill up the water

1106
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:02,550
a little while to fill up the water
 

1107
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,220
a little while to fill up the water
bottles there and that's just because of

1108
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,230
bottles there and that's just because of
 

1109
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,680
bottles there and that's just because of
the redstone delay that I don't know if

1110
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:06,690
the redstone delay that I don't know if
 

1111
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,500
the redstone delay that I don't know if
I can make any shorter really it's also

1112
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,510
I can make any shorter really it's also
 

1113
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,020
I can make any shorter really it's also
going to be complicated to design and

1114
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,030
going to be complicated to design and
 

1115
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,230
going to be complicated to design and
build so difficult for me to design and

1116
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,240
build so difficult for me to design and
 

1117
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,710
build so difficult for me to design and
difficult for you guys to build so yeah

1118
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
difficult for you guys to build so yeah
 

1119
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,990
difficult for you guys to build so yeah
this is the other idea I had the second

1120
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,000
this is the other idea I had the second
 

1121
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,280
this is the other idea I had the second
idea which is a lot simpler it would

1122
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,290
idea which is a lot simpler it would
 

1123
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,140
idea which is a lot simpler it would
work something like this let's try it

1124
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,150
work something like this let's try it
 

1125
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,270
work something like this let's try it
out so you would get a water bottle

1126
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,280
out so you would get a water bottle
 

1127
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,950
out so you would get a water bottle
or a water budget from here to begin

1128
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
or a water budget from here to begin
 

1129
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,010
or a water budget from here to begin
with so from our sponge machine all the

1130
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,020
with so from our sponge machine all the
 

1131
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,590
with so from our sponge machine all the
water buckets will collect here and then

1132
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,600
water buckets will collect here and then
 

1133
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
water buckets will collect here and then
you would right click on the the

1134
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:38,610
you would right click on the the
 

1135
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,070
you would right click on the the
cauldron you can hold right clicked or

1136
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
cauldron you can hold right clicked or
 

1137
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,400
cauldron you can hold right clicked or
anything then you would right click

1138
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,410
anything then you would right click
 

1139
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,350
anything then you would right click
right click right click with a full

1140
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
right click right click with a full
 

1141
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,150
right click right click with a full
inventory those are going in here

1142
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,160
inventory those are going in here
 

1143
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,760
inventory those are going in here
they're getting sorted there's an item

1144
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:49,770
they're getting sorted there's an item
 

1145
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,560
they're getting sorted there's an item
filter here that collects empty buckets

1146
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,570
filter here that collects empty buckets
 

1147
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,750
filter here that collects empty buckets
so the empty buckets don't go in here

1148
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
so the empty buckets don't go in here
 

1149
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,540
so the empty buckets don't go in here
they go down and when it detects an

1150
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:56,550
they go down and when it detects an
 

1151
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,700
they go down and when it detects an
empty bucket going through it also sends

1152
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:58,710
empty bucket going through it also sends
 

1153
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,400
empty bucket going through it also sends
a redstone signal up here to the dropper

1154
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,410
a redstone signal up here to the dropper
 

1155
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,140
a redstone signal up here to the dropper
to give us another water bucket if there

1156
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,150
to give us another water bucket if there
 

1157
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,710
to give us another water bucket if there
is one so it repeats the process so

1158
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
is one so it repeats the process so
 

1159
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,260
is one so it repeats the process so
basically throw this in get water do

1160
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,270
basically throw this in get water do
 

1161
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,480
basically throw this in get water do
that right click right click right click

1162
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,490
that right click right click right click
 

1163
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,740
that right click right click right click
throw a bucket right click right click

1164
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:15,750
throw a bucket right click right click
 

1165
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,900
throw a bucket right click right click
right click throw budgets yeah it's not

1166
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:20,910
right click throw budgets yeah it's not
 

1167
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,260
right click throw budgets yeah it's not
quite as a user friendly like you got to

1168
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,270
quite as a user friendly like you got to
 

1169
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,460
quite as a user friendly like you got to
actually think a little bit right click

1170
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,470
actually think a little bit right click
 

1171
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,620
actually think a little bit right click
right click right-click right-click uh

1172
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:33,630
right click right-click right-click uh
 

1173
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,800
right click right-click right-click uh
at least didn't go down below yes I

1174
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:36,810
at least didn't go down below yes I
 

1175
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,780
at least didn't go down below yes I
don't know I don't know I got to think

1176
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:38,790
don't know I don't know I got to think
 

1177
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,070
don't know I don't know I got to think
about this so I decided I don't like

1178
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,080
about this so I decided I don't like
 

1179
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
about this so I decided I don't like
this one here guys honestly it's too

1180
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,090
this one here guys honestly it's too
 

1181
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,520
this one here guys honestly it's too
much for old details it's too

1182
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:46,530
much for old details it's too
 

1183
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,830
much for old details it's too
complicated even though it's simpler to

1184
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:48,840
complicated even though it's simpler to
 

1185
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,260
complicated even though it's simpler to
build you got to like right click

1186
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,270
build you got to like right click
 

1187
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,000
build you got to like right click
sometimes sometimes you got to press Q

1188
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,010
sometimes sometimes you got to press Q
 

1189
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,020
sometimes sometimes you got to press Q
sometimes you get to switch your

1190
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,030
sometimes you get to switch your
 

1191
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,090
sometimes you get to switch your
inventory spots there's a lot going on

1192
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,100
inventory spots there's a lot going on
 

1193
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,710
inventory spots there's a lot going on
just to fill up some water bottles right

1194
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:57,720
just to fill up some water bottles right
 

1195
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,130
just to fill up some water bottles right
it's too much too much ideally we want

1196
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,140
it's too much too much ideally we want
 

1197
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,950
it's too much too much ideally we want
to try to get as close as we can to how

1198
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:03,960
to try to get as close as we can to how
 

1199
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,720
to try to get as close as we can to how
you fill them in the overworld we just

1200
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:05,730
you fill them in the overworld we just
 

1201
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,990
you fill them in the overworld we just
hold right click at water fills them up

1202
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,000
hold right click at water fills them up
 

1203
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,300
hold right click at water fills them up
and if your inventory fills up they

1204
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,310
and if your inventory fills up they
 

1205
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,280
and if your inventory fills up they
start spraying out and you can pick them

1206
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,290
start spraying out and you can pick them
 

1207
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,450
start spraying out and you can pick them
up with a hopper that's like the dream

1208
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:16,460
up with a hopper that's like the dream
 

1209
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,070
up with a hopper that's like the dream
for our nether system I think I've

1210
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,080
for our nether system I think I've
 

1211
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,900
for our nether system I think I've
gotten about as close to that dream as

1212
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:20,910
gotten about as close to that dream as
 

1213
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,820
gotten about as close to that dream as
possible here though I decide to refine

1214
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:22,830
possible here though I decide to refine
 

1215
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,710
possible here though I decide to refine
this one makes it faster make it better

1216
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
this one makes it faster make it better
 

1217
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,150
this one makes it faster make it better
not quite as scary looking so here let's

1218
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,160
not quite as scary looking so here let's
 

1219
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,520
not quite as scary looking so here let's
go for a little test run okay so we got

1220
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,530
go for a little test run okay so we got
 

1221
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,460
go for a little test run okay so we got
our water in there empty bottles there

1222
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,470
our water in there empty bottles there
 

1223
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,650
our water in there empty bottles there
so what we would do to start off with

1224
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:36,660
so what we would do to start off with
 

1225
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,770
so what we would do to start off with
get our water our sponge water all right

1226
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:39,780
get our water our sponge water all right
 

1227
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,830
get our water our sponge water all right
and all we got to do is hold right click

1228
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
and all we got to do is hold right click
 

1229
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,350
and all we got to do is hold right click
and press Q every time we get a new item

1230
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
and press Q every time we get a new item
 

1231
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,730
and press Q every time we get a new item
in our inventory Kaew Kaew Kaew Kaew

1232
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:51,740
in our inventory Kaew Kaew Kaew Kaew
 

1233
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,720
in our inventory Kaew Kaew Kaew Kaew
Kaew Kaew Kaew so it's quite a bit

1234
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:56,730
Kaew Kaew Kaew so it's quite a bit
 

1235
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,540
Kaew Kaew Kaew so it's quite a bit
faster now right it's not too bad it's

1236
00:28:59,540 --> 00:28:59,550
faster now right it's not too bad it's
 

1237
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,220
faster now right it's not too bad it's
not too bad it's not as fast as

1238
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,230
not too bad it's not as fast as
 

1239
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,060
not too bad it's not as fast as
overworld filling and I'm using that

1240
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,070
overworld filling and I'm using that
 

1241
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,730
overworld filling and I'm using that
empty water bucket at the N or empty

1242
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:07,740
empty water bucket at the N or empty
 

1243
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,370
empty water bucket at the N or empty
water bottle at the end there to tell it

1244
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:10,380
water bottle at the end there to tell it
 

1245
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,850
water bottle at the end there to tell it
to give me a water budget otherwise I

1246
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:13,860
to give me a water budget otherwise I
 

1247
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,610
to give me a water budget otherwise I
would have to count to three with the

1248
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:16,620
would have to count to three with the
 

1249
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,020
would have to count to three with the
water bottles here and that would

1250
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,030
water bottles here and that would
 

1251
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,850
water bottles here and that would
require much more complicated redstone

1252
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:22,860
require much more complicated redstone
 

1253
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,430
require much more complicated redstone
so I'm kind of doing a trick with it

1254
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440

 

1255
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,220

yeah it's not too bad right and we got

1256
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,230
yeah it's not too bad right and we got
 

1257
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,890
yeah it's not too bad right and we got
water so it keep going until you either

1258
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:36,900
water so it keep going until you either
 

1259
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,930
water so it keep going until you either
stop or this runs out of water ball or

1260
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:38,940
stop or this runs out of water ball or
 

1261
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,280
stop or this runs out of water ball or
water buckets all right guys so I think

1262
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,290
water buckets all right guys so I think
 

1263
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,590
water buckets all right guys so I think
we pretty much got this designed we're

1264
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
we pretty much got this designed we're
 

1265
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,960
we pretty much got this designed we're
also very very much out of time for

1266
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:47,970
also very very much out of time for
 

1267
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,310
also very very much out of time for
today

1268
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
today
 

1269
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,780
today
so what we're going to do like we got

1270
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:50,790
so what we're going to do like we got
 

1271
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,970
so what we're going to do like we got
part one done I'm really happy with part

1272
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:52,980
part one done I'm really happy with part
 

1273
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,430
part one done I'm really happy with part
one part two might be able to improve it

1274
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
one part two might be able to improve it
 

1275
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,920
one part two might be able to improve it
a little bit more yet but what we would

1276
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:57,930
a little bit more yet but what we would
 

1277
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,930
a little bit more yet but what we would
do I should have mirrored this so that

1278
00:29:59,930 --> 00:29:59,940
do I should have mirrored this so that
 

1279
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,230
do I should have mirrored this so that
the water the water buckets were on this

1280
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,240
the water the water buckets were on this
 

1281
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,610
the water the water buckets were on this
side then we could just connect it

1282
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:04,620
side then we could just connect it
 

1283
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,660
side then we could just connect it
directly to this chess pretty much and

1284
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,670
directly to this chess pretty much and
 

1285
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,940
directly to this chess pretty much and
build them side by side that's what I'm

1286
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:10,950
build them side by side that's what I'm
 

1287
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,520
build them side by side that's what I'm
going to do most likely the other thing

1288
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:13,530
going to do most likely the other thing
 

1289
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,300
going to do most likely the other thing
we got to do though is I'm using item

1290
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,310
we got to do though is I'm using item
 

1291
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,810
we got to do though is I'm using item
filters down here to detect when we the

1292
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:20,820
filters down here to detect when we the
 

1293
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,780
filters down here to detect when we the
change that needs to happen when we

1294
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:22,790
change that needs to happen when we
 

1295
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,780
change that needs to happen when we
switch from you know filling it with the

1296
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:26,790
switch from you know filling it with the
 

1297
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,150
switch from you know filling it with the
bucket and and when we're done with the

1298
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,160
bucket and and when we're done with the
 

1299
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,150
bucket and and when we're done with the
water bottles I signify we're done

1300
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,160
water bottles I signify we're done
 

1301
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,950
water bottles I signify we're done
filling with water bottles by throwing a

1302
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:33,960
filling with water bottles by throwing a
 

1303
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,290
filling with water bottles by throwing a
glass bottle in here so this detects

1304
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,300
glass bottle in here so this detects
 

1305
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,390
glass bottle in here so this detects
when we throw the glass bottle in this

1306
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:38,400
when we throw the glass bottle in this
 

1307
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
when we throw the glass bottle in this
is the text when we throw the empty

1308
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:39,810
is the text when we throw the empty
 

1309
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,820
is the text when we throw the empty
bucket in the problem is these just kind

1310
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:43,830
bucket in the problem is these just kind
 

1311
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,320
bucket in the problem is these just kind
of get stuck here at the moment so

1312
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,330
of get stuck here at the moment so
 

1313
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,390
of get stuck here at the moment so
ideally I would like these glass bottles

1314
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:47,400
ideally I would like these glass bottles
 

1315
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,160
ideally I would like these glass bottles
to go back up to our our dropper here

1316
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,170
to go back up to our our dropper here
 

1317
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,159
to go back up to our our dropper here
right get

1318
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:56,169
right get
 

1319
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,169
right get
back in there and then these empty

1320
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:58,179
back in there and then these empty
 

1321
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,299
back in there and then these empty
buckets we need to connect up to our

1322
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:00,309
buckets we need to connect up to our
 

1323
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:03,049
buckets we need to connect up to our
part one here they need to go back into

1324
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:03,059
part one here they need to go back into
 

1325
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:06,330
part one here they need to go back into
here and that kind of completes the

1326
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,340
here and that kind of completes the
 

1327
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,399
here and that kind of completes the
cycle and then the water bottles just

1328
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:08,409
cycle and then the water bottles just
 

1329
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:12,749
cycle and then the water bottles just
have to go into our brewing system okay

1330
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:12,759
have to go into our brewing system okay
 

1331
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,369
have to go into our brewing system okay
so here's the plan guys let me know if

1332
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:14,379
so here's the plan guys let me know if
 

1333
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:16,619
so here's the plan guys let me know if
this is a good plan or not I'm going to

1334
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:16,629
this is a good plan or not I'm going to
 

1335
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,869
this is a good plan or not I'm going to
try to refine that get it built for next

1336
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:18,879
try to refine that get it built for next
 

1337
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,279
try to refine that get it built for next
episode so we can check it out right

1338
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:20,289
episode so we can check it out right
 

1339
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:22,070
episode so we can check it out right

what I will do if you're interested I

1342
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
what I will do if you're interested I
 

1343
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,649
what I will do if you're interested I
might make a tutorial for it it's kind

1344
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:28,659
might make a tutorial for it it's kind
 

1345
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,799
might make a tutorial for it it's kind
of like I don't know though

1346
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:30,809
of like I don't know though
 

1347
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:33,359
of like I don't know though
like most people don't even want to

1348
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:33,369
like most people don't even want to
 

1349
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,549
like most people don't even want to
attempt to build a normal brewing system

1350
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:35,559
attempt to build a normal brewing system
 

1351
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,180
attempt to build a normal brewing system
and this is like another brewing system

1352
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,190
and this is like another brewing system
 

1353
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,129
and this is like another brewing system
all that part 1 and part 2 stuff is

1354
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:41,139
all that part 1 and part 2 stuff is
 

1355
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:44,759
all that part 1 and part 2 stuff is
extra complication so I don't know how

1356
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:44,769
extra complication so I don't know how
 

1357
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,460
extra complication so I don't know how
much interested they're actually how

1358
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:47,470
much interested they're actually how
 

1359
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,169
much interested they're actually how
much interest there actually is in this

1360
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:49,179
much interest there actually is in this
 

1361
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,899
much interest there actually is in this
build you'll have to let me know if you

1362
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:51,909
build you'll have to let me know if you
 

1363
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,700
build you'll have to let me know if you
found it if you think you would ever

1364
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:53,710
found it if you think you would ever
 

1365
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,590
found it if you think you would ever
build something like this in your world

1366
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
build something like this in your world
 

1367
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,389
build something like this in your world
or if you this thing is a stupid idea

1368

like 20 or 30 villagers running around

1386
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:27,460
like 20 or 30 villagers running around
 

1387

like 20 or 30 villagers running around
here zombie siege zombie sieges happen

1388
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:31,539
here zombie siege zombie sieges happen
 

1389
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,340
here zombie siege zombie sieges happen
so often when you play on hard mode and

1390
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,350
so often when you play on hard mode and
 

1391
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,109
so often when you play on hard mode and
you see my local difficulty is that 6.38

1392
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:39,119
you see my local difficulty is that 6.38
 

1393
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,049
you see my local difficulty is that 6.38
if I stay here for like 30 minutes or

1394
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:43,059
if I stay here for like 30 minutes or
 

1395
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:47,070
if I stay here for like 30 minutes or
less probably all the villagers will die

1396
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,080
less probably all the villagers will die
 

1397
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,200
less probably all the villagers will die
I have to like constantly keep an eye

1398
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,210
I have to like constantly keep an eye
 

1399
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,499
I have to like constantly keep an eye
out for it and just recently I lost like

1400
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:52,509
out for it and just recently I lost like
 

1401
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:57,210
out for it and just recently I lost like
20 villagers so be very careful if

1402
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,220
20 villagers so be very careful if
 

1403
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,560
20 villagers so be very careful if
you're playing on hard and you have

you're playing on hard and you have
 

1405
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,119
you're playing on hard and you have
villages as they happen pretty often

1406
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:02,129
villages as they happen pretty often
 

1407
