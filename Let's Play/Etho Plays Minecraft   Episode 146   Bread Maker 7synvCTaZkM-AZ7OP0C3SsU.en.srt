encase the spawner and set up a

504
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
encase the spawner and set up a
 

505
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,750
encase the spawner and set up a
collection system for it so we can get

506

our
 

509
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,630
our
our bones going and i'll probably just

510
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
our bones going and i'll probably just
 

511
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,590
our bones going and i'll probably just
encase it with stone bricks

512
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
encase it with stone bricks
 

513
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,269
encase it with stone bricks
and that might give you a little bit of

514
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
and that might give you a little bit of
 

515
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,590
and that might give you a little bit of
updates on that

516
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
updates on that
 

517
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,590
updates on that
then once i got that going i will start

518
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
then once i got that going i will start
 

519
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,870
then once i got that going i will start
work on

520
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
work on
 

521
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,949
work on
the wheat farm and it turns out

522
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
the wheat farm and it turns out
 

523
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,550
the wheat farm and it turns out
this spawner down here this other

524
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
this spawner down here this other
 

525
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,190
this spawner down here this other
skeleton spawner is just out of range

526
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
skeleton spawner is just out of range
 

527
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,230
skeleton spawner is just out of range
so we won't be able to use both of them

528
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
so we won't be able to use both of them
 

529
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,910
so we won't be able to use both of them
unfortunately it's like two or three

530
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
unfortunately it's like two or three
 

531
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,150
unfortunately it's like two or three
blocks too far away

532
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
blocks too far away
 

533
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,190
blocks too far away
or something ridiculous so

534
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
or something ridiculous so
 

535
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,030
or something ridiculous so
oh well what can you do

536
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
oh well what can you do
 

537
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,870
oh well what can you do
i like that one over there because it's

538
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
i like that one over there because it's
 

539
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,629
i like that one over there because it's
near the surface

540
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
near the surface
 

541
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,190
near the surface
it's uh it's pretty rare to find them

542
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
it's uh it's pretty rare to find them
 

543
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,389
it's uh it's pretty rare to find them
that close to the surface

544
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
that close to the surface
 

545
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,790
that close to the surface
well not rare but it's awesome when you

546
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
well not rare but it's awesome when you
 

547
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,870
well not rare but it's awesome when you
do because you can actually build things

548
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
do because you can actually build things
 

549
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,629
do because you can actually build things
on the surface that use the mobs

550
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
on the surface that use the mobs
 

551
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,710
on the surface that use the mobs
so believe it or not i might actually

552
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
so believe it or not i might actually
 

553
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,150
so believe it or not i might actually
build something above ground

554
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
build something above ground
 

555
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,350
build something above ground
on this one and i am going to get

556
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
on this one and i am going to get
 

557
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,310
on this one and i am going to get
started here so

558
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
started here so
 

559
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,750
started here so
i'll see you in a few few minutes here

560
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760

 

561
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,470

yeah so it's coming along well here i

562
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
yeah so it's coming along well here i
 

563
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,110
yeah so it's coming along well here i
got most

564
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
got most
 

565
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,310
got most
grunt work done and we're just about to

566
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
grunt work done and we're just about to
 

567
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,030
grunt work done and we're just about to
seal it up and put the

568
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040

 

569
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,790

put the water streams in and stuff

570
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
put the water streams in and stuff
 

571
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,150
put the water streams in and stuff
lighting i'm going to put a lighting

572
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
lighting i'm going to put a lighting
 

573
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,150
lighting i'm going to put a lighting
system into it

574
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
system into it
 

575
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,470
system into it
uh the plan is to make the skeletons

576
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
uh the plan is to make the skeletons
 

577
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,670
uh the plan is to make the skeletons
kind of go up

578
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
kind of go up
 

579
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,470
kind of go up
and then to the right here

580
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480

 

581
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,829

and i'll probably have the wheat farm

582
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
and i'll probably have the wheat farm
 

583
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,710
and i'll probably have the wheat farm
somewhere

584
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
somewhere
 

585
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,470
somewhere
up here too eventually i will probably

586
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
up here too eventually i will probably
 

587
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,550
up here too eventually i will probably
make like a building like a bakery or

588
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
make like a building like a bakery or
 

589
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,509
make like a building like a bakery or
something

590
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
something
 

591
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,670
something
just for the novelty of it and uh

592
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680

 

593
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,190

these guys are distracting

594
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200

 

595
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,269

yeah we'll have like a bakery building

596
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
yeah we'll have like a bakery building
 

597
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,110
yeah we'll have like a bakery building
or something here eventually

598
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
or something here eventually
 

599
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,389
or something here eventually
uh the skeletons will probably be an

600
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
uh the skeletons will probably be an
 

601
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,350
uh the skeletons will probably be an
xp farm or have the option of killing

602
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
xp farm or have the option of killing
 

603
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,310
xp farm or have the option of killing
them

604
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
them
 

605
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,110
them
or something like that i don't know

606
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
or something like that i don't know
 

607
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,790
or something like that i don't know
exactly how i'm going to do it but i

608
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
exactly how i'm going to do it but i
 

609
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,389
exactly how i'm going to do it but i
think we should head down

610
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
think we should head down
 

611
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,790
think we should head down
that creeper is still here though i do

612
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
that creeper is still here though i do
 

613
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,870
that creeper is still here though i do
not want him blowing up that spawner or

614
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
not want him blowing up that spawner or
 

615
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,069
not want him blowing up that spawner or
i will

616
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
i will
 

617
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,990
i will
have a hissy fit and i don't trust me

618
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
have a hissy fit and i don't trust me
 

619
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
have a hissy fit and i don't trust me
or i don't trust myself on these broken

620
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
or i don't trust myself on these broken
 

621
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,430
or i don't trust myself on these broken
ladders

622
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
ladders
 

623
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,310
ladders
or the fixed broken ladders or whatever

624
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320

 

625
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,069

good okay so when i make these

626
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
good okay so when i make these
 

627
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,550
good okay so when i make these
mob systems i pretty much do them all

628
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
mob systems i pretty much do them all
 

629
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,670
mob systems i pretty much do them all
the exact same way

630
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
the exact same way
 

631
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,629
the exact same way
because it's it's the best way in my

632
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
because it's it's the best way in my
 

633
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,829
because it's it's the best way in my
opinion

634
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
opinion
 

635
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,870
opinion
so it's an eight by eight area here

636
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
so it's an eight by eight area here
 

637
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,150
so it's an eight by eight area here
uh to maximize the amount of spawning

638
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
uh to maximize the amount of spawning
 

639
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,269
uh to maximize the amount of spawning
space

640
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
space
 

641
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,829
space
and the spawning rates so

642
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
and the spawning rates so
 

643
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,110
and the spawning rates so
spawners over here will mark that

644
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120

 

645
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,110

i've talked about this many times before

646
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
i've talked about this many times before
 

647
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,470
i've talked about this many times before
but

648
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
but
 

649
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,750
but
this wall here at the f3

650
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
this wall here at the f3
 

651
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,829
this wall here at the f3
direction is three blocks away then at

652
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
direction is three blocks away then at
 

653
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,750
direction is three blocks away then at
zero i have it

654
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
zero i have it
 

655
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,430
zero i have it
three blocks away one is four blocks

656
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
three blocks away one is four blocks
 

657
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,470
three blocks away one is four blocks
away

658
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
away
 

659
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,470
away
two three four and then

660
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
two three four and then
 

661
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,670
two three four and then
two is also four blocks away so one

662
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
two is also four blocks away so one
 

663
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,389
two is also four blocks away so one
one two three four away from the spawner

664
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
one two three four away from the spawner
 

665
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,110
one two three four away from the spawner
that is

666
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
that is
 

667
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,910
that is
so it's an eight by eight room but the

668
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
so it's an eight by eight room but the
 

669
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,670
so it's an eight by eight room but the
spawner can't be centered

670
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
spawner can't be centered
 

671
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,670
spawner can't be centered
in it because it's an even number so

672
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
in it because it's an even number so
 

673
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,590
in it because it's an even number so
that's the way that works

674
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
that's the way that works
 

675
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,509
that's the way that works
two of the walls are three blocks away

676
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
two of the walls are three blocks away
 

677
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,949
two of the walls are three blocks away
and two of the

678
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
and two of the
 

679
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,550
and two of the
two two of the other walls are four

680
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
two two of the other walls are four
 

681
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,150
two two of the other walls are four
blocks away so

682
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
blocks away so
 

683
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,590
blocks away so
yeah enough blabbering about that i'll

684
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
yeah enough blabbering about that i'll
 

685
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,230
yeah enough blabbering about that i'll
use glowstone for the lighting i guess

686
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
use glowstone for the lighting i guess
 

687
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,430
use glowstone for the lighting i guess
and oh yeah you'll need two

688
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
and oh yeah you'll need two
 

689
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,629
and oh yeah you'll need two
blocks of airspace below the spawner and

690
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
blocks of airspace below the spawner and
 

691
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,590
blocks of airspace below the spawner and
two blocks

692
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
two blocks
 

693
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,430
two blocks
um yeah two blocks above it as well

694
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
um yeah two blocks above it as well
 

695
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,750
um yeah two blocks above it as well
so this roof i'm putting on

696
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
so this roof i'm putting on
 

697
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,990
so this roof i'm putting on
is two blocks oops

698
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
is two blocks oops
 

699
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,550
is two blocks oops
or will be two two air spaces above i'll

700
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
or will be two two air spaces above i'll
 

701
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,110
or will be two two air spaces above i'll
just bring it closer so you can see

702
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
just bring it closer so you can see
 

703
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,790
just bring it closer so you can see
so one two

704
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
so one two
 

705
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,550
so one two
okay uh the lighting

706
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
okay uh the lighting
 

707
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,629
okay uh the lighting
how do i do this i'm going off memory on

708
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
how do i do this i'm going off memory on
 

709
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,150
how do i do this i'm going off memory on
this i think i put it

710
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
this i think i put it
 

711
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,790
this i think i put it
level with the spawner and

712
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800

 

713
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,189

the fifth block in or so

714
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199

 

715
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,550

or fourth block from one side and then i

716
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
or fourth block from one side and then i
 

717
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,430
or fourth block from one side and then i
put

718
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
put
 

719
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,910
put
the lighting back there do that for

720
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
the lighting back there do that for
 

721
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,590
the lighting back there do that for
oh this might be a little bit different

722
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
oh this might be a little bit different
 

723
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,350
oh this might be a little bit different
with the skeleton trap

724
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
with the skeleton trap
 

725
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,509
with the skeleton trap
now that i think of it because uh this

726
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
now that i think of it because uh this
 

727
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,189
now that i think of it because uh this
has to be two blocks high for them to

728
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
has to be two blocks high for them to
 

729
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,949
has to be two blocks high for them to
fit in here

730
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
fit in here
 

731
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:17,189
fit in here
it would go normally over here

732
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199

 

733
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,470

i'll have to think about this i'll put

734
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
i'll have to think about this i'll put
 

735
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,710
i'll have to think about this i'll put
it there for now anyway

736
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
it there for now anyway
 

737
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,550
it there for now anyway
over here one two three four

738
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
over here one two three four
 

739
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,990
over here one two three four
stick it in there and

740
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
stick it in there and
 

741
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,269
stick it in there and
one two three four so this will

742
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
one two three four so this will
 

743
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,990
one two three four so this will
this will light it enough that light it

744
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
this will light it enough that light it
 

745
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,069
this will light it enough that light it
up enough so that skeletons won't spawn

746
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
up enough so that skeletons won't spawn
 

747
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,389
up enough so that skeletons won't spawn
when the lights are exposed like this so

748
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
when the lights are exposed like this so
 

749
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,710
when the lights are exposed like this so
we don't need these torches anymore

750
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720

 

751
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,949

it's daytime anyway then i have pistons

752
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
it's daytime anyway then i have pistons
 

753
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,629
it's daytime anyway then i have pistons
sticky pistons that go

754
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639

 

755
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,790

over here and when they extend they

756
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800

 

757
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,389

the block they push will block out the

758
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
the block they push will block out the
 

759
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,710
the block they push will block out the
light from the glowstone

760
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
light from the glowstone
 

761
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,390
light from the glowstone
like that and it becomes dark in the

762
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
like that and it becomes dark in the
 

763
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,390
like that and it becomes dark in the
room when that happens

764
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400

 

765
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,429

okay so that's the lighting and i'll

766
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
okay so that's the lighting and i'll
 

767
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,870
okay so that's the lighting and i'll
have to run wire on the outside to

768
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
have to run wire on the outside to
 

769
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,909
have to run wire on the outside to
connect them all together

770
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
connect them all together
 

771
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,710
connect them all together
next we'll do the water stream here so

772
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
next we'll do the water stream here so
 

773
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,309
next we'll do the water stream here so
this uh it's an eight by eight room so

774
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
this uh it's an eight by eight room so
 

775
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,750
this uh it's an eight by eight room so
the water ends up going

776
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
the water ends up going
 

777
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,029
the water ends up going
all the way to the very end here

778
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
all the way to the very end here
 

779
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,070
all the way to the very end here
it'll push the skeletons this way and

780
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
it'll push the skeletons this way and
 

781
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,950
it'll push the skeletons this way and
i'll have water

782
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
i'll have water
 

783
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,430
i'll have water
all along i guess i can go ahead and do

784
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
all along i guess i can go ahead and do
 

785
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,909
all along i guess i can go ahead and do
that actually

786
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
that actually
 

787
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,110
that actually
i think oh

788
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
i think oh
 

789
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,830
i think oh
you know i'm gonna put the pistons in

790
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
you know i'm gonna put the pistons in
 

791
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,029
you know i'm gonna put the pistons in
first give me one sec

792
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039

 

793
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,190

i got the roof on it now and we're going

794
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
i got the roof on it now and we're going
 

795
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,830
i got the roof on it now and we're going
to be trying to get the skeletons to

796
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
to be trying to get the skeletons to
 

797
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,669
to be trying to get the skeletons to
this corner i think and

798
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
this corner i think and
 

799
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,630
this corner i think and
should be really easy to do pistons are

800
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
should be really easy to do pistons are
 

801
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,830
should be really easy to do pistons are
in place as well

802
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
in place as well
 

803
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,190
in place as well
so i'm going to go ahead and put the

804
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
so i'm going to go ahead and put the
 

805
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,029
so i'm going to go ahead and put the
water in i guess

806
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
water in i guess
 

807
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,230
water in i guess
put it against this wall we'll do a

808
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
put it against this wall we'll do a
 

809
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,710
put it against this wall we'll do a
stream all the way across

810
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
stream all the way across
 

811
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,190
stream all the way across
like that that will push the skeletons

812
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
like that that will push the skeletons
 

813
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,630
like that that will push the skeletons
to the side over here

814
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
to the side over here
 

815
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,750
to the side over here
um let me polish this up before we

816
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
um let me polish this up before we
 

817
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,669
um let me polish this up before we
finish this this shovel is pretty cool

818
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
finish this this shovel is pretty cool
 

819
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,870
finish this this shovel is pretty cool
efficiency the efficiency for one

820
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
efficiency the efficiency for one
 

821
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,230
efficiency the efficiency for one
i like it it's quick

822
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240

 

823
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,510

okay we'll do that

824
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520

 

825
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,909

and uh we said that corner so i'm gonna

826
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
and uh we said that corner so i'm gonna
 

827
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,070
and uh we said that corner so i'm gonna
put water over here

828
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
put water over here
 

829
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,789
put water over here
and then that will push the skeletons

830
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
and then that will push the skeletons
 

831
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,150
and then that will push the skeletons
that way

832
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
that way
 

833
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,669
that way
i guess we gotta convert this yet

834
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679

 

835
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,950

i better hurry up or else we're not

836
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
i better hurry up or else we're not
 

837
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,110
i better hurry up or else we're not
gonna get to the

838
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
gonna get to the
 

839
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,029
gonna get to the
wheat farm today

840
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039

 

841
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,710

okay i'm showing this because a lot of

842
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
okay i'm showing this because a lot of
 

843
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,110
okay i'm showing this because a lot of
people ask me how i do these uh

844
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
people ask me how i do these uh
 

845
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,029
people ask me how i do these uh
spawner trap things

846
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
spawner trap things
 

847
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,190
spawner trap things
all right so that will take them to this

848
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
all right so that will take them to this
 

849
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,510
all right so that will take them to this
corner and then we will go in one more

850
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
corner and then we will go in one more
 

851
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,710
corner and then we will go in one more
block

852
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
block
 

853
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,870
block
that's as far as the water extends and

854
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
that's as far as the water extends and
 

855
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,350
that's as far as the water extends and
this is where

856
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
this is where
 

857
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,029
this is where
we will go up and that will take the

858
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
we will go up and that will take the
 

859
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,750
we will go up and that will take the
skeletons up here up a mob evader

860
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
skeletons up here up a mob evader
 

861
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,950
skeletons up here up a mob evader
type thing so we'll

862
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
type thing so we'll
 

863
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,150
type thing so we'll
polish this up

864
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160

 

865
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,669

so to do that we're going to take

866
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
so to do that we're going to take
 

867
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,150
so to do that we're going to take
advantage of the skeletons heights

868
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
advantage of the skeletons heights
 

869
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,789
advantage of the skeletons heights
them being two blocks tall and their

870
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
them being two blocks tall and their
 

871
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,750
them being two blocks tall and their
ability to swim in water

872
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
ability to swim in water
 

873
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,630
ability to swim in water
so how do we do that again i think yeah

874
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
so how do we do that again i think yeah
 

875
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,830
so how do we do that again i think yeah
put a pressure plate here

876
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
put a pressure plate here
 

877
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,950
put a pressure plate here
and then water above uh we'll need a

878
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
and then water above uh we'll need a
 

879
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,590
and then water above uh we'll need a
sign

880
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
sign
 

881
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,270
sign
here

882
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280

 

883
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,070

put that there and you have two block

884
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
put that there and you have two block
 

885
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,950
put that there and you have two block
high clearance to get in there

886
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
high clearance to get in there
 

887
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,789
high clearance to get in there
so oh you know what

888
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
so oh you know what
 

889
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,390
so oh you know what
if we do that though then they will

890
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
if we do that though then they will
 

891
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,830
if we do that though then they will
push against here we can't have that

892
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
push against here we can't have that
 

893
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,950
push against here we can't have that
don't make a ton of these things

894
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
don't make a ton of these things
 

895
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,149
don't make a ton of these things
uh what should we do instead i guess

896
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159

 

897
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,830

go down one block maybe and then we'll

898
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:32,840
go down one block maybe and then we'll
 

899
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,230
go down one block maybe and then we'll
go

900
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
go
 

901
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:44,149
go
this way a little bit

902
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159

 

903
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,230

and then we will have another water

904
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
and then we will have another water
 

905
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,870
and then we will have another water
stream here

906
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
stream here
 

907
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,950
stream here
i guess we don't need to push him that

908
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
i guess we don't need to push him that
 

909
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,430
i guess we don't need to push him that
far really

910
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
far really
 

911
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,350
far really
refill that well

912
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
refill that well
 

913
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,310
refill that well
i'll make him go up here a little bit

914
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
i'll make him go up here a little bit
 

915
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,310
i'll make him go up here a little bit
aways from the spawning room

916
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320

 

917
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,990

okay so now

918
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000

 

919
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,510

i need a pressure plate here

920
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520

 

921
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,750

uh give me a second i'll it'll take me a

922
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
uh give me a second i'll it'll take me a
 

923
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,390
uh give me a second i'll it'll take me a
while to do this probably

924
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400

 

925
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,549

i really don't like being in this hole

926
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
i really don't like being in this hole
 

927
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,950
i really don't like being in this hole
at night

928
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
at night
 

929
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,830
at night
creepers can come down at any moment and

930
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
creepers can come down at any moment and
 

931
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,950
creepers can come down at any moment and
then they seem to be

932
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
then they seem to be
 

933
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,750
then they seem to be
always around

934
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
always around
 

935
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,750
always around
okay so all the torches are out of here

936
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
okay so all the torches are out of here
 

937
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,390
okay so all the torches are out of here
and you can see they're not spawning

938
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
and you can see they're not spawning
 

939
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,430
and you can see they're not spawning
and we have all the space utilized that

940
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
and we have all the space utilized that
 

941
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,549
and we have all the space utilized that
they can spawn in

942
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
they can spawn in
 

943
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,710
they can spawn in
so it's pretty pretty good here uh

944
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
so it's pretty pretty good here uh
 

945
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,710
so it's pretty pretty good here uh
they'll go to the side then this corner

946
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
they'll go to the side then this corner
 

947
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,789
they'll go to the side then this corner
they'll fall down

948
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
they'll fall down
 

949
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,470
they'll fall down
this stream will pull them a little ways

950
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
this stream will pull them a little ways
 

951
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,909
this stream will pull them a little ways
away

952
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
away
 

953
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,549
away
doesn't really matter how far uh i'll

954
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
doesn't really matter how far uh i'll
 

955
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,230
doesn't really matter how far uh i'll
put a pressure plate here to block the

956
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
put a pressure plate here to block the
 

957
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,430
put a pressure plate here to block the
water

958
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
water
 

959
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,029
water
could use a sign here too with this

960
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
could use a sign here too with this
 

961
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,190
could use a sign here too with this
block it doesn't really matter

962
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
block it doesn't really matter
 

963
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,549
block it doesn't really matter
i'll put a sign over here to hold water

964
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
i'll put a sign over here to hold water
 

965
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,549
i'll put a sign over here to hold water
as well

966
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
as well
 

967
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,470
as well
and then oh i hated that ladder change

968
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
and then oh i hated that ladder change
 

969
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,710
and then oh i hated that ladder change
so much you have no idea i'm so glad

970
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
so much you have no idea i'm so glad
 

971
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,470
so much you have no idea i'm so glad
they're changing it back

972
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480

 

973
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,230

i actually died a few times from it

974
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240

 

975
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,149

just because they're so messed up now

976
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
just because they're so messed up now
 

977
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,750
just because they're so messed up now
anyway

978
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
anyway
 

979
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,190
anyway
uh what we'll need to do here

980
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
uh what we'll need to do here
 

981
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,549
uh what we'll need to do here
or what i would recommend is to make

982
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
or what i would recommend is to make
 

983
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,070
or what i would recommend is to make
the the water you place here flow

984
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
the the water you place here flow
 

985
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,270
the the water you place here flow
towards this wall or towards

986
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
towards this wall or towards
 

987
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,950
towards this wall or towards
this direction because uh

988
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
this direction because uh
 

989
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,070
this direction because uh
if you just have a flip box there and

990
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
if you just have a flip box there and
 

991
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,190
if you just have a flip box there and
you just have a still water block here

992
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
you just have a still water block here
 

993
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,110
you just have a still water block here
uh you might have

994
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
uh you might have
 

995
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,990
uh you might have
well i might not know what i'm talking

996
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
well i might not know what i'm talking
 

997
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,669
well i might not know what i'm talking
about here

998
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
about here
 

999
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,310
about here
it's possible the skeletons might try to

1000
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
it's possible the skeletons might try to
 

1001
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,990
it's possible the skeletons might try to
swim up and then get stuck on the block

1002
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
swim up and then get stuck on the block
 

1003
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,190
swim up and then get stuck on the block
above

1004
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
above
 

1005
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,870
above
maybe

1006
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880

 

1007
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,230

probably not actually

1008
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
probably not actually
 

1009
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,510
probably not actually
it's hard to see anyway to be sure

1010
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
it's hard to see anyway to be sure
 

1011
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,310
it's hard to see anyway to be sure
just remove that block then do this then

1012
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
just remove that block then do this then
 

1013
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,669
just remove that block then do this then
there'll be a water stream that pulls

1014
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
there'll be a water stream that pulls
 

1015
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,190
there'll be a water stream that pulls
them against this wall

1016
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
them against this wall
 

1017
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,590
them against this wall
so they for sure won't hit get stuck on

1018
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
so they for sure won't hit get stuck on
 

1019
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,430
so they for sure won't hit get stuck on
the block above here

1020
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
the block above here
 

1021
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,549
the block above here
okay

1022
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559

 

1023
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,430

1127
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,710

hmm i've been trying to figure out where

1128
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
hmm i've been trying to figure out where
 

1129
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,549
hmm i've been trying to figure out where
to put the wheat farm but i don't have a

1130
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
to put the wheat farm but i don't have a
 

1131
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,470
to put the wheat farm but i don't have a
whole lot to

1132
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
whole lot to
 

1133
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,070
whole lot to
work off of here so i think i'm just

1134
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
work off of here so i think i'm just
 

1135
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,350
work off of here so i think i'm just
going to put it over here somewhere

1136
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
going to put it over here somewhere
 

1137
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,590
going to put it over here somewhere
and i would have liked to build it out

1138
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
and i would have liked to build it out
 

1139
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,549
and i would have liked to build it out
of bricks but i don't have any so

1140
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
of bricks but i don't have any so
 

1141
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,350
of bricks but i don't have any so
i might try another brick don't know how

1142
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
i might try another brick don't know how
 

1143
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,110
i might try another brick don't know how
to look

1144
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
to look
 

1145
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,510
to look
so i think i'm going to build most of it

1146
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
so i think i'm going to build most of it
 

1147
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,470
so i think i'm going to build most of it
off camera

1148
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
off camera
 

1149
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,310
