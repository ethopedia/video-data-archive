and I haven't really done anything since
 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,099
and I haven't really done anything since
last episode because I haven't had time

to so let's get to work
 

13
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,950
to so let's get to work
I was really secretive last episode

14
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:21,960
I was really secretive last episode
 

15
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,349
I was really secretive last episode
about what I'm doing here so I'll just

16
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:24,359
about what I'm doing here so I'll just
 

17
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,490
about what I'm doing here so I'll just
give you a quick explanation of things

give you a quick explanation of things
 

19
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,960
give you a quick explanation of things
this wall I'm leaving blank at the

20
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:29,970
this wall I'm leaving blank at the
 

21
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,269
this wall I'm leaving blank at the
moment because I'm going to be putting

22
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
moment because I'm going to be putting
 

23
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,560
moment because I'm going to be putting
the squid aquarium here so all my squid

24
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:36,570
the squid aquarium here so all my squid
 

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,209
the squid aquarium here so all my squid
are gonna collect to some sort of

26
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:38,219
are gonna collect to some sort of
 

27
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,979
are gonna collect to some sort of
aquarium here inside here is where

28
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:42,989
aquarium here inside here is where
 

29
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,160
aquarium here inside here is where
wolves are gonna be stored and if I want

30
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,170
wolves are gonna be stored and if I want
 

31
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,660
wolves are gonna be stored and if I want
I can come into my barn and tame them I

32
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:52,670
I can come into my barn and tame them I
 

33
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,180
I can come into my barn and tame them I
might create a storage system to for

34
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,190
might create a storage system to for
 

35
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,580
might create a storage system to for
them somewhere eventually so by the time

36
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,590
them somewhere eventually so by the time
 

37
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,650
them somewhere eventually so by the time
the animals come to the barn I've

38
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:03,660
the animals come to the barn I've
 

39
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,170
the animals come to the barn I've
decided that I want to store them here

40
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,180

 

41
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,450

so the sheep-shearing if I do that will

42
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:11,460
so the sheep-shearing if I do that will
 

43
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,340
so the sheep-shearing if I do that will
be will happen sooner and I will have an

44
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,350
be will happen sooner and I will have an
 

45
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,700
be will happen sooner and I will have an
option to either shear them somewhere

46
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:19,710
option to either shear them somewhere
 

47
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,310
option to either shear them somewhere
over there or else have them run all the

48
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
over there or else have them run all the
 

49
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,600
over there or else have them run all the
way over here and sheared and these

50
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,610
way over here and sheared and these
 

51
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,990
way over here and sheared and these
platforms these blocks these sandstone

52
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
platforms these blocks these sandstone
 

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
platforms these blocks these sandstone
blocks are where the cows and sheep are

54
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:32,670
blocks are where the cows and sheep are
 

55
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,300
blocks are where the cows and sheep are
going to be stored and I can come in

56
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,310
going to be stored and I can come in
 

57
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,550
going to be stored and I can come in
here and die sheep if I want or milk

58
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
here and die sheep if I want or milk
 

59
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,090
here and die sheep if I want or milk
cows or or just look at them and laugh

60
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,100
cows or or just look at them and laugh
 

61
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,330
cows or or just look at them and laugh
it's up to me so the trick here that I'm

62
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,340
it's up to me so the trick here that I'm
 

63
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,420
it's up to me so the trick here that I'm
going to be doing is separating them so

64
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,430
going to be doing is separating them so
 

65
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,899
going to be doing is separating them so
only one sheep and one or one cow will

66
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:53,909
only one sheep and one or one cow will
 

67
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,660
only one sheep and one or one cow will
be on each of these platforms is my goal

68
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,670
be on each of these platforms is my goal
 

69
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:05,319
be on each of these platforms is my goal
so to do this I came up with a trick

70
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:05,329
so to do this I came up with a trick
 

71
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,880
so to do this I came up with a trick
when making the record studio I've

72
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:07,890
when making the record studio I've
 

73
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,670
when making the record studio I've
discovered it when I was trying to

74
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,680
discovered it when I was trying to
 

75
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,280
discovered it when I was trying to
let's see where do I want when I was

76
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,290
let's see where do I want when I was
 

77
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,580
let's see where do I want when I was
trying to separate the skeleton so they

78
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,590
trying to separate the skeleton so they
 

79
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,150
trying to separate the skeleton so they
wouldn't shoot each other that's gonna

80
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,160
wouldn't shoot each other that's gonna
 

81
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,290
wouldn't shoot each other that's gonna
put them each into their own holding

82
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,300
put them each into their own holding
 

83
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,410
put them each into their own holding
area but that didn't work because more

84
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,420
area but that didn't work because more
 

85
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,480
area but that didn't work because more
than one skeleton can fit in a one by

86
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,490
than one skeleton can fit in a one by
 

87
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,310
than one skeleton can fit in a one by
one area so I just abandoned that but

88
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,320
one area so I just abandoned that but
 

89
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,260
one area so I just abandoned that but
for this I think it'll work because

90
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,270
for this I think it'll work because
 

91
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,740
for this I think it'll work because
cheaper fatter than skeletons and other

92
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,750
cheaper fatter than skeletons and other
 

93
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,600
cheaper fatter than skeletons and other
tall mops and so are cows

94
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,610

 

95
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,890

actually no I'm just gonna fill the

96
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
actually no I'm just gonna fill the
 

97
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,190
actually no I'm just gonna fill the
solid and then break out the blocks I

98
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
solid and then break out the blocks I
 

99
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:10,699
solid and then break out the blocks I
don't want and I'm making this three

100
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:10,709
don't want and I'm making this three
 

101
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,350
don't want and I'm making this three
high just so it's not so claustrophobic

102
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:12,360
high just so it's not so claustrophobic
 

103
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,290
high just so it's not so claustrophobic
in here this might cause a problem later

104
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,300
in here this might cause a problem later
 

105
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:31,880
in here this might cause a problem later
though how's everybody doing how's the

106
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:31,890
though how's everybody doing how's the
 

107
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,160
though how's everybody doing how's the
family

108
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,170
family
 

109
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,220
family
that's good that's good we should get

110
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,230
that's good that's good we should get
 

111
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,440
that's good that's good we should get
together sometime

112
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,450

 

113
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,320

okay okay I'm gonna finish this up this

114
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,330
okay okay I'm gonna finish this up this
 

115
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,990
okay okay I'm gonna finish this up this
is getting boring okay I got that done

116
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
is getting boring okay I got that done
 

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,050
is getting boring okay I got that done
now um I shouldn't add one here in all

118
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,060
now um I shouldn't add one here in all
 

119
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,430
now um I shouldn't add one here in all
the corners you figure out how this

120
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:06,440
the corners you figure out how this
 

121
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,240
the corners you figure out how this
works yet I'll hopefully explain it

122
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,250
works yet I'll hopefully explain it
 

123
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,800
works yet I'll hopefully explain it
better in just a little bit

124
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:11,810
better in just a little bit
 

125
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,570
better in just a little bit
oh okay so we need to run blocks all the

126
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:19,580
oh okay so we need to run blocks all the
 

127
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:34,530
oh okay so we need to run blocks all the
way around and there's gonna be a wall

128
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:34,540
way around and there's gonna be a wall
 

129
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,190
way around and there's gonna be a wall
for the sheep and cows to walk into

130
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,200
for the sheep and cows to walk into
 

131
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,630
for the sheep and cows to walk into
that's what I'm adding here that will

132
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:43,640
that's what I'm adding here that will
 

133
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
that's what I'm adding here that will
help align them properly select they'll

134
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:45,650
help align them properly select they'll
 

135
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:53,140
help align them properly select they'll
fall down these holes but since I made

136
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,150
fall down these holes but since I made
 

137
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,409
fall down these holes but since I made
this soups well I'm gonna finish this

138
00:04:59,409 --> 00:04:59,419
this soups well I'm gonna finish this
 

139
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,030
this soups well I'm gonna finish this
first and I'll say what I was going to

140
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,040
first and I'll say what I was going to
 

141
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,850
first and I'll say what I was going to
say okay there since I made this three

142
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:06,860
say okay there since I made this three
 

143
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,520
say okay there since I made this three
hi I really should probably make it too

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,530
hi I really should probably make it too
 

145
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,760
hi I really should probably make it too
high but I just don't want the ceilings

146
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:12,770
high but I just don't want the ceilings
 

147
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,730
high but I just don't want the ceilings
so low I'm gonna have to raise these a

148
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:15,740
so low I'm gonna have to raise these a
 

149
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,320
so low I'm gonna have to raise these a
block and I think I'm just gonna put

150
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,330
block and I think I'm just gonna put
 

151
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:27,520
block and I think I'm just gonna put
glass on top of all of these so mob

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,530
glass on top of all of these so mob
 

153
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,510
glass on top of all of these so mob
stand job excuse me mobs can jump one

154
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
stand job excuse me mobs can jump one
 

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,070
stand job excuse me mobs can jump one
block they can't jump a block and a half

156
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,080
block they can't jump a block and a half
 

157
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
block they can't jump a block and a half
in height so that's kind of the

158
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,090
in height so that's kind of the
 

159
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,210
in height so that's kind of the
principle behind this

160
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,220

 

161
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,070

that's one full block but we have an

162
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
that's one full block but we have an
 

163
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,960
that's one full block but we have an
extra half block here so they won't be

164
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:46,970
extra half block here so they won't be
 

165
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,090
extra half block here so they won't be
able to jump out of these holes once

166
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,100
able to jump out of these holes once
 

167
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,410
able to jump out of these holes once
they fall in them

168
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,420

 

169
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:00,250

so that's one important key to this the

170
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:00,260
so that's one important key to this the
 

171
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,920
so that's one important key to this the
other key is since they'll probably be

172
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:02,930
other key is since they'll probably be
 

173
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,930
other key is since they'll probably be
jumping around here if another sheep

174
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:04,940
jumping around here if another sheep
 

175
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,980
jumping around here if another sheep
tries to walk into the same hole or a

176
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:08,990
tries to walk into the same hole or a
 

177
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,810
tries to walk into the same hole or a
sheep or cows tries to walking in the

178
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:10,820
sheep or cows tries to walking in the
 

179
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,070
sheep or cows tries to walking in the
same hole as another animal they're

180
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,080
same hole as another animal they're
 

181
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
same hole as another animal they're
jumping around we'll bump the sheet back

182
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:17,810
jumping around we'll bump the sheet back
 

183
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,110
jumping around we'll bump the sheet back
and they won't be able to fall down the

184
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,120
and they won't be able to fall down the
 

185
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,890
and they won't be able to fall down the
hole as well so that's the other key to

186
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:23,900
hole as well so that's the other key to
 

187
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,710
hole as well so that's the other key to
this so they'll just randomly walk

188
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
this so they'll just randomly walk
 

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,270
this so they'll just randomly walk
around here and eventually they'll fall

190
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,280
around here and eventually they'll fall
 

191
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,470
around here and eventually they'll fall
into one of these holes that's free

192
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:31,480
into one of these holes that's free
 

193
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,540
into one of these holes that's free
hopefully again I haven't tested this to

194
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,550
hopefully again I haven't tested this to
 

195
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,030
hopefully again I haven't tested this to
see if it actually works

196
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,040
see if it actually works
 

197
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,650
see if it actually works
and I'm gonna be pretty mad if it

198
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:38,660
and I'm gonna be pretty mad if it
 

199
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,220
and I'm gonna be pretty mad if it
doesn't I'm not mad but you know upset

200
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,230
doesn't I'm not mad but you know upset
 

201
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:58,090
doesn't I'm not mad but you know upset
I might even rage quit so I'm just

202
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,100
I might even rage quit so I'm just
 

203
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:10,930
I might even rage quit so I'm just
making making the wall here okay now I

204
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:10,940
making making the wall here okay now I
 

205
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,010
making making the wall here okay now I
think I'm just gonna add an inside thing

206
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,020
think I'm just gonna add an inside thing
 

207
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,690
think I'm just gonna add an inside thing
here too and then I'll probably make the

208
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:19,700
here too and then I'll probably make the
 

209
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,460
here too and then I'll probably make the
rest glass so I can see them walking

210
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,470
rest glass so I can see them walking
 

211
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,220
rest glass so I can see them walking
around up here and so I'm gonna run that

212
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,230
around up here and so I'm gonna run that
 

213
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,720
around up here and so I'm gonna run that
tube over there all the way here and

214
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:30,730
tube over there all the way here and
 

215
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,730
tube over there all the way here and
it's gonna land it's gonna drop them on

216
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:33,740
it's gonna land it's gonna drop them on
 

217
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,420
it's gonna land it's gonna drop them on
to this level I'm making right now

218
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,430

 

219
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,420

and the Wolves are gonna their pipe is

220
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,430
and the Wolves are gonna their pipe is
 

221
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,510
and the Wolves are gonna their pipe is
over there there I think not over there

222
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
over there there I think not over there
 

223
00:07:49,520 --> 00:08:05,350
over there there I think not over there
and I have to run that here - whoa leg

224
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360

 

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,120

all right excellent so yeah man probably

226
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,130
all right excellent so yeah man probably
 

227
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:24,980
all right excellent so yeah man probably
put class oh you know what I might want

228
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:24,990
put class oh you know what I might want
 

229
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:35,120
put class oh you know what I might want
to raise it yeah I think I'm actually

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,130
to raise it yeah I think I'm actually
 

231
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,690
to raise it yeah I think I'm actually
going to raise this one block just for

232
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:38,700
going to raise this one block just for
 

233
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:49,430
going to raise this one block just for
looks oh I do not like doing this okay

234
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
looks oh I do not like doing this okay
 

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,020
looks oh I do not like doing this okay
well I'm gonna finish that up off-camera

236
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,030
well I'm gonna finish that up off-camera
 

237
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,420
well I'm gonna finish that up off-camera
because it'll take a while and then

238
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,430
because it'll take a while and then
 

239
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,040
because it'll take a while and then
we'll be back and I might run some of

240
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,050
we'll be back and I might run some of
 

241
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,400
we'll be back and I might run some of
these pipes okay so here's where we're

242
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,410
these pipes okay so here's where we're
 

243
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,780
these pipes okay so here's where we're
at right now I added a glass roof to

244
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:05,790
at right now I added a glass roof to
 

245
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,410
at right now I added a glass roof to
this there's a water break here and

246
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:11,420
this there's a water break here and
 

247
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,090
this there's a water break here and
another water cushion down here for the

248
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,100
another water cushion down here for the
 

249
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,310
another water cushion down here for the
wolfes land and I'll probably be

250
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
wolfes land and I'll probably be
 

251
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,260
wolfes land and I'll probably be
changing this a bit yet because it

252
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,270
changing this a bit yet because it
 

253
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,160
changing this a bit yet because it
doesn't quite look great all right so

254
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,170
doesn't quite look great all right so
 

255
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,560
doesn't quite look great all right so
the sheep and the cows are you're gonna

256
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,570
the sheep and the cows are you're gonna
 

257
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,640
the sheep and the cows are you're gonna
fall down this hole here unfortunately

258
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:31,650
fall down this hole here unfortunately
 

259
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,720
fall down this hole here unfortunately
since I set it up this way there's not

260
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:35,730
since I set it up this way there's not
 

261
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,300
since I set it up this way there's not
an even probability of them falling into

262
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,310
an even probability of them falling into
 

263
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,940
an even probability of them falling into
each of these holes they're more likely

264
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:40,950
each of these holes they're more likely
 

265
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,610
each of these holes they're more likely
to favor this quarter here I think these

266
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:46,620
to favor this quarter here I think these
 

267
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,820
to favor this quarter here I think these
holes in this area here and less likely

268
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:49,830
holes in this area here and less likely
 

269
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,000
holes in this area here and less likely
to favor the ones over here but it's

270
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,010
to favor the ones over here but it's
 

271
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,800
to favor the ones over here but it's
fine they'll walk around and eventually

272
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:57,810
fine they'll walk around and eventually
 

273
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,290
fine they'll walk around and eventually
they'll fill up all the holes the other

274
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:02,300
they'll fill up all the holes the other
 

275
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,180
they'll fill up all the holes the other
pipe here is for the Wolves they'll fall

276
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,190
pipe here is for the Wolves they'll fall
 

277
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,410
pipe here is for the Wolves they'll fall
down

278
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:06,420
down
 

279
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:27,500
down
this from here is the plan so rather

280
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,510
this from here is the plan so rather
 

281
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,509
this from here is the plan so rather
than having a two pipes leading here I'm

282
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
than having a two pipes leading here I'm
 

283
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,269
than having a two pipes leading here I'm
just gonna have one single fat pipe I

284
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:32,279
just gonna have one single fat pipe I
 

285
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:39,670
just gonna have one single fat pipe I
think which will be achieved by making

286
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
think which will be achieved by making
 

287
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:54,740
think which will be achieved by making
it six wide I think it's probably

288
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:54,750
it six wide I think it's probably
 

289
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,439
it six wide I think it's probably
impossible to see now it's dark I have

290
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:00,449
impossible to see now it's dark I have
 

291
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,280
impossible to see now it's dark I have
the other thing we need this to be high

292
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,290
the other thing we need this to be high
 

293
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,920
the other thing we need this to be high
enough I've got a three high clearance

294
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:06,930
enough I've got a three high clearance
 

295
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,420
enough I've got a three high clearance
here so the animals are free to walk

296
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,430
here so the animals are free to walk
 

297
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,129
here so the animals are free to walk
around however they choose without

298
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:10,139
around however they choose without
 

299
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,000
around however they choose without
bumping their heads on anything but

300
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,010
bumping their heads on anything but
 

301
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,250
bumping their heads on anything but
again the problem is this pipe is in the

302
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,260
again the problem is this pipe is in the
 

303
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,639
again the problem is this pipe is in the
way so they will run into it but it

304
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:22,649
way so they will run into it but it
 

305
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,180
way so they will run into it but it
doesn't matter much okay so I'm gonna

306
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,190
doesn't matter much okay so I'm gonna
 

307
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,540
doesn't matter much okay so I'm gonna
run a pipe from here all the way to

308
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,550
run a pipe from here all the way to
 

309
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,639
run a pipe from here all the way to
there and I'm somehow gonna connect the

310
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:31,649
there and I'm somehow gonna connect the
 

311
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,240
there and I'm somehow gonna connect the
wolf pipe and the cow and sheep pipe

312
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,250
wolf pipe and the cow and sheep pipe
 

313
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,730
wolf pipe and the cow and sheep pipe
together here's just a little quick

314
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:40,740
together here's just a little quick
 

315
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,420
together here's just a little quick
update of how it's going and it's a big

316
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,430
update of how it's going and it's a big
 

317
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:54,100
update of how it's going and it's a big
pipe that's for sure wrap around like so

318
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,110
pipe that's for sure wrap around like so
 

319
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,970
pipe that's for sure wrap around like so
so this is one of them this one goes to

320
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:57,980
so this is one of them this one goes to
 

321
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,970
so this is one of them this one goes to
where the wolves go and the path next to

322
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
where the wolves go and the path next to
 

323
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:10,519
where the wolves go and the path next to
it goes to the cow and sheep area so I

324
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:10,529
it goes to the cow and sheep area so I
 

325
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,100
it goes to the cow and sheep area so I
have to hook this one up to this pipe

326
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,110
have to hook this one up to this pipe
 

327
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:21,889
have to hook this one up to this pipe
here somehow and dull give you another

328
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:21,899
here somehow and dull give you another
 

329
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,860
here somehow and dull give you another
update soon alright guy she's mostly all

330
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:27,870
update soon alright guy she's mostly all
 

331
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,050
update soon alright guy she's mostly all
done here now so let's see how this

332
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,060
done here now so let's see how this
 

333
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,920
done here now so let's see how this
works I had a hard time testing this

334
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:36,930
works I had a hard time testing this
 

335
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,679
works I had a hard time testing this
because when a passive mob stop spawning

336
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:39,689
because when a passive mob stop spawning
 

337
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:44,259
because when a passive mob stop spawning
and I can't get them to spawn again aw

338
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:44,269
and I can't get them to spawn again aw
 

339
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:49,219
and I can't get them to spawn again aw
crap

340
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:49,229

 

341
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,239

well I didn't have time to get them

342
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:51,249
well I didn't have time to get them
 

343
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,769
well I didn't have time to get them
working again so I stopped playing

344
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:52,779
working again so I stopped playing
 

345
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,590
working again so I stopped playing
minecraft and I've been busy with work

346
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
minecraft and I've been busy with work
 

347
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,859
minecraft and I've been busy with work
three days later I started minecraft and

348
00:12:58,859 --> 00:12:58,869
three days later I started minecraft and
 

349
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,210
three days later I started minecraft and
they are spawning again so that clip

350
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,220
they are spawning again so that clip
 

351
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,309
they are spawning again so that clip
just seems to fix itself over time as

352
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:05,319
just seems to fix itself over time as
 

353
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:10,169
just seems to fix itself over time as
well because when I left playing

354
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:10,179
well because when I left playing
 

355
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,329
well because when I left playing
minecraft before it wasn't working and

356
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:12,339
minecraft before it wasn't working and
 

357
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,150
minecraft before it wasn't working and
now it is hot dang it which makes me

358
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
now it is hot dang it which makes me
 

359
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,669
now it is hot dang it which makes me
think it's actually programmed into the

360
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:23,679
think it's actually programmed into the
 

361
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,239
think it's actually programmed into the
game on purpose and it's not a glitch is

362
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:27,249
game on purpose and it's not a glitch is
 

363
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:41,479
game on purpose and it's not a glitch is
what I'm thinking now so let's see I

364
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:41,489

 

365
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,210

have a big circle here which is kind of

366
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:45,220
have a big circle here which is kind of
 

367
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,329
have a big circle here which is kind of
a problem because it takes them a lot

368
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:51,339
a problem because it takes them a lot
 

369
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:55,559
a problem because it takes them a lot
longer to fall down the holes if I made

370
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:55,569
longer to fall down the holes if I made
 

371
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,059
longer to fall down the holes if I made
a smaller circle they would fall down

372
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:57,069
a smaller circle they would fall down
 

373
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:04,919
a smaller circle they would fall down
the whole spots sooner and I've added

374
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:04,929
the whole spots sooner and I've added
 

375
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,599
the whole spots sooner and I've added
these soil blocks here because I think

376
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:06,609
these soil blocks here because I think
 

377
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:11,159
these soil blocks here because I think
they slightly helped them to fall down

378
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,169
they slightly helped them to fall down
 

379
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:16,949
they slightly helped them to fall down
easier helps to align them better but

380
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
easier helps to align them better but
 

381
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:30,710
easier helps to align them better but
I'm not sure if it's actually better

382
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720

 

383
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:39,760

yeah they're sure not falling down

384
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:39,770

 

385
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,260

it takes them a while but they do fall

386
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,270
it takes them a while but they do fall
 

387
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,540
it takes them a while but they do fall
down eventually cow just went down so

388
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:47,550
down eventually cow just went down so
 

389
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,950
down eventually cow just went down so
when they fall down they jump for a

390
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:48,960
when they fall down they jump for a
 

391
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,520
when they fall down they jump for a
while but then I noticed they stopped

392
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:52,530
while but then I noticed they stopped
 

393
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,710
while but then I noticed they stopped
jumping so I'm not sure how well this

394
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
jumping so I'm not sure how well this
 

395
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,330
jumping so I'm not sure how well this
actually works I'm gonna add a block

396
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:05,340
actually works I'm gonna add a block
 

397
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,130
actually works I'm gonna add a block
here this will be a block and a half

398
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,140
here this will be a block and a half
 

399
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:23,000
here this will be a block and a half
still so they can still walk in see the

400
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,010
still so they can still walk in see the
 

401
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:31,940
still so they can still walk in see the
F after enough time they fall down so

402
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:31,950
F after enough time they fall down so
 

403
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,400
F after enough time they fall down so
it's kind of a successive project and

404
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,410
it's kind of a successive project and
 

405
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:47,690
it's kind of a successive project and
it's kind of a fail and I think I'm

406
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:47,700
it's kind of a fail and I think I'm
 

407
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,160
it's kind of a fail and I think I'm
gonna add a half slab here I keep

408
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,170
gonna add a half slab here I keep
 

409
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,970
gonna add a half slab here I keep
pressing a scoop until I haven't played

410
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:55,980
pressing a scoop until I haven't played
 

411
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,480
pressing a scoop until I haven't played
Minecraft in a while because when they

412
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,490
Minecraft in a while because when they
 

413
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,650
Minecraft in a while because when they
were falling down they were sometimes

414
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:00,660
were falling down they were sometimes
 

415
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,010
were falling down they were sometimes
taking damage so you still have a block

416
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,020
taking damage so you still have a block
 

417
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,610
taking damage so you still have a block
and a half clearance here but they

418
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:07,620
and a half clearance here but they
 

419
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,410
and a half clearance here but they
shouldn't take damage when they fall now

420
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,420
shouldn't take damage when they fall now
 

421
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,030
shouldn't take damage when they fall now
and can see they have stopped jumping so

422
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
and can see they have stopped jumping so
 

423
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,930
and can see they have stopped jumping so
I think it might be possible for them to

424
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:18,940
I think it might be possible for them to
 

425
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,330
I think it might be possible for them to
walk into the same hole as another

426
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,340
walk into the same hole as another
 

427
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,440
walk into the same hole as another
animal actually because mobs are like

428
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:25,450
animal actually because mobs are like
 

429
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,960
animal actually because mobs are like
the sheep and cows are less than a block

430
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:30,970
the sheep and cows are less than a block
 

431
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,400
the sheep and cows are less than a block
and a half in height so this is kind of

432
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,410
and a half in height so this is kind of
 

433
00:16:35,410 --> 00:17:00,600
and a half in height so this is kind of
level ground here let's go down so the

434
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,610
level ground here let's go down so the
 

435
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,100
level ground here let's go down so the
idea is when they fall like this they

436
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,110
idea is when they fall like this they
 

437
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,050
idea is when they fall like this they
would automatically fall into their

438
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,060
would automatically fall into their
 

439
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,660
would automatically fall into their
little separate things on their own

440
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:09,670
little separate things on their own
 

441
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,689
little separate things on their own
automatically and then when we come to

442
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:12,699
automatically and then when we come to
 

443
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,410
automatically and then when we come to
the burn these things were all supposed

444
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:16,420
the burn these things were all supposed
 

445
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,550
the burn these things were all supposed
to be full and we could milk the cows if

446
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:20,560
to be full and we could milk the cows if
 

447
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:31,830
to be full and we could milk the cows if
we want if they give us milk why am I

448
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
we want if they give us milk why am I
 

449
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,250
we want if they give us milk why am I
not getting milk oh I had some I had

450
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,260
not getting milk oh I had some I had
 

451
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,600
not getting milk oh I had some I had
some three four five six seven eight

452
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:42,610
some three four five six seven eight
 

453
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,040
some three four five six seven eight
nine ten

454
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,050
nine ten
 

455
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:58,070
nine ten
give me your milk

456
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080

 

457
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:07,920

that's weird what am I doing wrong here

458
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:07,930
that's weird what am I doing wrong here
 

459
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,450
that's weird what am I doing wrong here
guys I thought I'd get milk doing this I

460
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
guys I thought I'd get milk doing this I
 

461
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,920
guys I thought I'd get milk doing this I
didn't have some when I was clicking

462
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:13,930
didn't have some when I was clicking
 

463
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:24,750
didn't have some when I was clicking
this Jack okay well anyway and the other

464
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:24,760
this Jack okay well anyway and the other
 

465
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,260
this Jack okay well anyway and the other
thing is we would be able to dye the

466
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,270
thing is we would be able to dye the
 

467
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,060
thing is we would be able to dye the
sheep when we come in here and then we

468
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,070
sheep when we come in here and then we
 

469
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,700
sheep when we come in here and then we
can hit them their wool Falls neatly on

470
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:35,710
can hit them their wool Falls neatly on
 

471
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,120
can hit them their wool Falls neatly on
these little blocks here and my other

472
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,130
these little blocks here and my other
 

473
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,820
these little blocks here and my other
idea was the Wolves land in here if the

474
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:44,830
idea was the Wolves land in here if the
 

475
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,940
idea was the Wolves land in here if the
doors are open that they would be able

476
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:47,950
doors are open that they would be able
 

477
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,190
doors are open that they would be able
to free roam in this barn and kill the

478
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,200
to free roam in this barn and kill the
 

479
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,490
to free roam in this barn and kill the
Sheep automatically as well but I think

480
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:53,500
Sheep automatically as well but I think
 

481
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,010
Sheep automatically as well but I think
that she might be too high now for them

482
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,020
that she might be too high now for them
 

483
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,160
that she might be too high now for them
to do that I don't know because I

484
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170
to do that I don't know because I
 

485
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:18,660
to do that I don't know because I
haven't seen any wolves yet

486
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:18,670

 

487
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,240

let's look at the the piping here how it

488
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,250
let's look at the the piping here how it
 

489
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,560
let's look at the the piping here how it
is okay this is where the wolf separator

490
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:28,570
is okay this is where the wolf separator
 

491
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:35,280
is okay this is where the wolf separator
is guys they come and then it's before

492
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,290
is guys they come and then it's before
 

493
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,660
is guys they come and then it's before
it would keep going straight here I

494
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:36,670
it would keep going straight here I
 

495
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,270
it would keep going straight here I
removed all that instead it goes the

496
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
removed all that instead it goes the
 

497
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,360
removed all that instead it goes the
right here now and it goes up this

498
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,370
right here now and it goes up this
 

499
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,490
right here now and it goes up this
little staircase thing no dead zones

500
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:46,500
little staircase thing no dead zones
 

501
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:56,450
little staircase thing no dead zones
this is for the Wolves goes goes goes

502
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:56,460

 

503
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:05,669

and then they fall down and the Sheep

504
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
and then they fall down and the Sheep
 

505
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,840
and then they fall down and the Sheep
one I just I shortened the pipe there

506
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:09,850
one I just I shortened the pipe there
 

507
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,419
one I just I shortened the pipe there
and made it go off here they fall down

508
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:12,429
and made it go off here they fall down
 

509
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,070
and made it go off here they fall down
there's a water break so they don't take

510
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
there's a water break so they don't take
 

511
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,210
there's a water break so they don't take
fall damage and then this dream takes

512
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,220
fall damage and then this dream takes
 

513
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,460
fall damage and then this dream takes
them along again with no dead zones

514
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,470
them along again with no dead zones
 

515
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,409
them along again with no dead zones
which is important and that's basically

516
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:25,419
which is important and that's basically
 

517
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:31,830
which is important and that's basically
how it works and the barn is close

518
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
how it works and the barn is close
 

519
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,960
how it works and the barn is close
enough to my storage room that I'll

520
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:33,970
enough to my storage room that I'll
 

521
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,400
enough to my storage room that I'll
likely be within 32 blocks of these guys

522
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,410
likely be within 32 blocks of these guys
 

523
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,070
likely be within 32 blocks of these guys
so they won't despawn as I'm doing stuff

524
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,080
so they won't despawn as I'm doing stuff
 

525
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:49,570
so they won't despawn as I'm doing stuff
away from here which is also important

526
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:49,580

 

527
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,060

but I'm gonna keep tweeting this again

528
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,070
but I'm gonna keep tweeting this again
 

529
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,230
but I'm gonna keep tweeting this again
it would work better if I made it

530
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
it would work better if I made it
 

531
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,900
it would work better if I made it
smaller which it does seem to be pretty

532
00:20:59,900 --> 00:20:59,910
smaller which it does seem to be pretty
 

533
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,090
smaller which it does seem to be pretty
random though like which holes they fall

534
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,100
random though like which holes they fall
 

535
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,410
random though like which holes they fall
in despite this pipe in the middle and

536
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:09,420
in despite this pipe in the middle and
 

537
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,440
in despite this pipe in the middle and
yeah that's that's what I've been

538
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,450
yeah that's that's what I've been
 

539
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,400
yeah that's that's what I've been
building guys so eventually I'm going to

540
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,410
building guys so eventually I'm going to
 

541
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:22,160
building guys so eventually I'm going to
build this width arm I don't like that I

542
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,170
build this width arm I don't like that I
 

543
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,610
build this width arm I don't like that I
can't get out of here now I'll probably

544
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:25,620
can't get out of here now I'll probably
 

545
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,020
can't get out of here now I'll probably
make a passage up here too so that it

546
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,030
make a passage up here too so that it
 

547
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,130
make a passage up here too so that it
can come and walk in this area and I'll

548
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,140
can come and walk in this area and I'll
 

549
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:46,520
can come and walk in this area and I'll
have it covered too yet yeah so the Swit

550
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,530
have it covered too yet yeah so the Swit
 

551
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,850
have it covered too yet yeah so the Swit
farm goes here and I'll probably have a

552
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:49,860
farm goes here and I'll probably have a
 

553
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,650
farm goes here and I'll probably have a
walkway somewhere around here so I can

554
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:51,660
walkway somewhere around here so I can
 

555
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,740
walkway somewhere around here so I can
go up to the next level here and that is

556
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:57,750
go up to the next level here and that is
 

557
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,640
go up to the next level here and that is
the plan guys so thank you for watching

558
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:01,650
the plan guys so thank you for watching
 

559
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,400
the plan guys so thank you for watching
if you got ideas let me know I'll be

560
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,410
if you got ideas let me know I'll be
 

561
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,790
if you got ideas let me know I'll be
tweaking this to make it better and this

562
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:07,800
tweaking this to make it better and this
 

563
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,950
tweaking this to make it better and this
wolf thing doesn't look very good so

564
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:09,960
wolf thing doesn't look very good so
 

565
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,890
wolf thing doesn't look very good so
I'll be changing it as well I might even

566
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:12,900
I'll be changing it as well I might even
 

567
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,720
I'll be changing it as well I might even
get rid of these doors I don't know and

568
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:16,730
get rid of these doors I don't know and
 

569
