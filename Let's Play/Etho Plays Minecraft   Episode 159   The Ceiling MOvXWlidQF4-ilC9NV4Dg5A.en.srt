00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,630
all around here which is pretty much
there already

176
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
there already
 

177
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,550
there already
and then this was going to be netherrack

178
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
and then this was going to be netherrack
 

179
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,429
and then this was going to be netherrack
kind of beveled up a little bit

180
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
kind of beveled up a little bit
 

181
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,070
kind of beveled up a little bit
i'm worried it's going to be too dark if

201
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,030

so instead of having a square corner

202
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
so instead of having a square corner
 

203
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,070
so instead of having a square corner
maybe we'll do this instead

204
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080

 

205
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,390

like that just a little bit more round

206
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
like that just a little bit more round
 

207
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,710
like that just a little bit more round
um yeah this is going to be tough

208
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
um yeah this is going to be tough
 

209
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,510
um yeah this is going to be tough
to shape because it's kind of

210
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
to shape because it's kind of
 

211
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,670
to shape because it's kind of
kind of goes down in places goes up in

212
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
kind of goes down in places goes up in
 

213
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,070
kind of goes down in places goes up in
places some places are really wide some

214
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
places some places are really wide some
 

215
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,710
places some places are really wide some
are really

216
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
are really
 

217
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,150
are really
narrow like this isn't exactly a wide

218
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
narrow like this isn't exactly a wide
 

219
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,390
narrow like this isn't exactly a wide
area here

220
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
area here
 

221
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,590
area here
but i don't know i'll try and

222
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
but i don't know i'll try and
 

223
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,189
but i don't know i'll try and
hopefully it won't look terrible and i

224
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
hopefully it won't look terrible and i
 

225
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,510
hopefully it won't look terrible and i
don't know what to do about over here

226

don't know what to do about over here
 

227
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,710
don't know what to do about over here
because we got the the path for the cave

228
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
because we got the the path for the cave
 

229
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,070
because we got the the path for the cave
spiders

230
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
spiders
 

231
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,830
spiders
where the stone brick is it's kind of

232
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
where the stone brick is it's kind of
 

233
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,990
where the stone brick is it's kind of
important

234
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
important
 

235
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,990
important
but i guess we'll just have to figure

236
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
but i guess we'll just have to figure
 

237
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,510
but i guess we'll just have to figure
something out

238
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
something out
 

239
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,909
something out
so i'm gonna go ahead and we'll see what

240
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
so i'm gonna go ahead and we'll see what
 

241
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,029
so i'm gonna go ahead and we'll see what
it looks like

been made
 

247
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,710

257
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,870

i think we can live with it

258
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880

 

259

346
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
room door just because they kept opening
 

347
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,350
room door just because they kept opening
and closing whenever i opened and closed

348

and closing whenever i opened and closed
 

349
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,350
and closing whenever i opened and closed
the door and i didn't feel like moving

350
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
the door and i didn't feel like moving
 

351
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,830
the door and i didn't feel like moving
the

352
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
the
 

353
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,670
the
wire around anyway back to the ceiling

354
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
wire around anyway back to the ceiling
 

355
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,469
wire around anyway back to the ceiling
so that goes around

356
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
so that goes around
 

357
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,830
so that goes around
uh i replaced remember i used to just

358
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
uh i replaced remember i used to just
 

359
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,430
uh i replaced remember i used to just
have the stone brick stairs here and i

360
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
have the stone brick stairs here and i
 

361
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,869
have the stone brick stairs here and i
had like a

362
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
had like a
 

363
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,830
had like a
quarter gap and then above that there

364
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
quarter gap and then above that there
 

365
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,430
quarter gap and then above that there
was the full

366
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
was the full
 

367
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,350
was the full
nether brick blocks now i have nether

368
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
nether brick blocks now i have nether
 

369
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,110
nether brick blocks now i have nether
brick stairs upside down ones

370
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
brick stairs upside down ones
 

371
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,550
brick stairs upside down ones
to kind of keep the flow going i guess

372
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
to kind of keep the flow going i guess
 

373
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,309
to kind of keep the flow going i guess
you could say

374
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
you could say
 

375
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,350
you could say
and these really aren't uh

376
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
and these really aren't uh
 

377
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,830
and these really aren't uh
for anything like they're not normal in

378
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
for anything like they're not normal in
 

379
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,550
for anything like they're not normal in
housing

380
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
housing
 

381
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,510
housing
in houses or anything uh it's just to

382
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
in houses or anything uh it's just to
 

383
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,070
in houses or anything uh it's just to
give

384
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
give
 

385
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,309
give
the wall a little bit more shape and

386
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
the wall a little bit more shape and
 

387
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,950
the wall a little bit more shape and
texture character whatever

388
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
texture character whatever
 

389
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,950
texture character whatever
compared to having a flat wall all the

390
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
compared to having a flat wall all the
 

391
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,469
compared to having a flat wall all the
way up i think it looks better

392
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
way up i think it looks better
 

393
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,869
way up i think it looks better
to have something at the top like that

394
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
to have something at the top like that
 

395
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,350
to have something at the top like that
over here i kind of beveled the ceiling

396
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
over here i kind of beveled the ceiling
 

397
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,110
over here i kind of beveled the ceiling
up a little bit

398
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
up a little bit
 

399
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,710
up a little bit
for the potion room door because it's a

400
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
for the potion room door because it's a
 

401
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,309
for the potion room door because it's a
really big door

402
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
really big door
 

403
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,670
really big door
and it kind of emphasizes that i would

404
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
and it kind of emphasizes that i would
 

405
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,949
and it kind of emphasizes that i would
say

406
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
say
 

407
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,589
say
some stairs are used upside down stairs

408
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
some stairs are used upside down stairs
 

409
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,790
some stairs are used upside down stairs
to kind of

410
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
to kind of
 

411
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,269
to kind of
smooth out the transition over there

412
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
smooth out the transition over there
 

413
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,550
smooth out the transition over there
i had a lot of trouble with this here

414
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
i had a lot of trouble with this here
 

415
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,949
i had a lot of trouble with this here
there's no way i can cover the sandstone

416
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
there's no way i can cover the sandstone
 

417
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,870
there's no way i can cover the sandstone
because i don't like how it's facing

418
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
because i don't like how it's facing
 

419
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,630
because i don't like how it's facing
there

420
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
there
 

421
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,949
there
because it's not uh it's not too wide

422
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
because it's not uh it's not too wide
 

423
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,790
because it's not uh it's not too wide
the sandstone on this side but it is on

424
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
the sandstone on this side but it is on
 

425
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,070
the sandstone on this side but it is on
this side

426
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
this side
 

427
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,269
this side
so can't really cover that

428
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
so can't really cover that
 

429
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,550
so can't really cover that
up without breaking the flow so i might

430
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
up without breaking the flow so i might
 

431
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,550
up without breaking the flow so i might
have to leave that open

432
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
have to leave that open
 

433
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,870
have to leave that open
and again over here i had trouble

434
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
and again over here i had trouble
 

435
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,710
and again over here i had trouble
shaping it because uh

436
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
shaping it because uh
 

437
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,590
shaping it because uh
this has to come down like this there's

438
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
this has to come down like this there's
 

439
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,110
this has to come down like this there's
water above there

440
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120

 

441
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,430

did i ever see what i didn't like here

442
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
did i ever see what i didn't like here
 

443
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,310
did i ever see what i didn't like here
um

444
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
um
 

445
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,990
um
the glowstone's level with the ground

446
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
the glowstone's level with the ground
 

447
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,470
the glowstone's level with the ground
here but then it goes down and then this

448
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
here but then it goes down and then this
 

449
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,590
here but then it goes down and then this
one's just kind of floating in the air

450
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
one's just kind of floating in the air
 

451
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,750
one's just kind of floating in the air
so not sure what to do about that

452
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
so not sure what to do about that
 

453
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,670
so not sure what to do about that
um

454
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680

 

455
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,269

so it might take a little while to get

456
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
so it might take a little while to get
 

457
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,590
so it might take a little while to get
used to the nether brick

458
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
used to the nether brick
 

459
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,710
used to the nether brick
uh i'm starting to like it already i

460
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
uh i'm starting to like it already i
 

461
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,829
uh i'm starting to like it already i
think it grows on you

462
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
think it grows on you
 

463
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,150
think it grows on you
after a little while it was really

464
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
after a little while it was really
 

465
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,750
after a little while it was really
shocking at first but now i'm

466
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
shocking at first but now i'm
 

467
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,949
shocking at first but now i'm
getting used to it also this brick i

468
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
getting used to it also this brick i
 

469
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,630
getting used to it also this brick i
replaced with upside down stairs

470
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
replaced with upside down stairs
 

471
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,230
replaced with upside down stairs
i might make this door might make it go

472
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
i might make this door might make it go
 

473
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,829
i might make this door might make it go
up a little higher like i have there

474
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
up a little higher like i have there
 

475
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,230
up a little higher like i have there
i may also still raise this door up one

476
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
i may also still raise this door up one
 

477
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,269
i may also still raise this door up one
block i'm not sure yet

478
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
block i'm not sure yet
 

479
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,350
block i'm not sure yet
i we should really start working on that

480
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
i we should really start working on that
 

481
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,230
i we should really start working on that
again

482
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240

 

483
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,550

what else the reason i went with nether

484
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
what else the reason i went with nether
 

485
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,750
what else the reason i went with nether
brick

486
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
brick
 

487
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,310
brick

489
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,310
is i like the dark look to it it kind of
at least for me it makes me not

490
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
at least for me it makes me not
 

491
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,069
at least for me it makes me not
look at the ceiling it makes me look at

492
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
look at the ceiling it makes me look at
 

493
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,150
look at the ceiling it makes me look at
the ground and the walls

494
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
the ground and the walls
 

495
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,190
the ground and the walls
the important stuff so

that's why i kind of went with it
 

499
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,350
that's why i kind of went with it
and

501
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,190

i guess the sandstone just kind of lets

502
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
i guess the sandstone just kind of lets
 

503
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,790
i guess the sandstone just kind of lets

like in the tree farm i think low stone
 

557
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,870
like in the tree farm i think low stone
would look better than the pumpkins

558
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
would look better than the pumpkins
 

559
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,910

565
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,590
that and if you don't know what this
thing is this is just an infinite spring

566
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
thing is this is just an infinite spring
 

567
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,269

573
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,910
put one in as i was building around here
so i just kind of put this here

574
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
so i just kind of put this here
 

575
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,350
so i just kind of put this here
to take care of that need

576
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360

be able to
 

585
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,150
be able to
wreck the infinite spring uh so

586
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
wreck the infinite spring uh so
 

587
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,150
wreck the infinite spring uh so
you can only grab from there the only

588
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
you can only grab from there the only
 

589
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,990
you can only grab from there the only
block that recreates itself so that's

block that recreates itself so that's
 

591
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,150
block that recreates itself so that's
how that works

592
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
how that works
 

593
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,470
how that works
i think that'd be okay um

every day and you might not know the
rules of the cave here

616
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
rules of the cave here
 

617
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,190
rules of the cave here
so basically the ultimate goal i have

618
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
so basically the ultimate goal i have
 

619
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,389
so basically the ultimate goal i have
here is to use no torches for lighting

00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
here is to use no torches for lighting
 

621
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,670
here is to use no torches for lighting
so none of these the ones you see are

so none of these the ones you see are
 

623
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,750
so none of these the ones you see are

other

638
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
other
 

639
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,310
other
goal of this cave thing was to make

640
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
goal of this cave thing was to make
 

641
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,310
goal of this cave thing was to make
everything i built kind of go with the

642
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
everything i built kind of go with the
 

643
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,230
everything i built kind of go with the
natural

644
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
natural
 

645
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,269
natural
shape of the cave so

646
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
shape of the cave so
 

647
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,829
shape of the cave so
if you watch back to about episode 100

648
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
if you watch back to about episode 100
 

649
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,550
if you watch back to about episode 100
and or so basically when we started in

650
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
and or so basically when we started in
 

651
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,990
and or so basically when we started in
this new world

652
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
this new world
 

653
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,310
this new world
uh this cave is really rough looking

654
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
uh this cave is really rough looking
 

655
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,550
uh this cave is really rough looking
but the same shape is basically there a

656
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
but the same shape is basically there a
 

657
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,790
but the same shape is basically there a
few few areas i have

658
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
few few areas i have
 

659
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,110
few few areas i have
cut out like the potion room but

660
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
cut out like the potion room but
 

661
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,670
cut out like the potion room but
this weird cow farm that goes down is

662
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
this weird cow farm that goes down is
 

663
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,150
this weird cow farm that goes down is
there because of

664
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
there because of
 

665
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,069
there because of
there was one of those square rooms that

666
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
there was one of those square rooms that
 

667
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,629
there was one of those square rooms that
you find in abandoned mine shafts there

668
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
you find in abandoned mine shafts there
 

669
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,750
you find in abandoned mine shafts there
so i tried to keep that shape

670
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
so i tried to keep that shape
 

671
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,670
so i tried to keep that shape
built that lower

672
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680

 

673
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,269

and that was just the basic goal behind

674
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
and that was just the basic goal behind
 

675
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,629
and that was just the basic goal behind
this and so far i think we've done

676
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
this and so far i think we've done
 

677
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,670
this and so far i think we've done
pretty good with that

678
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
pretty good with that
 

679
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,750
pretty good with that
i think we've um went with our

680
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
i think we've um went with our
 

681
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,509
i think we've um went with our
main objective we do have to hear these

682
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
main objective we do have to hear these
 

683
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,150
main objective we do have to hear these
torches yet

684
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
torches yet
 

685
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,150
torches yet
i don't know how to do that

686
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160

 

687
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,910

because it'll be too dark here mobs will

688
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
because it'll be too dark here mobs will
 

689
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,189
because it'll be too dark here mobs will
be able to spawn if these aren't here

690
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
be able to spawn if these aren't here
 

691
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,470
be able to spawn if these aren't here
um could put them

692
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
um could put them
 

693
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,430
um could put them
on top maybe

694
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440

 

695
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,430

we would need another one here probably

696
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
we would need another one here probably
 

697
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,670
we would need another one here probably
uh it's one possibility the other is to

698
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
uh it's one possibility the other is to
 

699
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,470
uh it's one possibility the other is to
maybe put in the ground

700
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
maybe put in the ground
 

701
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,269
maybe put in the ground
instead

702
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279

 

703
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,150

let's see

704
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160

 

705
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,829

do something like that and maybe

706
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839

 

707
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,509

it's tricky to sneak lighting in here

708
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
it's tricky to sneak lighting in here
 

709
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,870
it's tricky to sneak lighting in here
because it's pretty there's not really a

710
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
because it's pretty there's not really a
 

711
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,470
because it's pretty there's not really a
anything built here this is a straight

712
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
anything built here this is a straight
 

713
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,269
anything built here this is a straight
line of fence

714
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279

 

715
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,710

i'll probably have to put it on top if

716
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
i'll probably have to put it on top if
 

717
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,629
i'll probably have to put it on top if
you got ideas let me know

718
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
you got ideas let me know
 

719
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,230
you got ideas let me know
maybe we'll just leave it plain for

720
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
maybe we'll just leave it plain for
 

721
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,749
maybe we'll just leave it plain for
today

722
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
today
 

723
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,350
today
get the torches back here

724
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360

 

725
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,990

but once that's done i think uh we got a

726
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
but once that's done i think uh we got a
 

727
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,710
but once that's done i think uh we got a
lot of this area pretty much finished

728
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720

 

729
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,310

like we got the walls done we got the

730
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
like we got the walls done we got the
 

731
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,389
like we got the walls done we got the
ceiling done um

732
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
ceiling done um
 

733
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,949
ceiling done um
rooms are built that's a big portion of

734
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
rooms are built that's a big portion of
 

735
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,509
rooms are built that's a big portion of
the cave that i can

736
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
the cave that i can
 

737
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,189
the cave that i can
fairly comfortably say is complete

738
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
fairly comfortably say is complete
 

739
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,189
fairly comfortably say is complete
but then obviously once you get to about

740
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
but then obviously once you get to about
 

741
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,310
but then obviously once you get to about
over here

742
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
over here
 

743
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,189
over here
it's a mess again and we'll have to work

744
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
it's a mess again and we'll have to work
 

745
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,990
it's a mess again and we'll have to work
on that

746
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000

 

747
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,310

all right so now i think we're going to

748
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
all right so now i think we're going to
 

749
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,829
all right so now i think we're going to
take a few minutes to play around with

750
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
take a few minutes to play around with
 

751
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,629
take a few minutes to play around with
the

752
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
the
 

753
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,749
the
idea i had um for kind of like an

754
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
idea i had um for kind of like an
 

755
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,189
idea i had um for kind of like an
elevator

756
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
elevator
 

757
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,550
elevator
um it's not an elevator though just a

758
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
um it's not an elevator though just a
 

759
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,470
um it's not an elevator though just a
way of using ender pearls quickly

760
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
way of using ender pearls quickly
 

761
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,110
way of using ender pearls quickly
easily because i've i've mentioned this

762
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
easily because i've i've mentioned this
 

763
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,470
easily because i've i've mentioned this
before but i'm probably going to build

764
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
before but i'm probably going to build
 

765
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,629
before but i'm probably going to build
like a mine shaft somewhere

766
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
like a mine shaft somewhere
 

767
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,990
like a mine shaft somewhere
maybe a ways away from here that i can

768
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
maybe a ways away from here that i can
 

769
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,430
maybe a ways away from here that i can
freely dig for redstone and diamonds and

770
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
freely dig for redstone and diamonds and
 

771
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,230
freely dig for redstone and diamonds and
everything

772
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
everything
 

773
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,749
everything
without having to worry about lighting

774
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
without having to worry about lighting
 

775
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,990
without having to worry about lighting
up the tunnels afterward

776
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
up the tunnels afterward
 

777
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,110
up the tunnels afterward
and obviously i'm going to need a way of

778
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
and obviously i'm going to need a way of
 

779
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,710
and obviously i'm going to need a way of
going down to bedrock

780
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
going down to bedrock
 

781
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,790
going down to bedrock
level or close to bedrock level and then

782
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
level or close to bedrock level and then
 

783
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,549
level or close to bedrock level and then
back up quickly because i'll probably

784
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
back up quickly because i'll probably
 

785
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,789
back up quickly because i'll probably
be going up and down quite often

786
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799

 

787
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,549

and i i do have an infinite supply of

788
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
and i i do have an infinite supply of
 

789
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,949
and i i do have an infinite supply of
ender pearls basically so i think the

790
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
ender pearls basically so i think the
 

791
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,870
ender pearls basically so i think the
easiest way or the quickest way of

792
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
easiest way or the quickest way of
 

793
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,990
easiest way or the quickest way of
making

794
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
making
 

795
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,069
making
a way to get back up is with ender

796
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
a way to get back up is with ender
 

797
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,189
a way to get back up is with ender
pearls

798
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
pearls
 

799
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,630
pearls
and we've played around with this before

800
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
and we've played around with this before
 

801
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,949
and we've played around with this before
i think they went up 33 blocks or

802
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
i think they went up 33 blocks or
 

803
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,990
i think they went up 33 blocks or
something

804
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
something
 

805
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,110
something
when we tested

806
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120

 

807
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,110

so yeah the idea i have is to use uh

808
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
so yeah the idea i have is to use uh
 

809
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,310
so yeah the idea i have is to use uh
or try to use fences um

810
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
or try to use fences um
 

811
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,430
or try to use fences um
let's see we'll go up a little bit here

812
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
let's see we'll go up a little bit here
 

813
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,789
let's see we'll go up a little bit here
now we can probably just jump and do it

814
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
now we can probably just jump and do it
 

815
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,430
now we can probably just jump and do it
i think if we have two by two thing of

816
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
i think if we have two by two thing of
 

817
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,630
i think if we have two by two thing of
fences

818
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
fences
 

819
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,029
fences
there'll be a gap in between that we

820
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
there'll be a gap in between that we
 

821
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,549
there'll be a gap in between that we
might be able to throw an ender pearl

822
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
might be able to throw an ender pearl
 

823
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,430
might be able to throw an ender pearl
through

824
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440

 

825
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,310

that we won't fall through ourselves oh

826
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
that we won't fall through ourselves oh
 

827
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,190
that we won't fall through ourselves oh
maybe not

828
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200

 

829
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,909

okay that idea doesn't work

830
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919

 

831
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,070

okay let me think here

832
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
okay let me think here
 

833
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,669
okay let me think here
i kind of want to do something where

834
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
i kind of want to do something where
 

835
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,669
i kind of want to do something where
we'll have a pressure plate

836
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
we'll have a pressure plate
 

837
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,230
we'll have a pressure plate
on a fence

838
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240

 

839
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,310

and the ender pearl activates the

840
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
and the ender pearl activates the
 

841
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,350
and the ender pearl activates the
pressure plates

842
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
pressure plates
 

843
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,470
pressure plates
you think that would be possible

844
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
you think that would be possible
 

845
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,070
you think that would be possible
the idea i had there isn't going to work

846
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
the idea i had there isn't going to work
 

847
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,029
the idea i had there isn't going to work
after all so

848
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
after all so
 

849
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,310
after all so
too bad um

850
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320

 

851
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,830

i'm going to put some pressure plates on

852
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
i'm going to put some pressure plates on
 

853
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,310
i'm going to put some pressure plates on
here and we'll just see if we can

854
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
here and we'll just see if we can
 

855
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,830
here and we'll just see if we can
activate them with an ender pearl from

856
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
activate them with an ender pearl from
 

857
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,270
activate them with an ender pearl from
below

858
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
below
 

859
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,430
below
or if it's going to hit the fence

860
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440

 

861
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,830

i think it went through it without

862
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840

 

863
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,390

um

864
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400

 

865
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,750

hmm it's hard to tell

866
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760

 

867
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,590

every time it clicks down is the time

868
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
every time it clicks down is the time
 

869
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,470
every time it clicks down is the time
when i

870
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
when i
 

871
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,150
when i
get in the fence um

872
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
get in the fence um
 

873
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,510
get in the fence um
don't think we can actually hit it

874
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
don't think we can actually hit it
 

875
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,710
don't think we can actually hit it
without yeah

876
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720

 

877
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,789

hmm that's too bad

878
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
hmm that's too bad
 

879
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,070
hmm that's too bad
i was thinking like you could just put

880
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
i was thinking like you could just put
 

881
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,909
i was thinking like you could just put
some blocks over top

882
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
some blocks over top
 

883
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,270
some blocks over top
the gap there and just throw

884
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
the gap there and just throw
 

885
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,909
the gap there and just throw
ender pearl up and you would fall down

886
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
ender pearl up and you would fall down
 

887
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,310
ender pearl up and you would fall down
a block or so onto the fence again

888
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
a block or so onto the fence again
 

889
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,510
a block or so onto the fence again
um

890
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520

 

891
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,190

okay maybe i'll rethink this a little

892
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
okay maybe i'll rethink this a little
 

893
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,029
okay maybe i'll rethink this a little
bit just give me a minute

894
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039

 

895
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,190

so i'm thinking uh we might be able to

896
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
so i'm thinking uh we might be able to
 

897
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,150
so i'm thinking uh we might be able to
do something with a

898
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
do something with a
 

899
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,590
do something with a
boat possibly oh

900
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
boat possibly oh
 

901
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,350
boat possibly oh
if we have a boat over here not sure if

902
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
if we have a boat over here not sure if
 

903
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,070
if we have a boat over here not sure if
uh i'm pretty sure like the ender pearl

904
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
uh i'm pretty sure like the ender pearl
 

905
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,590
uh i'm pretty sure like the ender pearl
will hit the boat

906
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
will hit the boat
 

907
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,110
will hit the boat
and teleport us i'm not sure if we'll

908
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
and teleport us i'm not sure if we'll
 

909
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,110
and teleport us i'm not sure if we'll
get teleported above or below the boat

910
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
get teleported above or below the boat
 

911
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,950
get teleported above or below the boat
though

912
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
though
 

913
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,350
though
ideally i want to get above the boat

914
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360

 

915
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,270

you know kind of uh

916
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280

 

917
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,789

it's hard to see how high i'm actually

918
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
it's hard to see how high i'm actually
 

919
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,740
it's hard to see how high i'm actually
getting teleported

920
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:25,750

 

921
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,310

[Music]

922
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
[Music]
 

923
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,950
[Music]
oh that's where it changes your view

924
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
oh that's where it changes your view
 

925
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,390
oh that's where it changes your view
on its own

926
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400

 

927
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,750

okay uh that's not gonna work i will

928
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
okay uh that's not gonna work i will
 

929
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,950
okay uh that's not gonna work i will
think of something else

930
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
think of something else
 

931
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,430
think of something else
what i'm trying to do here is uh have a

932
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
what i'm trying to do here is uh have a
 

933
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,190
what i'm trying to do here is uh have a
certain block you walk up to on the

934
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
certain block you walk up to on the
 

935
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,149
certain block you walk up to on the
ground

936
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
ground
 

937
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,830
ground
that's marked or something and then it's

938
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
that's marked or something and then it's
 

939
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,669
that's marked or something and then it's
you wouldn't have to aim you just move

940
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
you wouldn't have to aim you just move
 

941
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,110
you wouldn't have to aim you just move
your mouse up and throw the pearl

942
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
your mouse up and throw the pearl
 

943
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,270
your mouse up and throw the pearl
so i'm going to try water and a lily pad

944
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
so i'm going to try water and a lily pad
 

945
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,270
so i'm going to try water and a lily pad
now i don't know if you would make it

946
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
now i don't know if you would make it
 

947
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,710
now i don't know if you would make it
through the lily pad i kind of don't

948
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
through the lily pad i kind of don't
 

949
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,029
through the lily pad i kind of don't
think you can swim up through them

950
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039

 

951
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,510

oh it does work awesome that's one idea

952
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
oh it does work awesome that's one idea
 

953
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,789
oh it does work awesome that's one idea
um you can get out yeah you can

954
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
um you can get out yeah you can
 

955
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,350
um you can get out yeah you can
okay that might work that's pretty easy

956
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
okay that might work that's pretty easy
 

957
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,110
okay that might work that's pretty easy
to build too

958
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120

 

959
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,549

beautiful so you'd probably only need

960
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
beautiful so you'd probably only need
 

961
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,230
beautiful so you'd probably only need
two of those to make it all the way up

962
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
two of those to make it all the way up
 

963
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,870
two of those to make it all the way up
from

964
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
from
 

965
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,350
from
bedrock to the surface i would think

966
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360

 

967
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,029

let's see i was going to try something

968
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
let's see i was going to try something
 

969
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,350
let's see i was going to try something
else too oh yeah trapdoors

970
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
else too oh yeah trapdoors
 

971
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,230
else too oh yeah trapdoors
might be worth trying that yet

972
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240

 

973
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,669

awesome

974
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679

 

975
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,950

okay i'm gonna do a trapdoor now

976
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
okay i'm gonna do a trapdoor now
 

977
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,230
okay i'm gonna do a trapdoor now
one minute now we're gonna try it first

978
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
one minute now we're gonna try it first
 

979
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,990
one minute now we're gonna try it first
with water below the trapdoor and see

980
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
with water below the trapdoor and see
 

981
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,070
with water below the trapdoor and see
how that goes

982
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080

 

983
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,110

okay and yeah the idea is

984
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
okay and yeah the idea is
 

985
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,789
okay and yeah the idea is
you have a spot marked then you could

986
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
you have a spot marked then you could
 

987
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,909
you have a spot marked then you could
easily walk up to it and quickly

988
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
easily walk up to it and quickly
 

989
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,590
easily walk up to it and quickly
throw the pearl without having to aim

990
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
throw the pearl without having to aim
 

991
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,190
throw the pearl without having to aim
like sort of at an angle

992
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
like sort of at an angle
 

993
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,789
like sort of at an angle
or a specific spot

994
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799

 

995
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,630

okay i didn't i wasn't swimming there i

996
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
okay i didn't i wasn't swimming there i
 

997
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,430
okay i didn't i wasn't swimming there i
just wanted to see if i would stay up

998
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440

 

999
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,669

that time i'm swimming and i can get out

1000
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:37,679
that time i'm swimming and i can get out
 

1001
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,510
that time i'm swimming and i can get out
so it's much like the lily pad we're

1002
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
so it's much like the lily pad we're
 

1003
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,270
so it's much like the lily pad we're
going to try it one more

1004
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
going to try it one more
 

1005
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,190
going to try it one more
or one different way here too

1006
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200

 

1007
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,510

which probably won't work just have the

1008
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
which probably won't work just have the
 

1009
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,350
which probably won't work just have the
trapdoor alone

1010
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360

 

1011
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,549

get rid of that maybe put it over there

1012
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559

 

1013
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,149

oh not too late i love feather falling

1014
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
oh not too late i love feather falling
 

1015
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,070
oh not too late i love feather falling
it's awesome

1016
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080

 

1017
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,750

okay just fall through

1018
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
okay just fall through
 

1019
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,510
okay just fall through
oh how did i do that i was holding jump

1020
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
oh how did i do that i was holding jump
 

1021
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,909
oh how did i do that i was holding jump
that time

1022
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919

 

1023
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,350

hmm let's try that again

1024
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
hmm let's try that again
 

1025
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,789
hmm let's try that again
maybe we'll be a little bit more

1026
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
maybe we'll be a little bit more
 

1027
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,710
maybe we'll be a little bit more
accurate on our aiming go first

1028
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
accurate on our aiming go first
 

1029
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,950
accurate on our aiming go first
the very center this time

1030
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960

 

1031
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,310

um yeah that would be

1032
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
um yeah that would be
 

1033
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,470
um yeah that would be
that'd probably be inconsistent i'm

1034
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
that'd probably be inconsistent i'm
 

1035
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,750
that'd probably be inconsistent i'm
gonna play around with it a bit and see

1036
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
gonna play around with it a bit and see
 

1037
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,990
gonna play around with it a bit and see
if i can figure out how i uh

1038
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
if i can figure out how i uh
 

1039
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,710
if i can figure out how i uh
jumped again that one time

1040
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720

 

1041
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,950

yeah it seems to be a timing thing you

1042
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
yeah it seems to be a timing thing you
 

1043
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,029
yeah it seems to be a timing thing you
gotta jump right when the ender pearl

1044
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
gotta jump right when the ender pearl
 

1045
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,230
gotta jump right when the ender pearl
hits the

1046
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
hits the
 

1047
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,269
hits the
the door or close to that time anyway

1048
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
the door or close to that time anyway
 

1049
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,070
the door or close to that time anyway
there we go it's hard to do every time i

1050
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
there we go it's hard to do every time i
 

1051
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,750
there we go it's hard to do every time i
can only do it maybe half the time at

1052
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
can only do it maybe half the time at
 

1053
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,470
can only do it maybe half the time at
best

1054
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
best
 

1055
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,510
best
so i don't think i'll be doing

1056
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
so i don't think i'll be doing
 

1057
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,430
so i don't think i'll be doing
this method probably do the lillypad one

1058
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
this method probably do the lillypad one
 

1059
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,789
this method probably do the lillypad one
seems to work the best

1060
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
seems to work the best
 

1061
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,149
seems to work the best
actually i'm getting really good at this

1062
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
actually i'm getting really good at this
 

1063
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,950
actually i'm getting really good at this
now

1064
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960

 

1065
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,990

uh yeah but yeah lilypad is

1066
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
uh yeah but yeah lilypad is
 

1067
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,830
uh yeah but yeah lilypad is
there we go the safest way of doing it

1068
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
there we go the safest way of doing it
 

1069
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,430
there we go the safest way of doing it
because that's like a

1070
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
because that's like a
 

1071
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,669
because that's like a
i'll probably have it them 30 blocks

1072
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
i'll probably have it them 30 blocks
 

1073
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,190
i'll probably have it them 30 blocks
apart or so

1074
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
apart or so
 

1075
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,269
apart or so
uh that's a drop that would kill you for

1076
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
uh that's a drop that would kill you for
 

1077
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,789
uh that's a drop that would kill you for
sure if you didn't have feather falling

1078
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
sure if you didn't have feather falling
 

1079
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,070
sure if you didn't have feather falling
so definitely

1080
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
so definitely
 

1081
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,269
so definitely
got to do something safer than this uh

1082
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
got to do something safer than this uh
 

1083
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,950
got to do something safer than this uh

apples
 

1127
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,870
apples
or by making instant health potions

where
 

1133
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,669
where
the golden apples require eight gold to

1134
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
the golden apples require eight gold to
 

1135
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,310
the golden apples require eight gold to
create

1136
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320

 

1137
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,350

uh like eight to eight ingots not

1138
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
uh like eight to eight ingots not
 

1139
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,590
uh like eight to eight ingots not
eight nuggets so it takes a lot of gold

1140
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
eight nuggets so it takes a lot of gold
 

1141
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,510
eight nuggets so it takes a lot of gold
to make a single apple

1142
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
to make a single apple
 

1143
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,029
to make a single apple
and the instant health potions take

1144
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
and the instant health potions take
 

1145
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,190
and the instant health potions take
a full gold block so nine ingots to make

1146
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
a full gold block so nine ingots to make
 

1147
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,990
a full gold block so nine ingots to make
so it's a real challenge to get uh

1148
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
so it's a real challenge to get uh
 

1149
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,950
so it's a real challenge to get uh
health in that

1150
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
health in that
 

1151
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,909
health in that
