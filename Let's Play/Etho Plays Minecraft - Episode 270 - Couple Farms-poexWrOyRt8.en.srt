00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
build if possible one of them is that
 

325
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,110
build if possible one of them is that
mini farm which I made a tutorial for I

326
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
mini farm which I made a tutorial for I
 

327
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,330
mini farm which I made a tutorial for I
think about a month ago which I'll

328
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:19,340
think about a month ago which I'll
 

329
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,760
think about a month ago which I'll
probably just put that in on my own and

330
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:21,770
probably just put that in on my own and
 

331
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,410
probably just put that in on my own and
show you after it because I've shown how

332
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,420
show you after it because I've shown how
 

333
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,350
show you after it because I've shown how
to build it's question is where we gonna

334
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,360
to build it's question is where we gonna
 

335
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,820
to build it's question is where we gonna
put this stuff actually maybe over in

336
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:30,830
put this stuff actually maybe over in
 

337
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,100
put this stuff actually maybe over in
this area because this is new new area

338
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,110
this area because this is new new area
 

339
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,920
this area because this is new new area
and it's all barren like there's no

340
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:34,930
and it's all barren like there's no
 

341
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,420
and it's all barren like there's no
nothing on these walls or anything so we

342
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,430
nothing on these walls or anything so we
 

343
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,420
nothing on these walls or anything so we
could put some machines here I think

344
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,430
could put some machines here I think
 

345
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,450
could put some machines here I think
let's just test this out make sure we

346
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:43,460
let's just test this out make sure we
 

347
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,870
let's just test this out make sure we
have space to put stuff both the things

348
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
have space to put stuff both the things
 

349
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
have space to put stuff both the things
I want to build are pretty small so I'm

350
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:48,890
I want to build are pretty small so I'm
 

351
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,370
I want to build are pretty small so I'm
not too worried about space yeah we

352
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:54,380
not too worried about space yeah we
 

353
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,170
not too worried about space yeah we
could put stuff here let's looks like a

354
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,180
could put stuff here let's looks like a
 

355
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,690
could put stuff here let's looks like a
solid wall with nothing behind I'll

356
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:01,700
solid wall with nothing behind I'll
 

357
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,870
solid wall with nothing behind I'll
check up a little bit yeah that's good

358
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
check up a little bit yeah that's good
 

359
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
check up a little bit yeah that's good
oh got some cobble there I know the

360
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:08,570
oh got some cobble there I know the
 

361
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,750
oh got some cobble there I know the
spider farm is very close to this it's

362
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:10,760
spider farm is very close to this it's
 

363
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,890
spider farm is very close to this it's
just over I see this quite a ways away

364
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:14,900
just over I see this quite a ways away
 

365
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,880
just over I see this quite a ways away
one of them is over here so I'll go

366
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:18,890
one of them is over here so I'll go
 

367
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,860
one of them is over here so I'll go
ahead and start setting that up probably

368
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:20,870
ahead and start setting that up probably
 

369
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,880
ahead and start setting that up probably
put it's right here and then the other

370
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:24,890
put it's right here and then the other
 

371
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,200
put it's right here and then the other
thing we'll put beside it or something

372
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,210
thing we'll put beside it or something
 

373
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,480
thing we'll put beside it or something
awesome so we got our mini farm built

374
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,490
awesome so we got our mini farm built
 

375
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,230
awesome so we got our mini farm built
here this

376
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
here this
 

377
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,900
here this
is very very handy to have I've wanted

378
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:34,910
is very very handy to have I've wanted
 

379
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,850
is very very handy to have I've wanted
to make one in my world here for a while

380
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:36,860
to make one in my world here for a while
 

381
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,040
to make one in my world here for a while
I made it tutorial on this about a month

382
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,050
I made it tutorial on this about a month
 

383
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,690
I made it tutorial on this about a month
ago so I'm not going to go into super

384
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:40,700
ago so I'm not going to go into super
 

385
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,329
ago so I'm not going to go into super
detail on how it works both I let the

386
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:43,339
detail on how it works both I let the
 

387
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:45,670
detail on how it works both I let the
kind of open just so we could get an

388
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
kind of open just so we could get an
 

389
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,610
kind of open just so we could get an
overview basically this is for growing

390
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:50,620
overview basically this is for growing
 

391
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,160

carrots cocoa beans wheat and potatoes I

392
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,170
carrots cocoa beans wheat and potatoes I
 

393
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,720
carrots cocoa beans wheat and potatoes I
don't have any potato seeds though but

394
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:58,730
don't have any potato seeds though but
 

395
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,250
don't have any potato seeds though but
yeah these dispensers they have bone

396
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,260
yeah these dispensers they have bone
 

397
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,769
yeah these dispensers they have bone
meal in all three of them and when we

398
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:02,779
meal in all three of them and when we
 

399
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,570
meal in all three of them and when we
step on this pressure plate just runs a

400
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:04,580
step on this pressure plate just runs a
 

401
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,840
step on this pressure plate just runs a
clock that makes this go up and down

402
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:06,850
clock that makes this go up and down
 

403
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,280
clock that makes this go up and down
chests are just for extra bone meal

404
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,290
chests are just for extra bone meal
 

405
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,199
chests are just for extra bone meal
storage hold right click and should work

406
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:14,209
storage hold right click and should work
 

407
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,970
storage hold right click and should work
yet we're getting more carrots than you

408
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:15,980
yet we're getting more carrots than you
 

409
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,120
yet we're getting more carrots than you
start with really simple if we take a

410
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,130
start with really simple if we take a
 

411
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,360
start with really simple if we take a
look down here this is the clock which

412
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,370
look down here this is the clock which
 

413
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,540
look down here this is the clock which
only gets activated when that goes off

414
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:27,550
only gets activated when that goes off
 

415
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,769
only gets activated when that goes off
further down we have some wiring it's a

416
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:32,779
further down we have some wiring it's a
 

417
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,740
further down we have some wiring it's a
little blocked up but yeah like I said

418
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:34,750
little blocked up but yeah like I said
 

419
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,329
little blocked up but yeah like I said
there is a tutorial on this if you want

420
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:37,339
there is a tutorial on this if you want
 

421
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,230
there is a tutorial on this if you want
to know let's finish closing this off

422
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,240
to know let's finish closing this off
 

423
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,740
to know let's finish closing this off
and we'll move on to our next project

424
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,750
and we'll move on to our next project
 

425
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,750
and we'll move on to our next project
next thing I want to build is a snow

426
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,760
next thing I want to build is a snow
 

427
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,590
next thing I want to build is a snow
golem farm for getting snow this is

428
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,600
golem farm for getting snow this is
 

429
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,470
golem farm for getting snow this is
about done right I did bring some chests

430
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,480
about done right I did bring some chests
 

431
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,269
about done right I did bring some chests
we could either put two chests inside

432
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
we could either put two chests inside
 

433
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,480
we could either put two chests inside
here for storing stuff or maybe we want

434
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,490
here for storing stuff or maybe we want
 

435
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,480
here for storing stuff or maybe we want
to put them over here even see I'll

436
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,490
to put them over here even see I'll
 

437
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,220
to put them over here even see I'll
probably put lamps and then the chests

438
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,230
probably put lamps and then the chests
 

439
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,990
probably put lamps and then the chests
on top so we can hide some lighting that

440
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
on top so we can hide some lighting that
 

441
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,510
on top so we can hide some lighting that
way on the outside here but yeah we're

442
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:10,520
way on the outside here but yeah we're
 

443
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,510
way on the outside here but yeah we're
gonna start the snow snow farm here and

444
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:13,520
gonna start the snow snow farm here and
 

445
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,100
gonna start the snow snow farm here and
I'm gonna get my stuff together for that

446
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,110
I'm gonna get my stuff together for that
 

447
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,889
I'm gonna get my stuff together for that
and we will begin so I don't know

448
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:20,899
and we will begin so I don't know
 

449
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,180
and we will begin so I don't know
exactly how I want to build this thing

450
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,190
exactly how I want to build this thing
 

451
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,769
exactly how I want to build this thing
the thing about snow golems they can

452
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:26,779
the thing about snow golems they can
 

453
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,360
the thing about snow golems they can
only leave a snow trail in certain

454
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,370
only leave a snow trail in certain
 

455
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,240
only leave a snow trail in certain
biomes and in some biomes they actually

456
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,250
biomes and in some biomes they actually
 

457
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,970
biomes and in some biomes they actually
die like desert and in the nether

458
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:33,980
die like desert and in the nether
 

459
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,190
die like desert and in the nether
they'll just die in there we're not

460
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,200
they'll just die in there we're not
 

461
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,900
they'll just die in there we're not
gonna stuff there it is

462
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:37,910
gonna stuff there it is
 

463
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,769
gonna stuff there it is
this is forest biome though we're gonna

464
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:41,779
this is forest biome though we're gonna
 

465
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,980
this is forest biome though we're gonna
put it over here pretty sure they'll

466
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:44,990
put it over here pretty sure they'll
 

467
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,079
put it over here pretty sure they'll
leave us no trail

468
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:46,089
leave us no trail
 

469
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,230
leave us no trail
a forest biome and I think a mountain

470
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,240
a forest biome and I think a mountain
 

471
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,220
a forest biome and I think a mountain
one I know they don't in a plane so yeah

472
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,230
one I know they don't in a plane so yeah
 

473
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,360
one I know they don't in a plane so yeah
look at that that's good

474
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,370
look at that that's good
 

475
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,829
look at that that's good
sorry you did not live long poor guy

476
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:58,839
sorry you did not live long poor guy
 

477
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,249
sorry you did not live long poor guy
but it's for science yes we'll mind this

478
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:02,259
but it's for science yes we'll mind this
 

479
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,799
but it's for science yes we'll mind this
out actually let's mark that spot so I

480
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:04,809
out actually let's mark that spot so I
 

481
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,710
out actually let's mark that spot so I
don't forget it I try to make stuff

482
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:07,720
don't forget it I try to make stuff
 

483
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,100
don't forget it I try to make stuff
symmetrical when I can and not that it's

484
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,110
symmetrical when I can and not that it's
 

485
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,769
symmetrical when I can and not that it's
super important but it does help to make

486
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:16,779
super important but it does help to make
 

487
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,869
super important but it does help to make
things look better in the end of the in

488
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:18,879
things look better in the end of the in
 

489
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,749
things look better in the end of the in
the end of everything so when I made the

490
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:21,759
the end of everything so when I made the
 

491
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,309
the end of everything so when I made the
snow my giant snow mob firm at the other

492
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:26,319
snow my giant snow mob firm at the other
 

493
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,840
snow my giant snow mob firm at the other
base I I have to get a lot of snow

494
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,850
base I I have to get a lot of snow
 

495
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,689
base I I have to get a lot of snow
harvested from these guys and I learnt

496
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:33,699
harvested from these guys and I learnt
 

497
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:37,369
harvested from these guys and I learnt
the two most painful parts of that is

498
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:37,379
the two most painful parts of that is
 

499
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,259
the two most painful parts of that is
picking up the snow after you you

500
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:40,269
picking up the snow after you you
 

501
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,840
picking up the snow after you you
collect it and then crafting it into

502
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:42,850
collect it and then crafting it into
 

503
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,759
collect it and then crafting it into
snow blocks it's probably the worst part

504
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:44,769
snow blocks it's probably the worst part
 

505
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,350
snow blocks it's probably the worst part
of it there's no real way to get around

506
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,360
of it there's no real way to get around
 

507
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,079
of it there's no real way to get around
that but we can Otto collects know with

508
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,089
that but we can Otto collects know with
 

509
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:53,879
that but we can Otto collects know with
hoppers and stuff so what we're trying

510
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:53,889
hoppers and stuff so what we're trying
 

511
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,169
hoppers and stuff so what we're trying
to do here and regardless I need the

512
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:58,179
to do here and regardless I need the
 

513
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,079
to do here and regardless I need the
snow farm for whenever I do a snow

514
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:01,089
snow farm for whenever I do a snow
 

515
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:10,410
snow farm for whenever I do a snow
project so if we do this all right it'll

516
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:10,420
project so if we do this all right it'll
 

517
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,470
project so if we do this all right it'll
leave us no trail he won't make it

518
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,480
leave us no trail he won't make it
 

519
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,239
leave us no trail he won't make it
outside of the glass area though until

520
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:15,249
outside of the glass area though until
 

521
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,749
outside of the glass area though until
we power these let's go ahead and try

522
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:18,759
we power these let's go ahead and try
 

523
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,730
we power these let's go ahead and try
that there we go I pushes them to the

524
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:23,740
that there we go I pushes them to the
 

525
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,280
that there we go I pushes them to the
corner and then he does this and we can

526
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,290
corner and then he does this and we can
 

527
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,900
corner and then he does this and we can
harvest that get snowballs the question

528
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:29,910
harvest that get snowballs the question
 

529
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,530
harvest that get snowballs the question
can we make that snow trail on top of a

530
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:34,540
can we make that snow trail on top of a
 

531
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,139
can we make that snow trail on top of a
hopper because if we can that simplifies

532
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:37,149
hopper because if we can that simplifies
 

533
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,600
hopper because if we can that simplifies
things greatly and it doesn't look like

534
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:42,610
things greatly and it doesn't look like
 

535
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,650
things greatly and it doesn't look like
it

536
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:44,660
it
 

537
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,790
it
No okay so that's it that makes it a

538
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
No okay so that's it that makes it a
 

539
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,500
No okay so that's it that makes it a
little more complicated I've thought of

540
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,510
little more complicated I've thought of
 

541
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,750
little more complicated I've thought of
this so I think the what the way we're

542
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:56,760
this so I think the what the way we're
 

543
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,570
this so I think the what the way we're
gonna deal with that is we're going to

544
00:14:59,570 --> 00:14:59,580
gonna deal with that is we're going to
 

545
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,010
gonna deal with that is we're going to
use a hopper minecart instead like so

546
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,020
use a hopper minecart instead like so
 

547
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,870
use a hopper minecart instead like so
then I would like get on a track - we

548
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:11,880
then I would like get on a track - we
 

549
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,460
then I would like get on a track - we
can't really put it on a track like if

550
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:16,470
can't really put it on a track like if
 

551
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,870
can't really put it on a track like if
we put the track there we won't get the

552
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
we put the track there we won't get the
 

553
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,800
we put the track there we won't get the
snow if we do it this way push it

554
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:24,810
snow if we do it this way push it
 

555
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,019
snow if we do it this way push it
towards them

556
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:26,029
towards them
 

557
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,540
towards them
why did that go up does this does it

558
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:29,550
why did that go up does this does it
 

559
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,030
why did that go up does this does it
have a collision box to it now yeah we

560
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
have a collision box to it now yeah we
 

561
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,260
have a collision box to it now yeah we
could do something like that and that

562
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,270
could do something like that and that
 

563
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:48,370
could do something like that and that
collects it then the only question is

564
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:48,380

 

565
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,120

what do we do with the snow I guess yeah

566
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,130
what do we do with the snow I guess yeah
 

567
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,019
what do we do with the snow I guess yeah
let's put a hopper here since we can and

568
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:57,029
let's put a hopper here since we can and
 

569
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,710
let's put a hopper here since we can and
we can put a track on that that'll drain

570
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
we can put a track on that that'll drain
 

571
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,269
we can put a track on that that'll drain
the snowballs out of there that actually

572
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:02,279
the snowballs out of there that actually
 

573
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,890
the snowballs out of there that actually
is pretty slow though isn't it so

574
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:06,900
is pretty slow though isn't it so
 

575
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
is pretty slow though isn't it so
another idea is we could have another

576
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:08,910
another idea is we could have another
 

577
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,360
another idea is we could have another
hopper minecart underneath that block -

578
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,370
hopper minecart underneath that block -
 

579
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,620
hopper minecart underneath that block -
and then we'll have its exporting in two

580
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:15,630
and then we'll have its exporting in two
 

581
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,350
and then we'll have its exporting in two
places

582
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
places
 

583
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,310
places
fireeyes yeah I like that idea all right

584
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,320
fireeyes yeah I like that idea all right
 

585
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,900
fireeyes yeah I like that idea all right
well I'll work on that a little bit here

586
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:26,910
well I'll work on that a little bit here
 

587
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:35,940
well I'll work on that a little bit here
and see how it goes

588
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:35,950

 

589
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,310

I'm just wondering now if we were to get

590
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,320
I'm just wondering now if we were to get
 

591
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,990
I'm just wondering now if we were to get
rid of this hopper and just have a chest

592
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,000
rid of this hopper and just have a chest
 

593
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,200
rid of this hopper and just have a chest
there would it be able to put stuff in a

594
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,210
there would it be able to put stuff in a
 

595
00:16:44,210 --> 00:17:03,310
there would it be able to put stuff in a
chest like it filled up huh should we

596
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:03,320
chest like it filled up huh should we
 

597
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,980
chest like it filled up huh should we
try to do this look for it as well or

598
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:05,990
try to do this look for it as well or
 

599
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,180
try to do this look for it as well or
should we try to do a snow look I wonder

600
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,190
should we try to do a snow look I wonder
 

601
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,230
should we try to do a snow look I wonder
maybe we'll just give this one a shot

602
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,240
maybe we'll just give this one a shot
 

603
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,650
maybe we'll just give this one a shot
and see what it looks like let's just

604
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:17,660
and see what it looks like let's just
 

605
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,840
and see what it looks like let's just
test this hopper minecart underneath -

606
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:19,850
test this hopper minecart underneath -
 

607
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:29,050
test this hopper minecart underneath -
and make sure that works picking it up

608
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,060
and make sure that works picking it up
 

609
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,420
and make sure that works picking it up
doesn't look like it did get any is

610
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,430
doesn't look like it did get any is
 

611
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,310
doesn't look like it did get any is
there any in the hopper oh there is some

612
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
there any in the hopper oh there is some
 

613
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,790
there any in the hopper oh there is some
good so that I'll pick up a few

614
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:39,800
good so that I'll pick up a few
 

615
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:48,270
good so that I'll pick up a few
snowballs but this will be the main one

616
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,280

 

617
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,730

we do that and then have a double chest

618
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:51,740
we do that and then have a double chest
 

619
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,080
we do that and then have a double chest
below we need a big storage tank for the

620
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,090
below we need a big storage tank for the
 

621
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,290
below we need a big storage tank for the
snowballs you like double chests there

622
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,300
snowballs you like double chests there
 

623
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,660
snowballs you like double chests there
then we need hoppers again so Auto

624
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:04,670
then we need hoppers again so Auto
 

625
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,060
then we need hoppers again so Auto
hoppers I forget how to make hoppers

626
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,070
hoppers I forget how to make hoppers
 

627
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,390
hoppers I forget how to make hoppers
chess just like that okay all right if

628
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,400
chess just like that okay all right if
 

629
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,740
chess just like that okay all right if
we do it this way we'll need some way of

630
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:17,750
we do it this way we'll need some way of
 

631
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,760
we do it this way we'll need some way of
getting down here to access the chest -

632
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:20,770
getting down here to access the chest -
 

633
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,120
getting down here to access the chest -
or at least the very bottom one that's

634
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,130
or at least the very bottom one that's
 

635
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,710
or at least the very bottom one that's
two double chests I would like at least

636
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
two double chests I would like at least
 

637
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,760
two double chests I would like at least
three I think

638

worked really good because normally the

812
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:44,590
worked really good because normally the
 

813
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,340
worked really good because normally the
withers rate in your face and on the

814
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:47,350
withers rate in your face and on the
 

815
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,460
withers rate in your face and on the
horse here it's like you can keep your

816
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,470
horse here it's like you can keep your
 

817
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,620
horse here it's like you can keep your
distance and he can't hit you and you

818
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:52,630
distance and he can't hit you and you
 

819
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,530
distance and he can't hit you and you
can still shoot like you when you pull

820
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:55,540
can still shoot like you when you pull

back on a bone normally you did a speed

822
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:57,220
back on a bone normally you did a speed
 

823
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,980
back on a bone normally you did a speed
reduction but I think on a horse you can

824
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:58,990
reduction but I think on a horse you can
 

825
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,160
reduction but I think on a horse you can
keep moving yeah look at this

826
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,170

 

827
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,310
