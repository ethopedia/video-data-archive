00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,269
today
we are gonna be working on this mushroom

16
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
we are gonna be working on this mushroom
 

17
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,630
we are gonna be working on this mushroom
farm some more we're gonna try to get it

18
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
farm some more we're gonna try to get it
 

19
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,349
farm some more we're gonna try to get it
done today

20
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
done today
 

21
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,750
done today
uh to start off with hopefully doesn't

22
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
uh to start off with hopefully doesn't
 

23
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,269
uh to start off with hopefully doesn't
take too long

24
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
take too long
 

25
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,790
take too long
we did work out most of the design

26
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
we did work out most of the design
 

27
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,390
we did work out most of the design
before like we got the the double

28
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
before like we got the the double
 

29
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,750
before like we got the the double
extender thing

30
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
extender thing
 

31
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,830
extender thing
figured out here that's to push the

32
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
figured out here that's to push the
 

33
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,590
figured out here that's to push the
mushroom stock out of the hole so we can

34
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
mushroom stock out of the hole so we can
 

35
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,430
mushroom stock out of the hole so we can
harvest it easy

36
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
harvest it easy
 

37
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,350
harvest it easy
and also uh got tipped off on a cool

38
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
and also uh got tipped off on a cool
 

39
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,389
and also uh got tipped off on a cool
trick that apparently azuma did recently

40
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
trick that apparently azuma did recently
 

41
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,229
trick that apparently azuma did recently
in one of his mushroom farms so we're

42
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
in one of his mushroom farms so we're
 

43
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,470
in one of his mushroom farms so we're
going to grow the mushrooms on

44
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
going to grow the mushrooms on
 

45
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,910
going to grow the mushrooms on
podzol here so the special thing about

46
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
podzol here so the special thing about
 

47
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,830
podzol here so the special thing about
podzol

48
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
podzol
 

49
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
podzol
is like if you try to grow a mushroom on

50
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
is like if you try to grow a mushroom on
 

51
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,029
is like if you try to grow a mushroom on
grass

52
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
grass
 

53
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,229
grass
out in the open broad daylights does not

54
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
out in the open broad daylights does not
 

55
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:58,630
out in the open broad daylights does not
work

56
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
work
 

57
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,310
work
because there's too much sunlight so you

58
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
because there's too much sunlight so you
 

59
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,910
because there's too much sunlight so you
got to build like a sun shield which is

60
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
got to build like a sun shield which is
 

61
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,590
got to build like a sun shield which is
what we were doing over here

62
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
what we were doing over here
 

63
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,270
what we were doing over here
to block out some of the lighting so you

64
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
to block out some of the lighting so you
 

65
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,630
to block out some of the lighting so you
can actually plant down

66
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
can actually plant down
 

67
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,750
can actually plant down
the mushroom if you do it on mycelium

68
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
the mushroom if you do it on mycelium
 

69
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,950
the mushroom if you do it on mycelium
though it does allow you to grow it

70
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
though it does allow you to grow it
 

71
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,149
though it does allow you to grow it
in broad daylight or in the open sun

72
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
in broad daylight or in the open sun
 

73
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,910
in broad daylight or in the open sun
so you can actually plant it there and

74
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
so you can actually plant it there and
 

75
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,990
so you can actually plant it there and
then grow it

76
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
then grow it
 

77
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,590
then grow it
if you have enough space you need a 7x7

78
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
if you have enough space you need a 7x7
 

79
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,070
if you have enough space you need a 7x7
area to grow a big mushroom

80
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
area to grow a big mushroom
 

81
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,910
area to grow a big mushroom
uh-huh and try again

82
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
uh-huh and try again
 

83
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,469
uh-huh and try again
there we go that time it works so you

84
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
there we go that time it works so you
 

85
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,830
there we go that time it works so you
can do that the problem is

86
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
can do that the problem is
 

87
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,230
can do that the problem is
after a while that mycelium is going to

88
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
after a while that mycelium is going to
 

89
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,069
after a while that mycelium is going to
die because there's a block over top of

90
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
die because there's a block over top of
 

91
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,550
die because there's a block over top of
it the mushroom stem

92
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
it the mushroom stem
 

93
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,990
it the mushroom stem
so this is going to turn back to regular

94
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
so this is going to turn back to regular
 

95
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,149
so this is going to turn back to regular
dirt after a little bit of time here

96
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
dirt after a little bit of time here
 

97
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,230
dirt after a little bit of time here
uh cool thing about bodzill is it works

98
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
uh cool thing about bodzill is it works
 

99
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,510
uh cool thing about bodzill is it works
just like mycelium except it doesn't die

100
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
just like mycelium except it doesn't die
 

101
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,149
just like mycelium except it doesn't die
so you can plant the mushroom on it and

102
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
so you can plant the mushroom on it and
 

103
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,109
so you can plant the mushroom on it and
grow it

104
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
grow it
 

105
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,789
grow it
this is gonna stay as possible though

106
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
this is gonna stay as possible though
 

107
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,310
this is gonna stay as possible though
this you can see it just turned back to

108
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
this you can see it just turned back to
 

109
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,870
this you can see it just turned back to
dirt

110
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
dirt
 

111
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,910
dirt
it died uh-huh so we're gonna

112
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
it died uh-huh so we're gonna
 

113
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,550
it died uh-huh so we're gonna
we're gonna use podzol in our farm why

114
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
we're gonna use podzol in our farm why
 

115
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,230
we're gonna use podzol in our farm why
can't i sprint

116
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
can't i sprint
 

117
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,069
can't i sprint
oh i am sprinting i just feel slow

118
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
oh i am sprinting i just feel slow
 

119
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,469
oh i am sprinting i just feel slow
because i don't have the speed beacon

120
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
because i don't have the speed beacon
 

121
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,990
because i don't have the speed beacon
get so used to it and then when it's

122
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
get so used to it and then when it's
 

123
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,790
get so used to it and then when it's
gone it's it's weird

124
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
gone it's it's weird
 

125
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,630
gone it's it's weird
uh-huh okay so what we're gonna do is

126
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
uh-huh okay so what we're gonna do is
 

127
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:16,949
uh-huh okay so what we're gonna do is
put

128
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
put
 

129
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,110
put
four mushrooms diagonal of the middle

130
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
four mushrooms diagonal of the middle
 

131
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,030
four mushrooms diagonal of the middle
one here the one we're actually

132
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
one here the one we're actually
 

133
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,350
one here the one we're actually
to turn into the big mushroom hopefully

134
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
to turn into the big mushroom hopefully
 

135
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,430
to turn into the big mushroom hopefully
it'll be able to spread to this block

136
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
it'll be able to spread to this block
 

137
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,150
it'll be able to spread to this block
the bodzill block fairly quickly that

138
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
the bodzill block fairly quickly that
 

139
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,910
the bodzill block fairly quickly that
way we might not even need to replant

140
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
way we might not even need to replant
 

141
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,990
way we might not even need to replant
the mushrooms there's a spread and

142
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
the mushrooms there's a spread and
 

143
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,910
the mushrooms there's a spread and
then we just grow it with the bone meal

144
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
then we just grow it with the bone meal
 

145
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,229
then we just grow it with the bone meal
in the dispenser here

146
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
in the dispenser here
 

147
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,509
in the dispenser here
that's another thing we got to work out

148
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
that's another thing we got to work out
 

149
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,030
that's another thing we got to work out
is how we're going to get bone meal into

150
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
is how we're going to get bone meal into
 

151
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,150
is how we're going to get bone meal into
these dispensers

152
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
these dispensers
 

153
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,430
these dispensers
i figure probably the easiest

154
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
i figure probably the easiest
 

155
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,110
i figure probably the easiest
way of doing this is to set up three

156
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
way of doing this is to set up three
 

157
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,830
way of doing this is to set up three
hoppers on each of these farms

158
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
hoppers on each of these farms
 

159
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,869
hoppers on each of these farms
because there's going to be more than

160
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
because there's going to be more than
 

161
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,229
because there's going to be more than
just one one mushroom there's gonna be

162
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
just one one mushroom there's gonna be
 

163
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,509
just one one mushroom there's gonna be
like 30 or 40

164
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
like 30 or 40
 

165
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,830
like 30 or 40
in the whole farm uh but yeah set up

166
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
in the whole farm uh but yeah set up
 

167
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,070
in the whole farm uh but yeah set up
three of these

168
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
three of these
 

169
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,229
three of these
put down some packed ice for a water

170
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
put down some packed ice for a water
 

171
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,430
put down some packed ice for a water
stream

172
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
stream
 

173
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,229
stream
uh make sure this is blocked off get

174
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
uh make sure this is blocked off get
 

175
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,430
uh make sure this is blocked off get
down some water

176
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
down some water
 

177
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,430
down some water
and then just like with a dropper or

178
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
and then just like with a dropper or
 

179
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,750
and then just like with a dropper or
something shoot bone meal

180
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
something shoot bone meal
 

181
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,350
something shoot bone meal
into the water stream if there's space

182
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
into the water stream if there's space
 

183
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,350
into the water stream if there's space
for it to go in here it'll refill the

184
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
for it to go in here it'll refill the
 

185
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,470
for it to go in here it'll refill the
dispenser

186
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
dispenser
 

187
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,309
dispenser
uh otherwise if it's full it'll make its

188
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
uh otherwise if it's full it'll make its
 

189
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,229
uh otherwise if it's full it'll make its
way down to the next mushroom

190
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
way down to the next mushroom
 

191
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,229
way down to the next mushroom
if that's full goes the next one next

192
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
if that's full goes the next one next
 

193
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,990
if that's full goes the next one next
one all the way down the line until

194
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
one all the way down the line until
 

195
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,710
one all the way down the line until
they're all refilled and this is this

196
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
they're all refilled and this is this
 

197
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,030
they're all refilled and this is this
works out good too because this is the

198
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
works out good too because this is the
 

199
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
works out good too because this is the
level we need to stand

200
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
level we need to stand
 

201
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,229
level we need to stand
to chop down the mushrooms like right

202
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
to chop down the mushrooms like right
 

203
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,670
to chop down the mushrooms like right
over here so it'll be a block above the

204
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
over here so it'll be a block above the
 

205
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,990
over here so it'll be a block above the
water stream

206
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
water stream
 

207
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,789
water stream
like so and then we run across with our

208
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
like so and then we run across with our
 

209
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,830
like so and then we run across with our
axe

210
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
axe
 

211
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,949
axe
and chop down all the mushrooms

212
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
and chop down all the mushrooms
 

213
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,869
and chop down all the mushrooms
but uh anyways i'm gonna do most of this

214
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
but uh anyways i'm gonna do most of this
 

215
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,390
but uh anyways i'm gonna do most of this
off camera guys because we gotta copy

216
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
off camera guys because we gotta copy
 

217
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,949
off camera guys because we gotta copy
this design like 30 or 40 times

218
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
this design like 30 or 40 times
 

219
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,190
this design like 30 or 40 times
it's going to take a bit of time to do

220
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
it's going to take a bit of time to do
 

221
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,229
it's going to take a bit of time to do
that

222
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
that
 

223
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,789
that
i am going to maybe run a test before we

224
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
i am going to maybe run a test before we
 

225
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,070
i am going to maybe run a test before we
get started

226
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
get started
 

227
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,910
get started
um can can mushrooms actually spread on

228
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
um can can mushrooms actually spread on
 

229
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,710
um can can mushrooms actually spread on
podzol

230
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
podzol
 

231
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,390
podzol
i almost think we will need that sun

232
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
i almost think we will need that sun
 

233
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,750
i almost think we will need that sun
shield still

234
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
shield still
 

235
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,270
shield still
we're gonna we're gonna run a little

236
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
we're gonna we're gonna run a little
 

237
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,869
we're gonna we're gonna run a little
test here so i'm gonna put down maybe

238
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
test here so i'm gonna put down maybe
 

239
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,630
test here so i'm gonna put down maybe
brown mushroom here brown mushroom here

240
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
brown mushroom here brown mushroom here
 

241
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,710
brown mushroom here brown mushroom here
we'll see if it spreads at all

242
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
we'll see if it spreads at all
 

243
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,309
we'll see if it spreads at all
or if it needs darkness to spread

244
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
or if it needs darkness to spread
 

245
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,390
or if it needs darkness to spread
yeah we'll come back to that later but

246
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
yeah we'll come back to that later but
 

247
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:30,070
yeah we'll come back to that later but
i'm gonna get to building

248
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080

 

249
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,590

oh okay guys so it's been a couple hours

250
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
oh okay guys so it's been a couple hours
 

251
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,110
oh okay guys so it's been a couple hours
here i've been building away like a

252
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
here i've been building away like a
 

253
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
here i've been building away like a
madman and it's it's going

254
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
madman and it's it's going
 

255
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,270
madman and it's it's going
pretty good just about got it all done

256
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
pretty good just about got it all done
 

257
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,629
pretty good just about got it all done
but i thought i'd give you an update

258
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
but i thought i'd give you an update
 

259
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,550
but i thought i'd give you an update
before we totally finish it up

260
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
before we totally finish it up
 

261
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,670
before we totally finish it up
so in total there are 29

262
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
so in total there are 29
 

263
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,710
so in total there are 29
mushrooms that we're making here

264
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
mushrooms that we're making here
 

265
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,990
mushrooms that we're making here
so it goes around place it starts over

266
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so it goes around place it starts over
 

267
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,830
so it goes around place it starts over
there goes all the way around this

268
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
there goes all the way around this
 

269
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,510
there goes all the way around this
this pumpkin farm we built all the way

270
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
this pumpkin farm we built all the way
 

271
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,189
this pumpkin farm we built all the way
over to this side

272
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
over to this side
 

273
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,230
over to this side
and got most of the systems all

274
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
and got most of the systems all
 

275
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,390
and got most of the systems all
built in place there's actually quite a

276
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
built in place there's actually quite a
 

277
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,990
built in place there's actually quite a
bit to this i've

278
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
bit to this i've
 

279
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,270
bit to this i've
i've been discovering like each each

280
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
i've been discovering like each each
 

281
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,510
i've been discovering like each each
little function adds a lot to it

282
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
little function adds a lot to it
 

283
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,629
little function adds a lot to it
um oh yeah and by the way this did

284
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
um oh yeah and by the way this did
 

285
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,830
um oh yeah and by the way this did
spread so after

286
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
spread so after
 

287
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,469
spread so after
two three hours or so it only spread

288
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
two three hours or so it only spread
 

289
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:16,950
two three hours or so it only spread
once

290
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
once
 

291
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,830
once
this mushroom grew to over here which

292
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
this mushroom grew to over here which
 

293
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,510
this mushroom grew to over here which
surprised me i didn't it was gonna do

294
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
surprised me i didn't it was gonna do
 

295
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,790
surprised me i didn't it was gonna do
that but

296
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
that but
 

297
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,230
that but
man that is not very fast at all i think

298
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
man that is not very fast at all i think
 

299
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,390
man that is not very fast at all i think
i'm thinking if i was to guess the

300
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
i'm thinking if i was to guess the
 

301
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,150
i'm thinking if i was to guess the
darkness actually does affect the spread

302
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
darkness actually does affect the spread
 

303
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,189
darkness actually does affect the spread
rate

304
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
rate
 

305
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,029
rate
um because this one over here i've also

306
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
um because this one over here i've also
 

307
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,990
um because this one over here i've also
been testing it it seems to spread every

308
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
been testing it it seems to spread every
 

309
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,390
been testing it it seems to spread every
maybe 20 minutes or so it's not great

310
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
maybe 20 minutes or so it's not great
 

311
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,350
maybe 20 minutes or so it's not great
either but it does happen

312
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
either but it does happen
 

313
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,029
either but it does happen
a lot faster than that's been working

314
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
a lot faster than that's been working
 

315
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,390
a lot faster than that's been working
anyways

316
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
anyways
 

317
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,270
anyways
so let's take a look at what we got here

318
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
so let's take a look at what we got here
 

319
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,230
so let's take a look at what we got here
um

320
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
um
 

321
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,830
um
got our controls for the two pistons up

322
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
got our controls for the two pistons up
 

323
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,029
got our controls for the two pistons up
there let's hit some repeaters over here

324
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
there let's hit some repeaters over here
 

325
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,390
there let's hit some repeaters over here
this is our main wire

326
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
this is our main wire
 

327
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,830
this is our main wire
for controlling uh pushing the

328
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
for controlling uh pushing the
 

329
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,150
for controlling uh pushing the
the mushroom stocks out of the hole and

330
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
the mushroom stocks out of the hole and
 

331
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,909
the mushroom stocks out of the hole and
on the other side there's another wire

332
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
on the other side there's another wire
 

333
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,670
on the other side there's another wire
as well for controlling the the bone

334
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
as well for controlling the the bone
 

335
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,390
as well for controlling the the bone
meal and this

336
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
meal and this
 

337
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,230
meal and this
the dispenser that just runs underneath

338
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
the dispenser that just runs underneath
 

339
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,749
the dispenser that just runs underneath
the ice

340
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
the ice
 

341
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,270
the ice
path here all the way down and right now

342
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
path here all the way down and right now
 

343
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,110
path here all the way down and right now
i'm working on a way of picking up the

344
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
i'm working on a way of picking up the
 

345
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,790
i'm working on a way of picking up the
mushroom drops after we chop down the

346
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
mushroom drops after we chop down the
 

347
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,749
mushroom drops after we chop down the
mushrooms we want to

348
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
mushrooms we want to
 

349
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,189
mushrooms we want to
we want to collect them all together

350
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
we want to collect them all together
 

351
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,790
we want to collect them all together
automatically right so

352
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
automatically right so
 

353
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,469
automatically right so
i'm thinking we'll do something like

354
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
i'm thinking we'll do something like
 

355
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,070
i'm thinking we'll do something like
this

356
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
this
 

357
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,390
this
have the minecart bounce from one to the

358
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
have the minecart bounce from one to the
 

359
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,830
have the minecart bounce from one to the
next to the next

360
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
next to the next
 

361
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,629
next to the next
uh this will be a hopper minecart and

362
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
uh this will be a hopper minecart and
 

363
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,430
uh this will be a hopper minecart and
that will run

364
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
that will run
 

365
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,270
that will run
underneath this podzole block here so if

366
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
underneath this podzole block here so if
 

367
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,350
underneath this podzole block here so if
any mushroom blocks are on top of this

368
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
any mushroom blocks are on top of this
 

369
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,029
any mushroom blocks are on top of this
this puzzle block it'll pick it up

370
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
this puzzle block it'll pick it up
 

371
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,550
this puzzle block it'll pick it up
through the the block

372
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
through the the block
 

373
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,309
through the the block
as it passes underneath here is my plan

374
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
as it passes underneath here is my plan
 

375
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,670
as it passes underneath here is my plan
um so should be fairly simple to do just

376
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
um so should be fairly simple to do just
 

377
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,270
um so should be fairly simple to do just
gotta run

378
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
gotta run
 

379
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,390
gotta run
a rail line over to here at the junction

380
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
a rail line over to here at the junction
 

381
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,749
a rail line over to here at the junction
we need a

382
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
we need a
 

383
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,189
we need a
detector rail and as long as the

384
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
detector rail and as long as the
 

385
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,390
detector rail and as long as the
minecart's not moving

386
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
minecart's not moving
 

387
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,710
minecart's not moving
super fast this should work it might

388
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
super fast this should work it might
 

389
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,950
super fast this should work it might
need a little bit of tweaking

390
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
need a little bit of tweaking
 

391
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,710
need a little bit of tweaking
but yeah this as it passes over this

392
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
but yeah this as it passes over this
 

393
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,029
but yeah this as it passes over this
it'll flip this junction to go this way

394
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
it'll flip this junction to go this way
 

395
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,230
it'll flip this junction to go this way
and then when it comes back it'll be

396
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
and then when it comes back it'll be
 

397
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,749
and then when it comes back it'll be
going that way

398
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759

 

399
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,029

all right guys cool so we're just

400
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
all right guys cool so we're just
 

401
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,469
all right guys cool so we're just
testing out the rail line here seems

402
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
testing out the rail line here seems
 

403
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,390
testing out the rail line here seems
like it's going to make it all the way

404
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
like it's going to make it all the way
 

405
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,550
like it's going to make it all the way
uh so we got everything done down below

406
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
uh so we got everything done down below
 

407
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,070
uh so we got everything done down below
here all the redstone all the

408
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
here all the redstone all the
 

409
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,029
here all the redstone all the
rail line stuff should be good passes

410
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
rail line stuff should be good passes
 

411
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,710
rail line stuff should be good passes
underneath the bottle block for

412
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
underneath the bottle block for
 

413
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,469
underneath the bottle block for
for each of the mushrooms so when we

414
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
for each of the mushrooms so when we
 

415
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,990
for each of the mushrooms so when we
wash it drops

416
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
wash it drops
 

417
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,550
wash it drops
uh towards that puzzle block it's gonna

418
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
uh towards that puzzle block it's gonna
 

419
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,909
uh towards that puzzle block it's gonna
it's gonna pick them up

420
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
it's gonna pick them up
 

421
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,430
it's gonna pick them up
and every mushroom we chop down is going

422
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
and every mushroom we chop down is going
 

423
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,110
and every mushroom we chop down is going
to give us about a stack of mushroom

424
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
to give us about a stack of mushroom
 

425
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,070
to give us about a stack of mushroom
blocks

426
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
blocks
 

427
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,830
blocks
a hopper minecart can only hold five

428
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
a hopper minecart can only hold five
 

429
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,510
a hopper minecart can only hold five
stacks though so that means we probably

430
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
stacks though so that means we probably
 

431
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,029
stacks though so that means we probably
need to send

432
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
need to send
 

433
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,670
need to send
like six hopper minecarts to pick up the

434
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
like six hopper minecarts to pick up the
 

435
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,430
like six hopper minecarts to pick up the
drops from the whole farm

436
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
drops from the whole farm
 

437
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,469
drops from the whole farm
um is the plan but yeah we're gonna

438
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
um is the plan but yeah we're gonna
 

439
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,309
um is the plan but yeah we're gonna
start sealing this up and then we gotta

440
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
start sealing this up and then we gotta
 

441
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,070
start sealing this up and then we gotta
work on the water stream and then we're

442
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
work on the water stream and then we're
 

443
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,909
work on the water stream and then we're
we're like done with this

444
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
we're like done with this
 

445
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,950
we're like done with this
and some of the control things too and

446
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
and some of the control things too and
 

447
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,869
and some of the control things too and
and this and that and a whole bunch of

448
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
and this and that and a whole bunch of
 

449
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,550
and this and that and a whole bunch of
other things this is taking quite a bit

450
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
other things this is taking quite a bit
 

451
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,710
other things this is taking quite a bit
of time there's a lot to this actually

452
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
of time there's a lot to this actually
 

453
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,830
of time there's a lot to this actually
so this is what it's going to look like

454
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
so this is what it's going to look like
 

455
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,909
so this is what it's going to look like
when it's all sealed up there'll be

456
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
when it's all sealed up there'll be
 

457
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,990
when it's all sealed up there'll be
mushroom stock right here and here so

458
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
mushroom stock right here and here so
 

459
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
mushroom stock right here and here so
it's just going to be a one by one hole

460
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
it's just going to be a one by one hole
 

461
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,070
it's just going to be a one by one hole
and all these uh spreading mushrooms

462
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
and all these uh spreading mushrooms
 

463
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,830
and all these uh spreading mushrooms
will be protected

464
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
will be protected
 

465
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,189
will be protected
they're not going to get washed away or

466
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
they're not going to get washed away or
 

467
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,510
they're not going to get washed away or
anything uh so yeah basically

468
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
anything uh so yeah basically
 

469
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,589
anything uh so yeah basically
just gotta start filling this back in

470
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
just gotta start filling this back in
 

471
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,110
just gotta start filling this back in
all around here because we only want

472
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
all around here because we only want
 

473
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,629
all around here because we only want
these mushrooms to be able to spread to

474
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
these mushrooms to be able to spread to
 

475
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,830
these mushrooms to be able to spread to
this middle block we don't want them

476
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
this middle block we don't want them
 

477
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,350
this middle block we don't want them
spreading anywhere else we gotta be

478
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
spreading anywhere else we gotta be
 

479
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,629
spreading anywhere else we gotta be
careful

480
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
careful
 

481
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,830
careful
like if we left this this spot open here

482
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
like if we left this this spot open here
 

483
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,110
like if we left this this spot open here
they would spread to that we got to make

484
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
they would spread to that we got to make
 

485
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,830
they would spread to that we got to make
sure that's all sealed up

486
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
sure that's all sealed up
 

487
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,589
sure that's all sealed up
okay although

488
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599

 

489
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,509

no ev they won't spread to the piston

490
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
no ev they won't spread to the piston
 

491
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,350
no ev they won't spread to the piston
here because the mushroom stock will be

492
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
here because the mushroom stock will be
 

493
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,190
here because the mushroom stock will be
here

494
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
here
 

495
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,709
here
yeah cause they can spread to things

496
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah cause they can spread to things
 

497
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,030
yeah cause they can spread to things
besides dirt i think they can spread the

498
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
besides dirt i think they can spread the
 

499
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,790
besides dirt i think they can spread the
stone in all kinds of blocks so

500
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
stone in all kinds of blocks so
 

501
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,150
stone in all kinds of blocks so
definitely got to make sure this is

502
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
definitely got to make sure this is
 

503
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,509
definitely got to make sure this is
sealed up well

504
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519

 

505
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,710

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,150
couldn't swim in water anymore i thought
they sink when they go in the water

510
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
they sink when they go in the water

513
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,509

oh man now i need to investigate

514
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
oh man now i need to investigate
 

515
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,030
oh man now i need to investigate
i'm not crazy right like they weren't

516
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
i'm not crazy right like they weren't
 

517
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,870
i'm not crazy right like they weren't
able to swim for a long time

518
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
able to swim for a long time
 

519
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,190
able to swim for a long time
and now they can again i don't know if

520
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
and now they can again i don't know if
 

521

and now they can again i don't know if
it's this snapshot that changed it

522
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
it's this snapshot that changed it
 

523
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,150
it's this snapshot that changed it
or if it happened a while ago but yeah

524
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
or if it happened a while ago but yeah
 

525
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,269
or if it happened a while ago but yeah
they can swim again look at that

526
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
they can swim again look at that
 

527
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,829
they can swim again look at that
anyways got a little sidetracked this

528
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
anyways got a little sidetracked this
 

529
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,190
anyways got a little sidetracked this
game is weird like that though like

530
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
game is weird like that though like
 

531
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,350
game is weird like that though like
you'll see something and it's like

532
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
you'll see something and it's like
 

533
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,430
you'll see something and it's like
did i did i get the facts wrong on that

534
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
did i did i get the facts wrong on that
 

535
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,150
did i did i get the facts wrong on that
has it changed when did it change

536
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
has it changed when did it change
 

537
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,670
has it changed when did it change
because like they could swim and then

538
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
because like they could swim and then
 

539
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,509
because like they could swim and then
they couldn't swim and now they can swim

540
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
they couldn't swim and now they can swim
 

541
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,630
they couldn't swim and now they can swim
again

542
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
again
 

543
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,990
again
and now i'm wondering like was there

544
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
and now i'm wondering like was there
 

545
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,030
and now i'm wondering like was there
ever a point where they actually

546
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
ever a point where they actually
 

547
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,710
ever a point where they actually
couldn't swim

548
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
couldn't swim
 

549
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,070
couldn't swim
or am i making that up uh

550
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
or am i making that up uh
 

551
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,630
or am i making that up uh
okay so it looks like we've converted

552
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
okay so it looks like we've converted
 

553
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,110
okay so it looks like we've converted
most of our bones here

554
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
most of our bones here
 

555
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,389
most of our bones here
don't you just love looking through

556
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
don't you just love looking through
 

557
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,389
don't you just love looking through
chests what we got to do now is fill up

558
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
chests what we got to do now is fill up
 

559
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,710
chests what we got to do now is fill up
those dispensers with bone meal

560
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
those dispensers with bone meal
 

561
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,750
those dispensers with bone meal
and then we should hopefully be able to

562
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
and then we should hopefully be able to
 

563
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,269
and then we should hopefully be able to
try out that mushroom farm it's just

564
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
try out that mushroom farm it's just
 

565
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,310
try out that mushroom farm it's just
about done

566
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
about done
 

567
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,670
about done
is a huge project though let's see

568
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
is a huge project though let's see
 

569
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,670
is a huge project though let's see
what we really need to do sometime is

570
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
what we really need to do sometime is
 

571
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,870
what we really need to do sometime is
build an elevator

572
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
build an elevator
 

573
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,190
build an elevator
like in this village because there's no

574
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
like in this village because there's no
 

575
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,550
like in this village because there's no
there's no good way of getting up to the

576
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
there's no good way of getting up to the
 

577
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,630
there's no good way of getting up to the
surface from here

578
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
surface from here
 

579
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,590
surface from here
so usually what i do now is like i just

580
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
so usually what i do now is like i just
 

581
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,190
so usually what i do now is like i just
do this

582
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
do this
 

583
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,590
do this
now that we can fly it's the best way of

584
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
now that we can fly it's the best way of
 

585
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,750
now that we can fly it's the best way of
getting out

586
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
getting out
 

587
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,710
getting out
okay cool so we got the ground refilled

588
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
okay cool so we got the ground refilled
 

589
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,030
okay cool so we got the ground refilled
in

590
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
in
 

591
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,190
in
at the mushroom farm here so basically i

592
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
at the mushroom farm here so basically i
 

593
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,030
at the mushroom farm here so basically i
chopped out all the dirt then i built

594
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
chopped out all the dirt then i built
 

595
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,550
chopped out all the dirt then i built
the redstone components

596
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
the redstone components
 

597
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,190
the redstone components
and then i refilled in the dirts maybe

598
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
and then i refilled in the dirts maybe
 

599
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,550
and then i refilled in the dirts maybe
not the best way of doing it but it sure

600
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
not the best way of doing it but it sure
 

601
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,990
not the best way of doing it but it sure
made the redstone part of this a lot

602
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
made the redstone part of this a lot
 

603
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,110
made the redstone part of this a lot
easier

604
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
easier
 

605
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,190
easier
um decide to use coarse dirt for the

606
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
um decide to use coarse dirt for the
 

607
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,310
um decide to use coarse dirt for the
ground here because it's

608
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
ground here because it's
 

609
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,710
ground here because it's
it's probably going to look better than

610
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
it's probably going to look better than
 

611
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,829
it's probably going to look better than
this green grass right

612
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
this green grass right
 

613
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,190
this green grass right
hopefully could probably make this look

614
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
hopefully could probably make this look
 

615
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,790
hopefully could probably make this look
a lot better if i tried

616
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
a lot better if i tried
 

617
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,790
a lot better if i tried
it's just one type of block i could mix

618
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
it's just one type of block i could mix
 

619
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,710
it's just one type of block i could mix
mix other things in with it

620
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
mix other things in with it
 

621
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,710
mix other things in with it
but honestly at this point i just kind

622
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
but honestly at this point i just kind
 

623
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,069
but honestly at this point i just kind
of wanted to get this done

624
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
of wanted to get this done
 

625
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,430
of wanted to get this done
because i've been working on it for so

626
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
because i've been working on it for so
 

627
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,590
because i've been working on it for so
long um

628
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
long um
 

629
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,509
long um
tried orange clay decided orange

630
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
tried orange clay decided orange
 

631
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,870
tried orange clay decided orange
sandstone looks better because it has

632
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
sandstone looks better because it has
 

633
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,509
sandstone looks better because it has
more texture

634
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
more texture
 

635
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,990
more texture
and maybe not the best block choice

636
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
and maybe not the best block choice
 

637
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,790
and maybe not the best block choice
either but we will roll with it

638
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
either but we will roll with it
 

639
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,389
either but we will roll with it
left a little bit of a crawl space down

640
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
left a little bit of a crawl space down
 

641
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,870
left a little bit of a crawl space down
here too so we can actually

642
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
here too so we can actually
 

643
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,550
here too so we can actually
check out the redstone and the rail line

644
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
check out the redstone and the rail line
 

645
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,990
check out the redstone and the rail line
stuff if we need to

646
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
stuff if we need to
 

647
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,910
stuff if we need to
down the road and now i've got the water

648
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
down the road and now i've got the water
 

649
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,430
down the road and now i've got the water
streams in

650
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
streams in
 

651
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,750
streams in
so i'm going to start filling up the

652
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
so i'm going to start filling up the
 

653
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,110
so i'm going to start filling up the
dispensers with bone meal

654
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
dispensers with bone meal
 

655
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,710
dispensers with bone meal
the easiest way to do that initially

656
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
the easiest way to do that initially
 

657
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,310
the easiest way to do that initially
here is just to throw in stacks and

658
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
here is just to throw in stacks and
 

659
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,190
here is just to throw in stacks and
stacks

660
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
stacks
 

661
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,790
stacks
of bone meal they'll go where they need

662
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
of bone meal they'll go where they need
 

663

i hate when you do that when you search

836
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
i hate when you do that when you search
 

837
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,110
i hate when you do that when you search
for a mob and then you just end up

838
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
for a mob and then you just end up
 

839
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,710
for a mob and then you just end up
making a big hole you can't find them

840
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720

 

841
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,910

because i'm gonna have to fill this back

842
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
because i'm gonna have to fill this back
 

843
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,670
because i'm gonna have to fill this back
in now no i still can't find it

844
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
in now no i still can't find it
 

845
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,509
in now no i still can't find it
this way there you are

846
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
this way there you are
 

847
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,670
this way there you are
okay oh hey

848
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
okay oh hey
 

849
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,030
okay oh hey
is there a tape here oh

850
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
is there a tape here oh
 

851
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,350
is there a tape here oh
let's get let's let him blow up if we

852
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
let's get let's let him blow up if we
 

853
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,230
let's get let's let him blow up if we
can

854
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
can
 

855
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,110
can
just don't blow me up now okay

856
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120

 

857
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,829

yeah there is there's a bit of a cave

858
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
yeah there is there's a bit of a cave
 

859
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,710
yeah there is there's a bit of a cave
here

860
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
here
 

861
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,670
here
oh wow okay

862
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680

 

863
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,670

let's check this out real quick uh

864
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
let's check this out real quick uh
 

865
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,269
let's check this out real quick uh
yeah it keeps going here okay well we'll

866
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
yeah it keeps going here okay well we'll
 

867
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,509
yeah it keeps going here okay well we'll
just light up the top part here

868
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
just light up the top part here
 

869
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,189
just light up the top part here
and cover it up so for the redstone here

870
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
and cover it up so for the redstone here
 

871
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,629
and cover it up so for the redstone here
i think we've got to get this repeater

872
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
i think we've got to get this repeater
 

873
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,670
i think we've got to get this repeater
at four

874
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
at four
 

875
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,430
at four
and just set up a monostable circuit

876
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
and just set up a monostable circuit
 

877
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,829
and just set up a monostable circuit
here so basically if you

878
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
here so basically if you
 

879
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,910
here so basically if you
run a wire to that this should be good

880
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
run a wire to that this should be good
 

881
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,749
run a wire to that this should be good
that'll activate the

882
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
that'll activate the
 

883
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,110
that'll activate the
mushroom stock pusher mechanism and then

884
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
mushroom stock pusher mechanism and then
 

885
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,790
mushroom stock pusher mechanism and then
for the bone meal thing we want to run a

886
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
for the bone meal thing we want to run a
 

887
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,150
for the bone meal thing we want to run a
clock

888
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
clock
 

889
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,470
clock
uh while a lever is flipped probably so

890
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
uh while a lever is flipped probably so
 

891
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,949
uh while a lever is flipped probably so
this we will turn

892
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
this we will turn
 

893
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,470
this we will turn
or we will set up how let's put a

894
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
or we will set up how let's put a
 

895
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,470
or we will set up how let's put a
repeater here one two

896
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
repeater here one two
 

897
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,590
repeater here one two
three blocks from a comparator just do a

898
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
three blocks from a comparator just do a
 

899
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,670
three blocks from a comparator just do a
comparator clock

900
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
comparator clock
 

901
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,350
comparator clock
flip that and this has to run back

902
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
flip that and this has to run back
 

903
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,069
flip that and this has to run back
like i saw and that should be good and

904
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
like i saw and that should be good and
 

905
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,870
like i saw and that should be good and
then just put a repeater behind that's

906
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
then just put a repeater behind that's
 

907
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,910
then just put a repeater behind that's
good so if we run a signal to that then

908
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
good so if we run a signal to that then
 

909
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,150
good so if we run a signal to that then
it's going to grow the mushrooms

910
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
it's going to grow the mushrooms
 

911
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,670
it's going to grow the mushrooms
okay let's run this up here so we can

912
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
okay let's run this up here so we can
 

913
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,269
okay let's run this up here so we can
see it happening now some people

914
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
see it happening now some people
 

915
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,949
see it happening now some people
suggested like you can

916
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
suggested like you can
 

917
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,870
suggested like you can
you can set this up so the mushrooms

918
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
you can set this up so the mushrooms
 

919
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,230
you can set this up so the mushrooms
grow automatically

920
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
grow automatically
 

921
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,670
grow automatically
i think it's actually going to be pretty

922
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
i think it's actually going to be pretty
 

923
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,150
i think it's actually going to be pretty
cool here if we

924
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
cool here if we
 

925
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,350
cool here if we
control when it happens because we're

926
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
control when it happens because we're
 

927
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,829
control when it happens because we're
going to see them all grow at once

928
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
going to see them all grow at once
 

929
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,990
going to see them all grow at once
which is something i can't say i've ever

930
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
which is something i can't say i've ever
 

931
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,350
which is something i can't say i've ever
seen before in minecraft it's going to

932
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
seen before in minecraft it's going to
 

933
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,110
seen before in minecraft it's going to
be pretty cool i think

934
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
be pretty cool i think
 

935
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,949
be pretty cool i think
so let's let's try this out so we got

936
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
so let's let's try this out so we got
 

937
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,390
so let's let's try this out so we got
nothing right now and then there should

938
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
nothing right now and then there should
 

939
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,949
nothing right now and then there should
just be

940
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
just be
 

941
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,429
just be
a whole bunch of blocks all of a sudden

942
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
a whole bunch of blocks all of a sudden
 

943
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,630
a whole bunch of blocks all of a sudden
okay here we go

944
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640

 

945
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,829

yep yep oh oh i didn't put the covering

946
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
yep yep oh oh i didn't put the covering
 

947
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,829
yep yep oh oh i didn't put the covering
over that

948
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
over that
 

949
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,270
over that
no i was supposed to put string above

950
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
no i was supposed to put string above
 

951
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,470
no i was supposed to put string above
the mushrooms so

952
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
the mushrooms so
 

953
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,150
the mushrooms so
they don't grow all the way

954
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
they don't grow all the way
 

955
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,230
they don't grow all the way
okay a little bit of a derp up there

956
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
okay a little bit of a derp up there
 

957
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,070
okay a little bit of a derp up there
uh but this is okay where we had the sun

958
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
uh but this is okay where we had the sun
 

959
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,669
uh but this is okay where we had the sun
shield

960
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
shield
 

961
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,630
shield
alright and then after we grow them we

962
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
alright and then after we grow them we
 

963
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,630
alright and then after we grow them we
want to trigger this

964
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
want to trigger this
 

965
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,510
want to trigger this
uh should just need a button push let's

966
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
uh should just need a button push let's
 

967
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:39,990
uh should just need a button push let's
see

968
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
see
 

969
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,789
see
stone i need stone oh we need

970
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
stone i need stone oh we need
 

971
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,990
stone i need stone oh we need
oh they're still finding their way up

972
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
oh they're still finding their way up
 

973
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,110
oh they're still finding their way up
here aren't they

974
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120

 

975
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,029

um okay i might have to explore that off

976
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
um okay i might have to explore that off
 

977
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,110
um okay i might have to explore that off
camera

978
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
camera
 

979
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,310
camera
light it all up okay

980
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
light it all up okay
 

981
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,950
light it all up okay
yeah let's just put down a button over

982
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
yeah let's just put down a button over
 

983
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,110
yeah let's just put down a button over
here that'll push the mushroom

984
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
here that'll push the mushroom
 

985
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,110
here that'll push the mushroom
stocks out of the hole

986
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120

 

987
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,150

all right or i guess the first time we

988
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
all right or i guess the first time we
 

989
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,150
all right or i guess the first time we
use it it's going to put them over there

990
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
use it it's going to put them over there
 

991
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,549
use it it's going to put them over there
so now we got this we all we got this

992
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
so now we got this we all we got this
 

993
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,750
so now we got this we all we got this
all done we just have to run down here

994
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
all done we just have to run down here
 

995
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,510
all done we just have to run down here
like so the only thing we're missing

996
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
like so the only thing we're missing
 

997
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,190
like so the only thing we're missing
right now

998
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
right now
 

999
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,950
right now
a couple things actually we're missing

1000
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
a couple things actually we're missing
 

1001
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,830
a couple things actually we're missing
the water stream stuff and we're missing

1002
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
the water stream stuff and we're missing
 

1003
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,990
the water stream stuff and we're missing
uh some of the minecart control stuff

1004
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
uh some of the minecart control stuff
 

1005
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,830
uh some of the minecart control stuff
like the minecart's not running

1006
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
like the minecart's not running
 

1007
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,350
like the minecart's not running
but yeah that's pretty good right then

1008
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
but yeah that's pretty good right then
 

1009
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,270
but yeah that's pretty good right then
on this side you do it as well

1010
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280

 

1011
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,310

oh oh yes we ran out of sandstone there

1012
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
oh oh yes we ran out of sandstone there
 

1013
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,750
oh oh yes we ran out of sandstone there
okay so let's take a look at this how

1014
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
okay so let's take a look at this how
 

1015
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,430
okay so let's take a look at this how
did that do it looks like a couple

1016
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
did that do it looks like a couple
 

1017
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,950
did that do it looks like a couple
blocks did actually land on the

1018
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
blocks did actually land on the
 

1019
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,789
blocks did actually land on the
sandstone here and we didn't pick them

1020
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
sandstone here and we didn't pick them
 

1021
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,750
sandstone here and we didn't pick them
up as we

1022
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
up as we
 

1023
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,070
up as we
as we did this i was afraid of that i

1024
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
as we did this i was afraid of that i
 

1025
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,630
as we did this i was afraid of that i
was hoping that wouldn't happen

1026
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
was hoping that wouldn't happen
 

1027
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,830
was hoping that wouldn't happen
um maybe if we like instead of like

1028
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
um maybe if we like instead of like
 

1029
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,390
um maybe if we like instead of like
going straight across if we kind of

1030
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
going straight across if we kind of
 

1031
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,070
going straight across if we kind of
go at an angle like this as we go it

1032
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
go at an angle like this as we go it
 

1033
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,230
go at an angle like this as we go it
would be better

1034
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
would be better
 

1035
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,830
would be better
looks like we messed up the timing here

1036
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
looks like we messed up the timing here
 

1037
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,270
looks like we messed up the timing here
too there's there's still a mushroom

1038
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
too there's there's still a mushroom
 

1039
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,549
too there's there's still a mushroom
block here it should be underneath this

1040
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
block here it should be underneath this
 

1041
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,310
block here it should be underneath this
one

1042
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
one
 

1043
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,590
one
oh well uh what what did we do then i

1044
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
oh well uh what what did we do then i
 

1045
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,230
oh well uh what what did we do then i
thought i had this right

1046
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
thought i had this right
 

1047
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,909
thought i had this right
this is a five yet so it's supposed to

1048
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
this is a five yet so it's supposed to
 

1049
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,669
this is a five yet so it's supposed to
be

1050
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
be
 

1051
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,190
be
let's try change this to three

1052
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
let's try change this to three
 

1053
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,549
let's try change this to three
maybe i don't know

1054
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
maybe i don't know
 

1055
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,029
maybe i don't know
um i guess we're not gonna know until we

1056
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
um i guess we're not gonna know until we
 

1057
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,510
um i guess we're not gonna know until we
do another one

1058
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
do another one
 

1059
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,669
do another one
why is there a redstone torch here

1060
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679

 

1061
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,830

that's really bad

1062
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840

 

1063
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,190

why how

1064
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200

 

1065
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,950

oh um

1066
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960

 

1067
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,549

we might have disturbed up the whole

1068
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
we might have disturbed up the whole
 

1069
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,549
we might have disturbed up the whole
farm

1070
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
farm
 

1071
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,789
farm
yeah it broke the torch on every second

1072
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
yeah it broke the torch on every second
 

1073
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,510
yeah it broke the torch on every second
one here it looks like

1074
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
one here it looks like
 

1075
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,029
one here it looks like
oh that stinks okay uh gonna need to do

1076
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
oh that stinks okay uh gonna need to do
 

1077
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,549
oh that stinks okay uh gonna need to do
a little bit of maintenance and maybe a

1078
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
a little bit of maintenance and maybe a
 

1079
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,549
a little bit of maintenance and maybe a
little bit more testing

1080
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
little bit more testing
 

1081
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,070
little bit more testing
we did test this though i don't know

1082
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
we did test this though i don't know
 

1083
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,909
we did test this though i don't know
what i got wrong on it

1084
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
what i got wrong on it
 

1085
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,270
what i got wrong on it
like before we built the whole thing

1086
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
like before we built the whole thing
 

1087
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,830
like before we built the whole thing
here

1088
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
here
 

1089
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,310
here
okay guys well i tried really hard to

1090
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
okay guys well i tried really hard to
 

1091
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,830
okay guys well i tried really hard to
get this all done today

1092
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
get this all done today
 

1093
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,350
get this all done today
but there's still a little bit left to

1094
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
but there's still a little bit left to
 

1095
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,510
but there's still a little bit left to
do on it so i think

1096
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
do on it so i think
 

1097
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,950
do on it so i think
because i've been recording this over

1098
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
because i've been recording this over
 

1099
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,710
because i've been recording this over
several days by now

1100
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
several days by now
 

1101
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,710
several days by now
we should probably just split it into

1102
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
we should probably just split it into
 

1103
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,230
we should probably just split it into
another episode

1104
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
another episode
 

1105
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,149
another episode
uh it's close to done but there's

1106
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
uh it's close to done but there's
 

1107
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,950
uh it's close to done but there's
probably at least another two hours

1108
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
probably at least another two hours
 

1109
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,909
probably at least another two hours
left to work on it so i'll just show you

1110
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
left to work on it so i'll just show you
 

1111
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,029
left to work on it so i'll just show you
real quick here what i

1112
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
real quick here what i
 

1113
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,110
real quick here what i
intend to do to make the water streams

1114
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
intend to do to make the water streams
 

1115
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,669
intend to do to make the water streams
work so in the middle between two

1116
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
work so in the middle between two
 

1117
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,110
work so in the middle between two
mushrooms

1118
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
mushrooms
 

1119
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,430
mushrooms
uh let's see one two three four five six

1120
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
uh let's see one two three four five six
 

1121
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,149
uh let's see one two three four five six
blocks between them i'm hoping we can

1122
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
blocks between them i'm hoping we can
 

1123
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,950
blocks between them i'm hoping we can
just like put an ice block here ice

1124
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
just like put an ice block here ice
 

1125
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,710
just like put an ice block here ice
block here and then

1126
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
block here and then
 

1127
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,950
block here and then
let's see i got morning voice right now

1128
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
let's see i got morning voice right now
 

1129
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,710
let's see i got morning voice right now
too by the way

1130
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
too by the way
 

1131
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,470
too by the way
not depressed congested big difference

1132
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
not depressed congested big difference
 

1133
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,390
not depressed congested big difference
okay uh i think we would want it over

1134
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
okay uh i think we would want it over
 

1135
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,029
okay uh i think we would want it over
here yeah so hopefully with these four

1136
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
here yeah so hopefully with these four
 

1137
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,870
here yeah so hopefully with these four
water blocks

1138
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
water blocks
 

1139
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,470
water blocks
it'll be able to wash the mushroom

1140
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
it'll be able to wash the mushroom
 

1141
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,149
it'll be able to wash the mushroom
blocks into that hole

1142
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
blocks into that hole
 

1143
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,190
blocks into that hole
that gets left behind by the stem over

1144
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
that gets left behind by the stem over
 

1145
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,990
that gets left behind by the stem over
here

1146
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
here
 

1147
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,230
here
uh let's test out the water stream here

1148
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
uh let's test out the water stream here
 

1149
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,310
uh let's test out the water stream here
looks good

1150
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
looks good
 

1151
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,310
looks good
so hopefully anywhere the the mushroom

1152
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
so hopefully anywhere the the mushroom
 

1153
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,870
so hopefully anywhere the the mushroom
block lands it'll go there

1154
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
block lands it'll go there
 

1155
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,070
block lands it'll go there
and then that's where the hopper

1156
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
and then that's where the hopper
 

1157
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,909
and then that's where the hopper
minecart runs underneath it underneath

1158
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
minecart runs underneath it underneath
 

1159
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,430
minecart runs underneath it underneath
the puzzle block so it should be able to

1160
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
the puzzle block so it should be able to
 

1161
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,110
the puzzle block so it should be able to
pick up any drops

1162
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
pick up any drops
 

1163
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,990
pick up any drops
from there that is the plan i think

1164
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
from there that is the plan i think
 

1165
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,430
from there that is the plan i think
it'll work out pretty good but we got to

1166
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
it'll work out pretty good but we got to
 

1167
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,430
it'll work out pretty good but we got to
run some redstone to control the water

1168
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
run some redstone to control the water
 

1169
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,750
run some redstone to control the water
as well so there is a fair bit left to

1170
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
as well so there is a fair bit left to
 

1171
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,950
as well so there is a fair bit left to
do

1172
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
do
 

1173
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,549
do
there is one more thing we're going to

1174
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
there is one more thing we're going to
 

1175
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,909
there is one more thing we're going to
try out here together guys we're going

1176
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
try out here together guys we're going
 

1177
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,430
try out here together guys we're going
to make ourselves a

1178
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
to make ourselves a
 

1179
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,270
to make ourselves a
meta value changer which is a little bit

1180
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
meta value changer which is a little bit
 

1181
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,990
meta value changer which is a little bit
of a gray

1182
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
of a gray
 

1183
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,029
of a gray
area as far as cheating goes but i'm

1184
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
area as far as cheating goes but i'm
 

1185
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,789
area as far as cheating goes but i'm
okay with it personally i'm okay with uh

1186
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
okay with it personally i'm okay with uh
 

1187
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,310
okay with it personally i'm okay with uh
meta value changers

1188
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
meta value changers
 

1189
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,630
meta value changers
what i don't do in my world here is uh

1190
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
what i don't do in my world here is uh
 

1191
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,830
what i don't do in my world here is uh
block duplication

1192
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
block duplication
 

1193
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,230
block duplication
there's a lot of ways to like duplicate

1194
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
there's a lot of ways to like duplicate
 

1195
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,590
there's a lot of ways to like duplicate
rails or

1196
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
rails or
 

1197
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,669
rails or
or concrete there's a way of doing that

1198
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
or concrete there's a way of doing that
 

1199
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,750
or concrete there's a way of doing that
even i think sand and

1200
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
even i think sand and
 

1201
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,270
even i think sand and
some other stuff like that i've never

1202
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
some other stuff like that i've never
 

1203
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,430
some other stuff like that i've never
taken advantage of that

1204
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
taken advantage of that
 

1205
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,710
taken advantage of that
but this is just for like aesthetics

1206
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
but this is just for like aesthetics
 

1207
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,909
but this is just for like aesthetics
right

1208
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
right
 

1209
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,029
right
doesn't bother me and because

1210
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
doesn't bother me and because
 

1211
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,029
doesn't bother me and because
i have changed my world to amplified

1212
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
i have changed my world to amplified
 

1213
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,149
i have changed my world to amplified
there's actually

1214
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
there's actually
 

1215
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,149
there's actually
very little almost no red sand in my

1216
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
very little almost no red sand in my
 

1217
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,230
very little almost no red sand in my
world because it only generates in flat

1218
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
world because it only generates in flat
 

1219
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,830
world because it only generates in flat
areas

1220
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
areas
 

1221
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,310
areas
and because the terrain's amplified

1222
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
and because the terrain's amplified
 

1223
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,190
and because the terrain's amplified
there is almost no flat areas

1224
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
there is almost no flat areas
 

1225
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,029
there is almost no flat areas
so i have to really destroy the look of

1226
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
so i have to really destroy the look of
 

1227
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,029
so i have to really destroy the look of
the mesa to get it

1228
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
the mesa to get it
 

1229
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,990
the mesa to get it
that's my justification let's see if

1230
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
that's my justification let's see if
 

1231
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,510
that's my justification let's see if
this still works i'm just copying the

1232
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
this still works i'm just copying the
 

1233
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,950
this still works i'm just copying the
one that doc showed me

1234
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
one that doc showed me
 

1235
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,990
one that doc showed me
when we made that connect4 game uh let's

1236
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
when we made that connect4 game uh let's
 

1237
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,990
when we made that connect4 game uh let's
see i think

1238
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
see i think
 

1239
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,190
see i think
i think this is about right

1240
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
i think this is about right
 

1241
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,510
i think this is about right
sort of going off of memory here uh i

1242
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
sort of going off of memory here uh i
 

1243
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,390
sort of going off of memory here uh i
think i think he had redstone here

1244
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
think i think he had redstone here
 

1245
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,029
think i think he had redstone here
and then he made it come up to here to

1246
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
and then he made it come up to here to
 

1247
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,830
and then he made it come up to here to
the

1248
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:53,840
the
 

1249
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,830
the
monostable circuit i think so this has

1250
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
monostable circuit i think so this has
 

1251
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,909
monostable circuit i think so this has
to

1252
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
to
 

1253
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,270
to
come up somehow uh let's do it over

1254
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
come up somehow uh let's do it over
 

1255
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,390
come up somehow uh let's do it over
here yeah right here

1256
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
here yeah right here
 

1257
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,510
here yeah right here
sure okay that should work out so we run

1258
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
sure okay that should work out so we run
 

1259
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,870
sure okay that should work out so we run
the redstone up to the

1260
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
the redstone up to the
 

1261
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,149
the redstone up to the
the piston and hopefully i got this

1262
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
the piston and hopefully i got this
 

1263
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,909
the piston and hopefully i got this
right i'm not sure if i did

1264
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
right i'm not sure if i did
 

1265
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,430
right i'm not sure if i did
we'll test it out so how does it work

1266
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
we'll test it out so how does it work
 

1267
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,470
we'll test it out so how does it work
again i think

1268
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
again i think
 

1269
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,990
again i think
i might have got the sides wrong here

1270
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
i might have got the sides wrong here
 

1271
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,350
i might have got the sides wrong here
too oops put that there so if we

1272
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
too oops put that there so if we
 

1273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,870
too oops put that there so if we
press the button works perfect

1274
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
press the button works perfect
 

1275
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,830
press the button works perfect
uh what did i do wrong here okay simple

1276
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
uh what did i do wrong here okay simple
 

1277
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,789
uh what did i do wrong here okay simple
thing easy thing

1278
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
thing easy thing
 

1279
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,390
thing easy thing
these repeaters were just facing the

1280
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
these repeaters were just facing the
 

1281
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,350
these repeaters were just facing the
wrong way i put them down reversed

1282
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
wrong way i put them down reversed
 

1283
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,909
wrong way i put them down reversed
whoops that's how you don't do redstone

1284
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
whoops that's how you don't do redstone
 

1285
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,350
whoops that's how you don't do redstone
in videos guys

1286
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
in videos guys
 

1287
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,350
in videos guys
uh-huh okay so yeah on this side we put

1288
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
uh-huh okay so yeah on this side we put
 

1289
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,990
uh-huh okay so yeah on this side we put
the white

1290
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
the white
 

1291
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,310
the white
and the orange this side the orange and

1292
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
and the orange this side the orange and
 

1293
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,029
and the orange this side the orange and
the whites

1294
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
the whites
 

1295
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,110
the whites
alright so this is not actually creating

1296
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
alright so this is not actually creating
 

1297
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,430
alright so this is not actually creating
blocks it is changing blocks

1298
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
blocks it is changing blocks
 

1299
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,950
blocks it is changing blocks
so white sand becomes orange sand

1300
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
so white sand becomes orange sand
 

1301
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,710
so white sand becomes orange sand
like so then when it hits this button

1302
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
like so then when it hits this button
 

1303
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,190
like so then when it hits this button
here it breaks it

1304
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
here it breaks it
 

1305
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,510
here it breaks it
so i might set up a big machine to do

1306
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
so i might set up a big machine to do
 

1307
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,710
so i might set up a big machine to do
this for us

1308
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
this for us
 

1309
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,070
this for us
that way we can actually build with

1310
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
that way we can actually build with
 

1311
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,630
that way we can actually build with
orange sand and orange sandstone and not

1312
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
orange sand and orange sandstone and not
 

1313
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,950
orange sand and orange sandstone and not
feel bad about it

1314
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
feel bad about it
 

1315
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,630
feel bad about it
anyways i think we're gonna wrap up here

1316
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
anyways i think we're gonna wrap up here
 

1317
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,549
anyways i think we're gonna wrap up here
for today guys so here is the comment i

1318
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
for today guys so here is the comment i
 

1319
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,430
for today guys so here is the comment i
picked out it's a

1320
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
picked out it's a
 

1321
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,350
picked out it's a
it's a pretty interesting one actually

1322
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
it's a pretty interesting one actually
 

1323
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,950
it's a pretty interesting one actually
it says etho

1324
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
it says etho
 

1325
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,029
it says etho
would you ever consider remaking the

1326
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
would you ever consider remaking the
 

1327
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,549
would you ever consider remaking the
base from your old world

1328
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559

central storage room

1362
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
central storage room
 

1363
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,830
central storage room
and a whole bunch of high-tech functions

1364
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
and a whole bunch of high-tech functions
 

1365
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,029
and a whole bunch of high-tech functions
uh built into the base

1366
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
uh built into the base
 

1367
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,190
uh built into the base
that's possibly what we're gonna do in

1368
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
that's possibly what we're gonna do in
 

1369
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,470
that's possibly what we're gonna do in

uh if we do it i want the pixel here to

1374
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
uh if we do it i want the pixel here to
 

1375
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:13,990
uh if we do it i want the pixel here to
be the center

1376
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
be the center
 

1377
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,149

system and a good storage room
 

1385
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,630
system and a good storage room
this is like going to be the ultimate

1386
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
this is like going to be the ultimate
 

1387

this is like going to be the ultimate
storage room if i can figure it out

1388
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
storage room if i can figure it out
 

1389
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,070
storage room if i can figure it out
and just been figuring out a few other

1390
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
and just been figuring out a few other
 

1391
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,830
and just been figuring out a few other
high-tech things that we could do

1392
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
high-tech things that we could do
 

1393
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,070
high-tech things that we could do
i'll show you one of them next episode

but if uh if we do build an ultimate

1398
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
but if uh if we do build an ultimate
 

1399
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,470
but if uh if we do build an ultimate
base it's one of the things we're going

1400
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
base it's one of the things we're going
 

1401
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,149
base it's one of the things we're going
to include into it

1402
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
to include into it
 

1403
