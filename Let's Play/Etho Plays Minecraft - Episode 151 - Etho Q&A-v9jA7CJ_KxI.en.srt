on the Enderman farm some more it seems

38
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:11,460
on the Enderman farm some more it seems
 

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,140
on the Enderman farm some more it seems
to be one of the big things people want

40
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,150
to be one of the big things people want
 

41
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,810

so I think that's what we'll do to start

42
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:17,820
so I think that's what we'll do to start
 

43
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,140
so I think that's what we'll do to start
out at least you're going to start work

44
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,150
out at least you're going to start work
 

45
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,390
out at least you're going to start work
on the third ring today don't know if I

46
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
on the third ring today don't know if I
 

47
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,910
on the third ring today don't know if I
can finish it

48
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:24,920
can finish it
 

49
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,260
can finish it
because it will be very very costly and

50
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,270
because it will be very very costly and
 

51
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,370
because it will be very very costly and
I don't have I don't know if I have

52
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380
I don't have I don't know if I have
 

53

I don't have I don't know if I have
enough materials to do it and it's also

54
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
enough materials to do it and it's also
 

55
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,990
enough materials to do it and it's also
going to take a long time because just

56
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
going to take a long time because just
 

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,569
going to take a long time because just
the second ring alone took me an hour to

58
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
the second ring alone took me an hour to
 

59
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,740
the second ring alone took me an hour to
when I did it a few days ago or weeks or

60
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:42,750
when I did it a few days ago or weeks or
 

61
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,950
when I did it a few days ago or weeks or
however long ago it was

62
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960

 

63
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,240

but anyway I'm going to get my stuff

64
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,250
but anyway I'm going to get my stuff
 

65
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,410
but anyway I'm going to get my stuff
together and we're going to head out

66
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,420
together and we're going to head out
 

67
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:58,230

there yeah ah love click this and I'm

68
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
there yeah ah love click this and I'm
 

69
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,969
there yeah ah love click this and I'm
not sure which way I like more this way

70
00:01:59,969 --> 00:01:59,979
not sure which way I like more this way
 

71
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,910

or with TNT TNT is slightly more fun I

72
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
or with TNT TNT is slightly more fun I
 

73
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,460
or with TNT TNT is slightly more fun I
think and quicker but it's a lot

74
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,470
think and quicker but it's a lot
 

75
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,359
think and quicker but it's a lot
sloppier and you lose out the get nearly

76
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:09,369
sloppier and you lose out the get nearly
 

77
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,130
sloppier and you lose out the get nearly
as much Sam stone using TNT so I think

78
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,140
as much Sam stone using TNT so I think
 

79
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,830
as much Sam stone using TNT so I think
I'm going to stick to this method and

80
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm going to stick to this method and
 

81
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm going to stick to this method and
guess what I finally figured out how

82
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,250
guess what I finally figured out how
 

83
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,410
guess what I finally figured out how
these jukeboxes actually work and

84
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,420
these jukeboxes actually work and
 

85
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,979
these jukeboxes actually work and
something confusing me for a long time

86
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:24,989
something confusing me for a long time
 

87
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,990
something confusing me for a long time
so normally I keep my music volume down

88
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
so normally I keep my music volume down
 

89
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,479
so normally I keep my music volume down
so you wouldn't think jukeboxes would

90
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:30,489
so you wouldn't think jukeboxes would
 

91
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,690
so you wouldn't think jukeboxes would
play music right well they do they're

92
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:36,700
play music right well they do they're
 

93
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,610
play music right well they do they're
actually linked with your sound volume

94
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:38,620
actually linked with your sound volume
 

95
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,800
actually linked with your sound volume
apparently but if you adjust your volume

96
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:43,810
apparently but if you adjust your volume
 

97
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,720
apparently but if you adjust your volume
after you start it it doesn't affect the

98
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,730
after you start it it doesn't affect the
 

99
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,580
after you start it it doesn't affect the
volume of the record now it's way louder

100
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:53,590
volume of the record now it's way louder
 

101
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,970
volume of the record now it's way louder
now that I turned it up turn my sound

102
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:56,980
now that I turned it up turn my sound
 

103
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,650

all the way down still plays now if I

104
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:01,660
all the way down still plays now if I
 

105
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,620
all the way down still plays now if I
restart it

106
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,630

 

107
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,520

apparently it's still plating for some

108
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,530
apparently it's still plating for some
 

109
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:18,760
apparently it's still plating for some
reason okay um I got a few more things

110
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:18,770
reason okay um I got a few more things
 

111
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,470
reason okay um I got a few more things
to figure out about these apparently I

112
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
to figure out about these apparently I
 

113
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,420
to figure out about these apparently I
don't know why oh I bet you it messes up

114
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,430
don't know why oh I bet you it messes up
 

115
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,410

175
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,870
question answer type thing here because
I get a lot of questions asked

176
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
I get a lot of questions asked
 

177

00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,059
them in the comments but my reply gets
drownded out pretty quick so I'm

182
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:34,069
drownded out pretty quick so I'm
 

183
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,189
drownded out pretty quick so I'm
guessing very few people actually see it

184
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,199
guessing very few people actually see it
 

185
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,610
guessing very few people actually see it

that's the number one question it seems
on people's minds

194
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,190

to see it either it would ruin the
 

205
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,420

camera actually that I could use to show
 

211
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,290
camera actually that I could use to show
it so I don't really see any reason to

212
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,300
it so I don't really see any reason to
 

213
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,710
it so I don't really see any reason to
at the moment if there was a reason like

wouldn't have anything against that of
course I'm not trying to hide anything

course I'm not trying to hide anything
 

221
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,670
course I'm not trying to hide anything
but at the moment there's no good reason

222
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
but at the moment there's no good reason
 

223
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,950
but at the moment there's no good reason
for me to or no real way for me to so

226
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,370
you probably won't see my face for a
 

227

you probably won't see my face for a
while or a long time or ever at add the

229
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:48,159
while or a long time or ever at add the
way things are going now so that's that

230
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,169
way things are going now so that's that
 

231
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,330
way things are going now so that's that
um another question what do I use to

232
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:52,340
um another question what do I use to
 

233
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,409
um another question what do I use to
record I use fraps I record it half size

234
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:56,419
record I use fraps I record it half size
 

235
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,749
record I use fraps I record it half size
and then I reduce the size to 854 by 480

236
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
and then I reduce the size to 854 by 480
 

237
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,570
and then I reduce the size to 854 by 480
before I upload it to YouTube and I

238
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:04,580
before I upload it to YouTube and I
 

239
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,350
before I upload it to YouTube and I
compress it with the exid not

240
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,360
compress it with the exid not
 

241
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,600
compress it with the exid not
necessarily the best thing or the best

242
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,610
necessarily the best thing or the best
 

243
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,420
necessarily the best thing or the best
way of doing it which brings me to

244
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,430
way of doing it which brings me to
 

245
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,029
way of doing it which brings me to
another question why don't I upload in

246
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:16,039
another question why don't I upload in
 

247
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,089
another question why don't I upload in
hd-quality 720 or higher it's because I

248
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:22,099
hd-quality 720 or higher it's because I
 

249
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,529
hd-quality 720 or higher it's because I
have slow internet so it would just take

250
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:26,539
have slow internet so it would just take
 

251
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,540
have slow internet so it would just take
too long I've tried it in the past and

252
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:28,550
too long I've tried it in the past and
 

253
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,090
too long I've tried it in the past and
it usually takes me about 15 to 60

254
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,100
it usually takes me about 15 to 60
 

255
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,350
it usually takes me about 15 to 60

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,909
pig here oops
okay I guess we're not going to try that

794
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:52,919
okay I guess we're not going to try that
 

795
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,100
okay I guess we're not going to try that
that's going to going to ride them and

796
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,110
that's going to going to ride them and
 

797
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,250
that's going to going to ride them and
then throw one but oh well I guess I

798
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,260
then throw one but oh well I guess I
 

799
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,990
then throw one but oh well I guess I
could try with a boat or something or my

800
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,000
could try with a boat or something or my
 

801
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,190
could try with a boat or something or my
cart would probably do the same thing

802
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200

 

803
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,810

yeah okay so you take damage but you

804
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:17,820
yeah okay so you take damage but you
 

805
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,810
yeah okay so you take damage but you
don't actually move very weird

806
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:25,820

 

807
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,090

I'm not really sure what happens if you

808
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm not really sure what happens if you
 

809
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,130
I'm not really sure what happens if you
throw more than one pearl at a time so

810
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,140
throw more than one pearl at a time so
 

811
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,750
throw more than one pearl at a time so
let's try that we're going to throw one

812
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
let's try that we're going to throw one
 

813
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,540
let's try that we're going to throw one
way up first up I then we're going to

814
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:34,550
way up first up I then we're going to
 

815
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,120
way up first up I then we're going to
throw a second one that'll land first

816
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,130
throw a second one that'll land first
 

817
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,340
throw a second one that'll land first
and see if we teleport twice or which

818
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,350
and see if we teleport twice or which
 

819
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,290
and see if we teleport twice or which
one

820
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,300
one
 

821
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,140
one
teleports us okay we do teleport toys

822
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,150
teleports us okay we do teleport toys
 

823
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,620
teleports us okay we do teleport toys
that's that's interesting

824
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:55,630

 

825
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,940

now I'm wondering if there's like a

826
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:57,950
now I'm wondering if there's like a
 

827
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,070
now I'm wondering if there's like a
certain delay that needs to pass before

828
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
certain delay that needs to pass before
 

829
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,400
certain delay that needs to pass before
you can teleport the second time so I'm

830
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,410
you can teleport the second time so I'm
 

831
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,180
you can teleport the second time so I'm
going to throw three in a row really

832
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,190
going to throw three in a row really
 

833
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,610
going to throw three in a row really
quick together now there's no delay by

834
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:12,620
quick together now there's no delay by
 

835
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,080
quick together now there's no delay by
the looks of it I got teleport three

836
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,090
the looks of it I got teleport three
 

837
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,700
the looks of it I got teleport three
times and I I only lost five hearts

838
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:18,710
times and I I only lost five hearts
 

839
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,030
times and I I only lost five hearts
instead of seven-and-a-half all right if

840
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,040
instead of seven-and-a-half all right if
 

841
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,710
instead of seven-and-a-half all right if
I throw two really quick it should take

842
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
I throw two really quick it should take
 

843
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,930
I throw two really quick it should take
five hearts but it only took what was

844
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:31,940
five hearts but it only took what was
 

845
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,650
five hearts but it only took what was
that two and a half hmm

846
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:34,660
that two and a half hmm
 

847
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,020
that two and a half hmm
so if you do a few spam I'm really quick

848
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,030
so if you do a few spam I'm really quick
 

849
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,760
so if you do a few spam I'm really quick
you won't take damage the second time

850
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:39,770
you won't take damage the second time
 

851
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,550
you won't take damage the second time
because you're still you're hurt delay

852
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:42,560
because you're still you're hurt delay
 

853
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,630
because you're still you're hurt delay
is still occurring so it doesn't damage

854
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
is still occurring so it doesn't damage
 

855
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,730
is still occurring so it doesn't damage
you the second time next I want to try

856
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:51,740
you the second time next I want to try
 

857
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,310
you the second time next I want to try
see if you can teleport to the top of a

858
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
see if you can teleport to the top of a
 

859
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,470
see if you can teleport to the top of a
block by throwing a pearl at the bottom

860
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
block by throwing a pearl at the bottom
 

861
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,710
block by throwing a pearl at the bottom
of a block kind of like how you can

862
00:24:59,710 --> 00:24:59,720
of a block kind of like how you can
 

863
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,940
of a block kind of like how you can
place boats on top of a block if you

864
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:02,950
place boats on top of a block if you
 

865
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:10,920
place boats on top of a block if you
click on the bottom let's try this out

866
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:10,930

 

867
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,870

mmm might need a bigger platform like a

868
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:13,880
mmm might need a bigger platform like a
 

869
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,570
mmm might need a bigger platform like a
teleport to this side they're only going

870
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:19,580
teleport to this side they're only going
 

871
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:28,190
teleport to this side they're only going
to do it one thick

872
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,200

 

873
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,720

you throw on at a wall I think you just

874
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:30,730
you throw on at a wall I think you just
 

875
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,100
you throw on at a wall I think you just
fall down yeah oh I was stuck in the

876
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,110
fall down yeah oh I was stuck in the
 

877
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,299
fall down yeah oh I was stuck in the
wall there that was weird

878
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:36,309
wall there that was weird
 

879
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:44,279
wall there that was weird
I should have brought some regen potions

880
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:44,289
I should have brought some regen potions
 

881
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:50,279
I should have brought some regen potions
with me or something that time I didn't

882
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:50,289
with me or something that time I didn't
 

883
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:56,509
with me or something that time I didn't
stick mhm okay I'm going to try this

884
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:56,519
stick mhm okay I'm going to try this
 

885
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,440
stick mhm okay I'm going to try this
hopefully I don't die here now okay I

886
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,450
hopefully I don't die here now okay I
 

887
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,149
hopefully I don't die here now okay I
didn't tell them then teleport me

888
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:03,159
didn't tell them then teleport me
 

889
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,399
didn't tell them then teleport me
through the block it's getting dark here

890
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:08,409
through the block it's getting dark here
 

891
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:11,999
through the block it's getting dark here
so I'm going to try throw one and sleep

892
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:12,009
so I'm going to try throw one and sleep
 

893
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:21,570
so I'm going to try throw one and sleep
as it's in the air nope interrupted my

894
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:21,580
as it's in the air nope interrupted my
 

895
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,930
as it's in the air nope interrupted my
sleep although I'm right by the bed so

896
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:24,940
sleep although I'm right by the bed so
 

897
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,960
sleep although I'm right by the bed so
it just woke me up then teleport me okay

898
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,970
it just woke me up then teleport me okay
 

899
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,810
it just woke me up then teleport me okay
I made it 30 blocks I now we're going to

900
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:33,820
I made it 30 blocks I now we're going to
 

901
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,789
I made it 30 blocks I now we're going to
try it again but first I wanted to do

902
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:35,799
try it again but first I wanted to do
 

903
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,769
try it again but first I wanted to do
another thing to see if you can throw it

904
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:37,779
another thing to see if you can throw it
 

905
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,330
another thing to see if you can throw it
downward faster then you fall or roughly

906
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:42,340
downward faster then you fall or roughly
 

907
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,779
downward faster then you fall or roughly
to save yourself you know so you can

908
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:48,789
to save yourself you know so you can
 

909
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:53,460
to save yourself you know so you can
cool all right this is where I die

910
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:53,470
cool all right this is where I die
 

911
00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:01,810
cool all right this is where I die
maybe ah maybe not

912
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:01,820

 

913
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,230

it goes over 30 blocks high that's crazy

914
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,240

 

915
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:25,630

um it looked like maybe 33 34 yeah yeah

916
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:25,640
um it looked like maybe 33 34 yeah yeah
 

917
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,410
um it looked like maybe 33 34 yeah yeah
I would say about 33 34 is the height

918
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:31,420

 

919
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,110

let's do the falling one again here I

920
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
let's do the falling one again here I
 

921
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,330
let's do the falling one again here I
think it might be a different story if

922
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:37,340
think it might be a different story if
 

923
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,140
think it might be a different story if
we wait for our velocity to increase

924
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,150
we wait for our velocity to increase
 

925
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,210
we wait for our velocity to increase
before we throw it so maybe like halfway

926
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,220
before we throw it so maybe like halfway
 

927
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,310
before we throw it so maybe like halfway
down the fall I also extended this to 35

928
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
down the fall I also extended this to 35
 

929
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,640
down the fall I also extended this to 35
blocks so we can do the height one again

930
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,650
blocks so we can do the height one again
 

931
00:27:50,650 --> 00:28:00,070
blocks so we can do the height one again
after we get down so here we go okay so

932
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
after we get down so here we go okay so
 

933
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,010
after we get down so here we go okay so
i teleported onto myself which helped

934
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,020
i teleported onto myself which helped
 

935
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,860
i teleported onto myself which helped
break the fall that was really weird

936
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:07,870
break the fall that was really weird
 

937
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,200
break the fall that was really weird
okay let's do the height one again so

938
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,210
okay let's do the height one again so
 

939
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:18,700
okay let's do the height one again so
this is 35 blocks oh great now nope it

940
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:18,710
this is 35 blocks oh great now nope it
 

941
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,130
this is 35 blocks oh great now nope it
was going to happen that's why I set my

942
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,140
was going to happen that's why I set my
 

943
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,200
was going to happen that's why I set my
spawn here so I rewatched the video from

944
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,210
spawn here so I rewatched the video from
 

945
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,530
spawn here so I rewatched the video from
that falling one the last one where i

946
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:28,540
that falling one the last one where i
 

947
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,320
that falling one the last one where i
teleported onto myself at it looks like

948
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,330
teleported onto myself at it looks like
 

949
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,210
teleported onto myself at it looks like
I felt quite a ways after that but

950
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:34,220
I felt quite a ways after that but
 

951
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,480
I felt quite a ways after that but
didn't take damage because I was still

952
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,490
didn't take damage because I was still
 

953
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,580
didn't take damage because I was still
under the delay from the enderpearl

954
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:39,590
under the delay from the enderpearl
 

955
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,200
under the delay from the enderpearl
damage so I didn't take any additional

956
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,210
damage so I didn't take any additional
 

957
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,920
damage so I didn't take any additional
fall damage which is interesting the

958
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:47,930
fall damage which is interesting the
 

959
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,710
fall damage which is interesting the
height one I didn't get a good look so

960
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
height one I didn't get a good look so
 

961
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,780
height one I didn't get a good look so
we're going to have to do it again it

962
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:52,790
we're going to have to do it again it
 

963
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,420
we're going to have to do it again it
did look like 33 or 34 though yeah I

964
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,430
did look like 33 or 34 though yeah I
 

965
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:07,110
did look like 33 or 34 though yeah I
would say 34 maybe it's a max height

966
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120

 

967
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,340

it's really hard to tell without a

968
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,350
it's really hard to tell without a
 

969
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,770
it's really hard to tell without a
second person here okay I'm going to do

970
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:14,780
second person here okay I'm going to do
 

971
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,150
second person here okay I'm going to do
the falling one again because that was

972
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,160
the falling one again because that was
 

973
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,760
the falling one again because that was
fun yeah so throwing the Pearl halfway

974
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:21,770
fun yeah so throwing the Pearl halfway
 

975
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,500
fun yeah so throwing the Pearl halfway
through the fall definitely had a

976
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:23,510
through the fall definitely had a
 

977
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,210
through the fall definitely had a
different result than throwing it at the

978
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,220
different result than throwing it at the
 

979
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,140
different result than throwing it at the
start let's try near the ground as close

980
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,150
start let's try near the ground as close
 

981
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:34,980
start let's try near the ground as close
as we can see if the same thing happens

982
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:34,990

 

983
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,520

and yeah so if you're going to throw a

984
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,530
and yeah so if you're going to throw a
 

985
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,870
and yeah so if you're going to throw a
pearl make sure you do it right away

986
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
pearl make sure you do it right away
 

987
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,570
pearl make sure you do it right away
give you your best chances of survival

988
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:48,580

 

989
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,090

we're going to do one last test here I'm

990
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,100
we're going to do one last test here I'm
 

991
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
we're going to do one last test here I'm
curious to see if this works or not I

992
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,110
curious to see if this works or not I
 

993
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,040
curious to see if this works or not I
saw someone do it in a video apparently

994
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,050
saw someone do it in a video apparently
 

995
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,640
saw someone do it in a video apparently
if you throw an ender pearl before you

996
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:00,650
if you throw an ender pearl before you
 

997
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:11,170
if you throw an ender pearl before you
enter a portal it will still be

998
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:11,180
enter a portal it will still be
 

999
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,920
enter a portal it will still be
traveling

1000
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:14,930

 

1001
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,750

and you can apparently walk aways away

1002
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
and you can apparently walk aways away
 

1003
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,560
and you can apparently walk aways away
make a new portal enter the world again

1004
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:23,570
make a new portal enter the world again
 

1005
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,680
make a new portal enter the world again
and you will get teleported pretty much

1006
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:26,690
and you will get teleported pretty much
 

1007
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,270
and you will get teleported pretty much
instantly when the Pearl lands but I

1008
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,280
instantly when the Pearl lands but I
 

1009
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,890
instantly when the Pearl lands but I
would think you would need the world to

1010
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:32,900
would think you would need the world to
 

1011
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,570
would think you would need the world to
be loaded for that to happen so you

1012
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:34,580
be loaded for that to happen so you
 

1013
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,380
be loaded for that to happen so you
probably can't go overly far away for

1014
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,390
probably can't go overly far away for
 

1015
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:46,110
probably can't go overly far away for
that the work I could be wrong although

1016
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,120

 

1017
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,080

it's kind of perplexing because if it if

1018
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,090
it's kind of perplexing because if it if
 

1019
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,560
it's kind of perplexing because if it if
the world does unload with the ender

1020
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:53,570
the world does unload with the ender
 

1021
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,420
the world does unload with the ender
pearl in flight

1022
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,430
pearl in flight
 

1023
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,890
pearl in flight
that means you'll instantly teleports

1024
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:58,900
that means you'll instantly teleports
 

1025
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,320
that means you'll instantly teleports
when you get near the loaded or when you

1026
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,330
when you get near the loaded or when you
 

1027
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:08,260
when you get near the loaded or when you
load the area again right I gotta try it

1028
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,270
load the area again right I gotta try it
 

1029
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,650
load the area again right I gotta try it
it just sounds like too much fun so

1030
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:11,660
it just sounds like too much fun so
 

1031
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,620
it just sounds like too much fun so
we're going to make an affordable

1032
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,630
we're going to make an affordable
 

1033
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,590
we're going to make an affordable
generate a new one in the real world and

1034
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
generate a new one in the real world and
 

1035
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,740
generate a new one in the real world and
I just I need to know what happens and

1036
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:20,750
I just I need to know what happens and
 

1037
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,930
I just I need to know what happens and
I'm guessing this would work with the n

1038
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:22,940
I'm guessing this would work with the n
 

1039
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,420
I'm guessing this would work with the n
portals - not that you really would need

1040
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:25,430
portals - not that you really would need
 

1041
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,510
portals - not that you really would need
it for anything although I don't know

1042
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:28,520
it for anything although I don't know
 

1043
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,690
it for anything although I don't know
how useful this is either because you

1044
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:31,700
how useful this is either because you
 

1045
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,110
how useful this is either because you
can set your your spot where you come

1046
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
can set your your spot where you come
 

1047
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,520
can set your your spot where you come

happen
please make any portal

1054
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:52,930

 

1055
00:31:52,930 --> 00:32:01,410

be hard to tell maybe well I did not get

1056
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:01,420
be hard to tell maybe well I did not get
 

1057
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,620
be hard to tell maybe well I did not get
teleported I am in somewhere I do not

1058
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:04,630
teleported I am in somewhere I do not
 

1059
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:12,780
teleported I am in somewhere I do not
recognize okay so I have to I found a

1060
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:12,790
recognize okay so I have to I found a
 

1061
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:19,440
recognize okay so I have to I found a
snow biome okay I'm going to make my way

1062
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,450
snow biome okay I'm going to make my way
 

1063
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,530
snow biome okay I'm going to make my way
back I will keep recording though just

1064
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:22,540
back I will keep recording though just
 

1065
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,340
back I will keep recording though just
in case set we teleport when we get

1066
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,350
in case set we teleport when we get
 

1067
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,970
in case set we teleport when we get
closer I'm curious

1068
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:28,980
closer I'm curious
 

1069
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,600
closer I'm curious
yes I guess no teleport I don't know I

1070
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,610
yes I guess no teleport I don't know I
 

1071
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,490
yes I guess no teleport I don't know I
might have done it wrong or it just

1072
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:35,500
might have done it wrong or it just
 

1073
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,230
might have done it wrong or it just
might not work I'm going to try it one

1074
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
might not work I'm going to try it one
 

1075
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,880
might not work I'm going to try it one
more time except they're just going to

1076
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:41,890
more time except they're just going to
 

1077
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:51,360
more time except they're just going to
come out of this portal

1078
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,370

 

1079
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:57,660

oh that time i teleported so it was

1080
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:57,670
oh that time i teleported so it was
 

1081
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,240
oh that time i teleported so it was
still in the air so i guess we we

1082
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,250
still in the air so i guess we we
 

1083
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,700
still in the air so i guess we we
probably don't need to try it again

1084
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:04,710

 

1085
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,990

but on that note I'm going to say

1086
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,000
but on that note I'm going to say
 

1087
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,360
but on that note I'm going to say
goodbye for today thanks for watching

1088
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,370
goodbye for today thanks for watching
 

1089
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,130
goodbye for today thanks for watching
guys and I'll see you next time
