spot already so they've added two three
 

69
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,170
spot already so they've added two three
since I built this thing that I was not

70
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,180
since I built this thing that I was not
 

71
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,460

expecting anyways it's just a dropper

72
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,470
expecting anyways it's just a dropper
 

73
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,020

I have to go a short distance upward so

76
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540
I have to go a short distance upward so
 

77
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,139
I have to go a short distance upward so
it's just like six droppers here facing

78
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:00,149
it's just like six droppers here facing
 

79
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,980
it's just like six droppers here facing
up and that's all there is to it pretty

80
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:03,990
up and that's all there is to it pretty
 

81
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,749
up and that's all there is to it pretty
much compared to the text if there's an

82
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
much compared to the text if there's an
 

83
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,520
much compared to the text if there's an
item in here if there is comparator

84
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,530
item in here if there is comparator
 

85
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,530
item in here if there is comparator
turns on repeater turns on this is like

86
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:12,540
turns on repeater turns on this is like
 

87
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,320
turns on repeater turns on this is like
a

88
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,330
a
 

89
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,620
a
delay makes a long pulse extension and

90
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:16,630
delay makes a long pulse extension and
 

91
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,920
delay makes a long pulse extension and
then repeater here grabs that goes to a

92
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:19,930
then repeater here grabs that goes to a
 

93
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,010
then repeater here grabs that goes to a
comparator clock so just signal wraps

94
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,020
comparator clock so just signal wraps
 

95
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,830
comparator clock so just signal wraps
back around and then there's an elevator

96
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:24,840
back around and then there's an elevator
 

97
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,820
back around and then there's an elevator
or out redstone wire staircase thing on

or out redstone wire staircase thing on
 

99
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,440
or out redstone wire staircase thing on
the other side here that goes to each of

100
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,450
the other side here that goes to each of
 

101
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,230
the other side here that goes to each of
the droppers just goes up here and yeah

102
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,240
the droppers just goes up here and yeah
 

103
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
the droppers just goes up here and yeah
that's kind of my go-to design I think

104
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,190
that's kind of my go-to design I think
 

105
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,330
that's kind of my go-to design I think
for any short distance item elevator I

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,449
bedrock now this pulls us the rest away
as long as it doesn't mess up on us I

162
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:13,459
as long as it doesn't mess up on us I
 

163
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,430
as long as it doesn't mess up on us I
haven't had to fail yet since the added

164
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,440
haven't had to fail yet since the added
 

165
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,360
haven't had to fail yet since the added
in expert Peters so I think we're good

166
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,370
in expert Peters so I think we're good
 

167
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,780

fix this up an elevator and then BAM

168
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:22,790
fix this up an elevator and then BAM
 

169
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,270
fix this up an elevator and then BAM
library so that is pretty cool

170
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280
library so that is pretty cool
 

171
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,090
library so that is pretty cool
should work out all right now let's head

172
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,100
should work out all right now let's head
 

173
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,320
should work out all right now let's head
back down very carefully here I've

174
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,330
back down very carefully here I've
 

175
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,029
back down very carefully here I've
almost died Oh what was that that's like

176
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,039
almost died Oh what was that that's like
 

177
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,400
almost died Oh what was that that's like
my fourth time now it always takes me

178
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,410
my fourth time now it always takes me
 

179
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,020
my fourth time now it always takes me
down to one heart so I just barely

180
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,030
down to one heart so I just barely
 

181
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,250
down to one heart so I just barely
survived every time all right yeah let's

182
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,260
survived every time all right yeah let's
 

183
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,840
survived every time all right yeah let's
check out the Redstone in case you want

184
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,850
check out the Redstone in case you want
 

185
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,370
check out the Redstone in case you want
to copy it fill up first so from this

186
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,380
to copy it fill up first so from this
 

187
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,270
to copy it fill up first so from this
pressure plate here all I did is pretty

188
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,280
pressure plate here all I did is pretty
 

189
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,860
pressure plate here all I did is pretty
simple all right there's a redstone dust

190
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:00,870
simple all right there's a redstone dust
 

191
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,510
simple all right there's a redstone dust
right below that that pressure plate

192
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
right below that that pressure plate
 

193
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,219
right below that that pressure plate
then a repeater here this is just to

194
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:04,229
then a repeater here this is just to
 

195
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,590
then a repeater here this is just to
give us a bit of delay so we have time

196
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
give us a bit of delay so we have time
 

197
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,560
give us a bit of delay so we have time
to fall into position there there's a

198
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,570
to fall into position there there's a
 

199
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,680
to fall into position there there's a
block goes to another repeater then this

200
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:12,690
block goes to another repeater then this
 

201
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,600
block goes to another repeater then this
is a sticky piston with a block above

202
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,610
is a sticky piston with a block above
 

203
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,629
is a sticky piston with a block above
that's our monolith stable circuits one

204
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
that's our monolith stable circuits one
 

205
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,600
that's our monolith stable circuits one
tick repeater there that repeater goes

206
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,610
tick repeater there that repeater goes
 

207
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,770
tick repeater there that repeater goes
to this piston first off and then it

208
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
to this piston first off and then it
 

209
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,740
to this piston first off and then it
does the zigzag thing this is the the

210
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:27,750
does the zigzag thing this is the the
 

211
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,180
does the zigzag thing this is the the
repeating pattern basically two

212
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,190
repeating pattern basically two
 

213
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,300
repeating pattern basically two
repeaters each piston and then I just

214
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,310
repeaters each piston and then I just
 

215
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,500
repeaters each piston and then I just
zig zag zig zag all the way down that's

216
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,510
zig zag zig zag all the way down that's
 

217
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,439
zig zag zig zag all the way down that's
all there is to it and it seems to work

218
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:39,449
all there is to it and it seems to work
 

219
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,779
all there is to it and it seems to work
now so that's good we're going to go

220
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:41,789
now so that's good we're going to go
 

221
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,050
now so that's good we're going to go
with that now to finish this up for the

222
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,060
with that now to finish this up for the
 

223
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,760
with that now to finish this up for the
the piston tract here I'll try to do

224
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,770
the piston tract here I'll try to do
 

225
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,589
the piston tract here I'll try to do
something simple just a poopy Brown that

226
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:48,599
something simple just a poopy Brown that
 

227
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,219
something simple just a poopy Brown that
we love ever so much probably will do it

228
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:52,229
we love ever so much probably will do it
 

229
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,040
we love ever so much probably will do it
nice and simple might need to add some

230
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,050
nice and simple might need to add some
 

231
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,120
nice and simple might need to add some
lighting in there though because

232
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,130
lighting in there though because
 

233
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,490
lighting in there though because
otherwise it will probably spawn mobs

234
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
otherwise it will probably spawn mobs
 

235
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,420
otherwise it will probably spawn mobs
and stuff so maybe above at the top

236
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,430
and stuff so maybe above at the top
 

237
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,620
and stuff so maybe above at the top
you'll add some lighting there's

238
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:03,630
you'll add some lighting there's
 

239
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,820
you'll add some lighting there's
something simple DOS I don't have to

240
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,830
something simple DOS I don't have to
 

241
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,939
something simple DOS I don't have to
spend a lot of time on this and then I

242
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:07,949
spend a lot of time on this and then I
 

243
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,300
spend a lot of time on this and then I
want it to put in a wall like maybe

244
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,310
want it to put in a wall like maybe
 

245
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,899
want it to put in a wall like maybe
right here so to cut off the rest this

246
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:14,909
right here so to cut off the rest this
 

247
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,310
right here so to cut off the rest this
tunnel so we don't have to decorate it

248
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,320
tunnel so we don't have to decorate it
 

249
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,010
tunnel so we don't have to decorate it
in the future um so I brought over some

250
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,020
in the future um so I brought over some
 

251
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,170
in the future um so I brought over some
fill that in brought over a bunch of

252
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,180
fill that in brought over a bunch of
 

253
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,610
fill that in brought over a bunch of
stuff here we'll try building a

254
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,620
stuff here we'll try building a
 

255
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,120
stuff here we'll try building a
cool-looking Waller a simple wall anyway

256
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,130
cool-looking Waller a simple wall anyway
 

257
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,020
cool-looking Waller a simple wall anyway
maybe starting here oops let's do a

258
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,030
maybe starting here oops let's do a
 

259
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,659
maybe starting here oops let's do a
little entrance thing see if we can come

260
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:38,669
little entrance thing see if we can come
 

261
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,890
little entrance thing see if we can come
up with something that looks half decent

262
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:39,900
up with something that looks half decent
 

263
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,490
up with something that looks half decent
here yeah we'll do that to start off

264
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,500
here yeah we'll do that to start off
 

265
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,340
here yeah we'll do that to start off
with and maybe let's just do like

266
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,350
with and maybe let's just do like
 

267
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,370
with and maybe let's just do like
columns all the way down then that's a

268
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:49,380
columns all the way down then that's a
 

269
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,659
columns all the way down then that's a
simple thing that might look decent

270
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:50,669
simple thing that might look decent
 

271
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:56,650
simple thing that might look decent
we'll see I'll put fences between them -

272
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:56,660

 

273
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,670

all right let's just check that out

274
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
all right let's just check that out
 

275
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,820
all right let's just check that out
right now yeah I kind of like that

276
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:01,830
right now yeah I kind of like that
 

277
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,820
right now yeah I kind of like that
that's simple let's do fences ah let's

278
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:04,830
that's simple let's do fences ah let's
 

279
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,920
that's simple let's do fences ah let's
go for spruce sir oak spruce or oak

280
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:06,930
go for spruce sir oak spruce or oak
 

281
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,550
go for spruce sir oak spruce or oak
let's do oak wood for contrast maybe and

282
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
let's do oak wood for contrast maybe and
 

283
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,290
let's do oak wood for contrast maybe and
behind that let's put oh well we need

284
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,300
behind that let's put oh well we need
 

285
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,740
behind that let's put oh well we need
contrast let's go for maybe spruce wood

286
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:20,750
contrast let's go for maybe spruce wood
 

287
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,860
contrast let's go for maybe spruce wood
see what that looks like

288
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,870
see what that looks like
 

289
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,270
see what that looks like
alright something pretty simple here

290
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,280
alright something pretty simple here
 

291
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,820
alright something pretty simple here
yeah that might be ok um let's let's put

292
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:34,830
yeah that might be ok um let's let's put
 

293
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,439
yeah that might be ok um let's let's put
a little border on the bottom maybe

294
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:36,449
a little border on the bottom maybe
 

295
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,529
a little border on the bottom maybe
would be better and then spruce wood and

296
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:41,539
would be better and then spruce wood and
 

297
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,270
would be better and then spruce wood and
then the fences oh and we're trapped

298
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
then the fences oh and we're trapped
 

299
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,339
then the fences oh and we're trapped
alright I just want to close off this

300
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:46,349
alright I just want to close off this
 

301
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,300
alright I just want to close off this
area because I don't want to decorate

302
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,310
area because I don't want to decorate
 

303
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,189
area because I don't want to decorate
back here that's that's a lot of extra

304
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
back here that's that's a lot of extra
 

305
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,330
back here that's that's a lot of extra
work when we get around to it and more

306
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,340
work when we get around to it and more
 

307
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,839
work when we get around to it and more
fences yeah it's not great but that's

308
00:07:59,839 --> 00:07:59,849
fences yeah it's not great but that's
 

309
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:04,159
fences yeah it's not great but that's
it'll be ok like this we could even try

310
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:04,169
it'll be ok like this we could even try
 

311
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,080
it'll be ok like this we could even try
to add more detail to it like we could

312
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,090
to add more detail to it like we could
 

313
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,390
to add more detail to it like we could
put we don't want just like grass here

314
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
put we don't want just like grass here
 

315
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,730
put we don't want just like grass here
we'll let's put some oak wood for

316
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:10,740
we'll let's put some oak wood for
 

317
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,980
we'll let's put some oak wood for

trim on the top here we got our entrance

328
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:30,840
trim on the top here we got our entrance
 

329
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,959
trim on the top here we got our entrance
highlighted so we know where to go it's

330
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:32,969
highlighted so we know where to go it's
 

331
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,300
highlighted so we know where to go it's
pretty pretty clear to see that and did

332
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,310
pretty pretty clear to see that and did
 

333
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,790
pretty pretty clear to see that and did
the trim on the ground here then

334
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
the trim on the ground here then
 

335
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,279
the trim on the ground here then
is really important like I was saying if

336
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,289
is really important like I was saying if

you want to make a transition from a
 

339
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,060
you want to make a transition from a
wall to the ground it's good to put like

340
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,070
wall to the ground it's good to put like
 

341
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,000
wall to the ground it's good to put like
just some kind of separation block

342
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,010
just some kind of separation block
 

343
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,680
just some kind of separation block
between them and got some skylights we

344
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:51,690
between them and got some skylights we
 

345
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,570
between them and got some skylights we
got some supports we got some leaves all

346
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,580
got some supports we got some leaves all
 

347
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,870
got some supports we got some leaves all
that good stuff and I think that's going

348
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
that good stuff and I think that's going
 

349
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,940
that good stuff and I think that's going
to do it also I never realized this

350
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:58,950
to do it also I never realized this
 

351
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,880
to do it also I never realized this
before but while while doing this I

352
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:01,890
before but while while doing this I
 

353
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,829
before but while while doing this I
connect the path block to this oak trim

354
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
connect the path block to this oak trim
 

355
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,440
connect the path block to this oak trim
the path block and oak are actually very

356
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,450
the path block and oak are actually very
 

357
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,940
the path block and oak are actually very
similar in color they go pretty good

358
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:07,950
similar in color they go pretty good
 

359
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,710
similar in color they go pretty good
together I'm going to keep that in mind

361
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,600
together I'm going to keep that in mind
in the future yeah for future builds and

in the future yeah for future builds and
 

363
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,910
in the future yeah for future builds and
yeah while building this as trying to

the projects in our world I think we
 

377
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,030
the projects in our world I think we
pretty much got everything fixed right

worked on there are a few projects I
would classify as broken still there is

would classify as broken still there is
 

387
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,460
would classify as broken still there is
the second gold farm the one that used

we got the ice rooms now so it's got a
 

449
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,630
we got the ice rooms now so it's got a
good trade-off yeah so we don't have a

450
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:13,640
good trade-off yeah so we don't have a
 

451
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,220
good trade-off yeah so we don't have a
lot of like broken projects like

452
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,230
lot of like broken projects like
 

453
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,350

gold farm doesn't work and we can't fix
it we should try to make this one a

472
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:40,910
it we should try to make this one a
 

473
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,340
it we should try to make this one a
little bit nicer because I am low on

474

little bit nicer because I am low on
 

475
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,700
little bit nicer because I am low on

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:01,970
Sun would rise in the winter

Sun would rise in the winter
and I would go to bed right when the Sun

534
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:05,809
and I would go to bed right when the Sun
 

535
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,379
and I would go to bed right when the Sun
was rising and then I wake up and the

536
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:08,389
was rising and then I wake up and the
 

537
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,679
was rising and then I wake up and the
Sun would go down in a like an hour

538
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:10,689
Sun would go down in a like an hour
 

539
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,299

1024
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:30,760
moment
 

1025
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,980

over there and just kind of like some
 

1031
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,360
over there and just kind of like some
random very very abstract build

1032
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,370
random very very abstract build
 

1033
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,880
random very very abstract build
that's the way I started it so I decided

1034
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:45,890
that's the way I started it so I decided
 

1035
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,560
that's the way I started it so I decided
just to carry on with that kind of theme

1036
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:49,570
just to carry on with that kind of theme
 

1037
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,940
just to carry on with that kind of theme
let's let's see where can we get some

1038
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:51,950
let's let's see where can we get some
 

1039
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,990
let's let's see where can we get some
altitude maybe if we go to the top here

1040
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
altitude maybe if we go to the top here
 

1041
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,880
altitude maybe if we go to the top here
fly around a little bit and get a view

1042
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:57,890
fly around a little bit and get a view
 

1043
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,500
fly around a little bit and get a view
of it from some angles that's a bad

1044
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:02,510
of it from some angles that's a bad
 

1045
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,910
of it from some angles that's a bad
angle whoa I'm falling down I tell you

1046
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:06,920
angle whoa I'm falling down I tell you
 

1047
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,110
angle whoa I'm falling down I tell you
what I'm going to go to the top of that

1048
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,120
what I'm going to go to the top of that
 

1049
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,330
what I'm going to go to the top of that
that elevator there and then we can get

1050
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,340
that elevator there and then we can get
 

1051
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,780
that elevator there and then we can get
a good view of it all right so we're

1052
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:13,790
a good view of it all right so we're
 

1053
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,700
a good view of it all right so we're
going to try fly down here and get a

1054
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:15,710
going to try fly down here and get a
 

1055
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,650
going to try fly down here and get a
view from a few different angles and

1056
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:17,660
view from a few different angles and
 

1057
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,400
view from a few different angles and
hopefully we don't sink too quickly it's

1058
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,410
hopefully we don't sink too quickly it's
 

1059
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,850
hopefully we don't sink too quickly it's
kind of hard to really look at this

1060
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:24,860
kind of hard to really look at this
 

1061
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,620
kind of hard to really look at this
thing for a long time I guess I can

1062
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:26,630
thing for a long time I guess I can
 

1063
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,300
thing for a long time I guess I can
swoop up here and it'll buy us a bit

1064
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,310
swoop up here and it'll buy us a bit
 

1065
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,150
swoop up here and it'll buy us a bit
more time I think this is what I would

1066
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,160
more time I think this is what I would
 

1067
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,720
more time I think this is what I would
call the front this angle here and we're

1068
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,730
call the front this angle here and we're
 

1069
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,060
call the front this angle here and we're
pretty much yeah we got to land okay

1070
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,070
pretty much yeah we got to land okay
