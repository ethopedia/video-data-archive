hey everybody how's it going and just by

hey everybody how's it going and just by
the cave spiders right now thinking

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,370
the cave spiders right now thinking
 

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,320
the cave spiders right now thinking
about ideas what I can do with them how

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,330
about ideas what I can do with them how
 

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,920
about ideas what I can do with them how
I want to set it up there's been a few

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:21,930
I want to set it up there's been a few
 

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,540
I want to set it up there's been a few
other designs people have shown which

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:23,550
other designs people have shown which
 

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,670
other designs people have shown which
are really good some of you have

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
are really good some of you have
 

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,089
are really good some of you have
probably seen jams crasher set up for

14
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:29,099
probably seen jams crasher set up for
 

15
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,759
probably seen jams crasher set up for
killing them that works really well it's

16
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:31,769
killing them that works really well it's
 

17
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,479
killing them that works really well it's
very accurate I still want to play

18
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:35,489
very accurate I still want to play
 

19
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,520
very accurate I still want to play
around with gravity here and maybe I'll

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:40,530
around with gravity here and maybe I'll
 

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,819
around with gravity here and maybe I'll
point something else out here too some

22
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:43,829
point something else out here too some
 

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,920
point something else out here too some
people said they had trouble setting up

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:45,930
people said they had trouble setting up
 

25
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,369
people said they had trouble setting up
a cave spider trap and you got to keep

26
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:49,379
a cave spider trap and you got to keep
 

27
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,290
a cave spider trap and you got to keep
something in mind this is really

28
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,300
something in mind this is really
 

29
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,100
something in mind this is really
important these little buggers they're

30
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,110
important these little buggers they're
 

31
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,779
important these little buggers they're
just so difficult to deal with they you

32
00:00:59,779 --> 00:00:59,789
just so difficult to deal with they you
 

33
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,520
just so difficult to deal with they you
have to be within 16 blocks to the

34
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:01,530
have to be within 16 blocks to the
 

35
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,820
have to be within 16 blocks to the
spawners for them to be active and if

36
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830
spawners for them to be active and if
 

37
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,160
spawners for them to be active and if
you're within 16 blocks of them you'll

38
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,170
you're within 16 blocks of them you'll
 

39
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,160
you're within 16 blocks of them you'll
be within range of the spiders and they

40
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,170
be within range of the spiders and they
 

41
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,460
be within range of the spiders and they
will track you so if I'm standing over

42
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,470
will track you so if I'm standing over
 

43
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,249
will track you so if I'm standing over
here they kind of go towards the hole

44
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:15,259
here they kind of go towards the hole
 

45
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:20,149
here they kind of go towards the hole
over there but if I move over here they

46
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
over there but if I move over here they
 

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,679
over there but if I move over here they
can fight the current and they'll follow

48
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:21,689
can fight the current and they'll follow
 

49
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,899
can fight the current and they'll follow
me you can see they're over here now so

50
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:23,909
me you can see they're over here now so
 

51
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,039
me you can see they're over here now so
they're not falling down the hole

52
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
they're not falling down the hole
 

53
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,310
they're not falling down the hole
anymore so you got to set up your water

54
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
anymore so you got to set up your water
 

55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,300
anymore so you got to set up your water
streams so they go in the direction that

56
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,310
streams so they go in the direction that
 

57
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,770
streams so they go in the direction that
you are kind of thing and it's there

58
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:36,780
you are kind of thing and it's there
 

59
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,749
you are kind of thing and it's there
just a real pain that's what they are a

60
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
just a real pain that's what they are a
 

61
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,810
just a real pain that's what they are a
real pain

62
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,820

 

63
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,080

yeah so I'm thinking what I want to try

64
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,090
yeah so I'm thinking what I want to try
 

65
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,900
yeah so I'm thinking what I want to try
do today just playing around with an

66
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:52,910
do today just playing around with an
 

67
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,900
do today just playing around with an
idea I want to maybe it's going to take

68
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:55,910
idea I want to maybe it's going to take
 

69
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,520
idea I want to maybe it's going to take
a while but I want to dig all the area

70
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,530
a while but I want to dig all the area
 

71
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,270
a while but I want to dig all the area
below the spawners here about 15 blocks

72
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,280
below the spawners here about 15 blocks
 

73
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,820
below the spawners here about 15 blocks
down and just have them fall as soon as

74
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:06,830
down and just have them fall as soon as
 

75
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,490
down and just have them fall as soon as
they spawn instead of them being pushed

76
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:09,500
they spawn instead of them being pushed
 

77
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,880
they spawn instead of them being pushed
to a central point and then falling just

78
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:12,890
to a central point and then falling just
 

79
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,030
to a central point and then falling just
want them to fall right off the bat and

80
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
want them to fall right off the bat and
 

81
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,650
want them to fall right off the bat and
see how that works out these things are

82
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:20,660
see how that works out these things are
 

83
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,360
see how that works out these things are
a lot simpler to set up if you just have

84
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,370
a lot simpler to set up if you just have
 

85
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,480
a lot simpler to set up if you just have
one spawner if you have to it gets a lot

86
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:25,490
one spawner if you have to it gets a lot
 

87
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,220
one spawner if you have to it gets a lot
more complicated because like I said

88
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,230
more complicated because like I said
 

89
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,180
more complicated because like I said
they're tracking you so if I'm over I'm

90
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,190
they're tracking you so if I'm over I'm
 

91
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,910
they're tracking you so if I'm over I'm
over here the spiders from that spawner

92
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
over here the spiders from that spawner
 

93
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
over here the spiders from that spawner
will probably go towards the hole but

94
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,410
will probably go towards the hole but
 

95
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,070
will probably go towards the hole but
the ones from this spawner here are

96
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,080
the ones from this spawner here are
 

97
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,580
the ones from this spawner here are
probably going to go and get stuck

98
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:41,590
probably going to go and get stuck
 

99
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:50,130
probably going to go and get stuck
following me over here so it's just yeah

100
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,140
following me over here so it's just yeah
 

101
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,600
following me over here so it's just yeah
okay well anyway I'll play around with

102
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:52,610
okay well anyway I'll play around with
 

103
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,990
okay well anyway I'll play around with
it see what happens all right just to

104
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,000
it see what happens all right just to
 

105
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,990
it see what happens all right just to
build down all the way it's taking a

106
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
build down all the way it's taking a
 

107
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,979
build down all the way it's taking a
while but almost there not sure how this

108
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:05,989
while but almost there not sure how this
 

109
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,130
while but almost there not sure how this
will work out we won't be able to

110
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,140
will work out we won't be able to
 

111
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,220
will work out we won't be able to
accurately damage the spiders like this

112
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,230
accurately damage the spiders like this
 

113
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,509
accurately damage the spiders like this
because some will fall from greater

114
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
because some will fall from greater
 

115
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,940
because some will fall from greater
heights than others but yeah we'll see

116
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:18,950
heights than others but yeah we'll see
 

117
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,710
heights than others but yeah we'll see
we'll see what happens I just want to

118
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
we'll see what happens I just want to
 

119
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,970
we'll see what happens I just want to
try it and then I'll probably put fence

120
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:24,980
try it and then I'll probably put fence
 

121
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,780
try it and then I'll probably put fence
posts with water above they'll instantly

122
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:28,790
posts with water above they'll instantly
 

123
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,220
posts with water above they'll instantly
spawn they won't be able to climb

124
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,230
spawn they won't be able to climb
 

125
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,190
spawn they won't be able to climb
anything as they're falling the land on

126
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
anything as they're falling the land on
 

127
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,300
anything as they're falling the land on
the fence posts and then they'll get

128
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,310
the fence posts and then they'll get
 

129
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,960
the fence posts and then they'll get
collected somewhere is the plant

130
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:42,970
collected somewhere is the plant
 

131
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,890
collected somewhere is the plant
he stole a mushroom new this guy

132
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:48,900
he stole a mushroom new this guy
 

133
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,449
he stole a mushroom new this guy
how did you even get down here that's

134
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:51,459
how did you even get down here that's
 

135
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:58,410
how did you even get down here that's
what I want to know it's like he's above

136
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,420
what I want to know it's like he's above
 

137
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,240
what I want to know it's like he's above
me it's like I don't know it's so bright

138
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,250
me it's like I don't know it's so bright
 

139
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,869
me it's like I don't know it's so bright
down here they must step in water and

140
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
down here they must step in water and
 

141
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,089
down here they must step in water and
teleport and then I get down my table

142
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,099
teleport and then I get down my table
 

143
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,280
teleport and then I get down my table
the time because they're always in areas

144
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,290
the time because they're always in areas
 

145
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,620
the time because they're always in areas
that are too bright for them to spawn

146
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,630

 

147
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,479

and then I hit them they teleport out

148
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:18,489
and then I hit them they teleport out
 

149
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,040
and then I hit them they teleport out
and I never see them again

150
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,050

 

151
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,770

yeah this is pretty good it's really

152
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:25,780
yeah this is pretty good it's really
 

153
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,770
yeah this is pretty good it's really
scary being down here but I will have to

154
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:31,780
scary being down here but I will have to
 

155
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,080
scary being down here but I will have to
put a block above the spawner so I lose

156
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,090
put a block above the spawner so I lose
 

157
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,930
put a block above the spawner so I lose
one space doing that because otherwise

158
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:36,940
one space doing that because otherwise
 

159
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,580
one space doing that because otherwise
they'll spawn up there and they won't

160
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:38,590
they'll spawn up there and they won't
 

161
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:46,770
they'll spawn up there and they won't
fall down as you can see when they spawn

162
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:46,780
fall down as you can see when they spawn
 

163
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,930
fall down as you can see when they spawn
either one two four will spawn by the

164
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:48,940
either one two four will spawn by the
 

165
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,710
either one two four will spawn by the
looks of it and this is 16 blocks high

166
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:55,720
looks of it and this is 16 blocks high
 

167
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,200
looks of it and this is 16 blocks high
this this room here so 14 blocks below

168
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,210
this this room here so 14 blocks below
 

169
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,230
this this room here so 14 blocks below
the spawner

170
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
the spawner
 

171
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,969
the spawner
and a lot of them are dying when they

172
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:02,979
and a lot of them are dying when they
 

173
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,740
and a lot of them are dying when they
hit the ground so I think if I put fence

174
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:04,750
hit the ground so I think if I put fence
 

175
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,610
hit the ground so I think if I put fence
posts at this level here it'll work

176
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:07,620
posts at this level here it'll work
 

177
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,920
posts at this level here it'll work
that's the right height I'm going to try

178
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:10,930
that's the right height I'm going to try
 

179
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,779
that's the right height I'm going to try
it now and we'll see what happens if

180
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:12,789
it now and we'll see what happens if
 

181
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,480
it now and we'll see what happens if
they if they stay alive that's what I

182
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,490
they if they stay alive that's what I
 

183
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:22,320
they if they stay alive that's what I
want yeah so this is a good height this

184
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,330
want yeah so this is a good height this
 

185
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,990
want yeah so this is a good height this
is a they're not dying when they land on

186
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,000
is a they're not dying when they land on
 

187
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,640
is a they're not dying when they land on
the fences so that's there was 14 air

188
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,650
the fences so that's there was 14 air
 

189
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,060
the fences so that's there was 14 air
spaces below the spawner and then I put

190
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,070
spaces below the spawner and then I put
 

191
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,990
spaces below the spawner and then I put
fences there and they're all a one-hit

192
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
fences there and they're all a one-hit
 

193
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,230
fences there and they're all a one-hit
kill with a stone sword like I wanted

194
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,240
kill with a stone sword like I wanted
 

195
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,770
kill with a stone sword like I wanted
you could set it up so that so one hit

196
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:43,780
you could set it up so that so one hit
 

197
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,990
you could set it up so that so one hit
kill with your fist if if you made sure

198
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,000
kill with your fist if if you made sure
 

199
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,029
kill with your fist if if you made sure
you drop them from the exact same height

200
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
you drop them from the exact same height
 

201
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,050
you drop them from the exact same height
every time but I I'm fine with just

202
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,060
every time but I I'm fine with just
 

203
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,500
every time but I I'm fine with just
using a stone sword here I've also

204
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,510
using a stone sword here I've also
 

205
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,320
using a stone sword here I've also
noticed since I put fences there there

206
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,330
noticed since I put fences there there
 

207
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,070
noticed since I put fences there there
have

208
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
have
 

209
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,399
have
trouble climbing their behavior has

210
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,409
trouble climbing their behavior has
 

211
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,950
trouble climbing their behavior has
changed before they were climbing up

212
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:07,960
changed before they were climbing up
 

213
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,689
changed before they were climbing up
these walls to get me and now it's like

214
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:09,699
these walls to get me and now it's like
 

215
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,059
these walls to get me and now it's like
they don't know how so that's kind of

216
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:15,069
they don't know how so that's kind of
 

217
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,510
they don't know how so that's kind of
interesting as well so I'll probably put

218
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,520
interesting as well so I'll probably put
 

219
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,959
interesting as well so I'll probably put
water on top or yeah yeah I'll use water

220
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:24,969
water on top or yeah yeah I'll use water
 

221
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,999
water on top or yeah yeah I'll use water
probably I don't really need to because

222
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:27,009
probably I don't really need to because
 

223
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,089
probably I don't really need to because
it'll just follow me if I'm down there

224
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:29,099
it'll just follow me if I'm down there
 

225
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,010
it'll just follow me if I'm down there
but I might make them come back up here

226
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,020
but I might make them come back up here
 

227
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,040
but I might make them come back up here
yet just so I don't have to go down

228
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,050
yet just so I don't have to go down
 

229
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,439
yet just so I don't have to go down
lower and see if we need that working

230
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:37,449
lower and see if we need that working
 

231
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,189
lower and see if we need that working
and the nice thing is since they drop

232
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
and the nice thing is since they drop
 

233
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,330
and the nice thing is since they drop
down there like instantly out of the way

234
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:45,340
down there like instantly out of the way
 

235
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,580
down there like instantly out of the way
so that we don't have to worry about the

236
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,590
so that we don't have to worry about the
 

237
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,939
so that we don't have to worry about the
six spider limit next to the spawner

238
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:49,949
six spider limit next to the spawner
 

239
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,369
six spider limit next to the spawner
because before the two spawners were

240
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:53,379
because before the two spawners were
 

241
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,129
because before the two spawners were
kind of interfering with each other and

242
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,139
kind of interfering with each other and
 

243
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:02,909
kind of interfering with each other and
now there's no problems okay so I'll

244
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
now there's no problems okay so I'll
 

245
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,589
now there's no problems okay so I'll
keep working at it and I'll see you

246
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:04,599
keep working at it and I'll see you
 

247
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,510
keep working at it and I'll see you
again soon I came back to get some new

248
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
again soon I came back to get some new
 

249
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,230
again soon I came back to get some new
pics got a efficiency to one which is

250
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,240
pics got a efficiency to one which is
 

251
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,159
pics got a efficiency to one which is
nice you shouldn't see ones and my

252
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:16,169
nice you shouldn't see ones and my
 

253
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,869
nice you shouldn't see ones and my
melons and pumpkins are all grown here

254
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:18,879
melons and pumpkins are all grown here
 

255
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,749
melons and pumpkins are all grown here
so I thought I'd show you guys how it

256
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
so I thought I'd show you guys how it
 

257

looks I like it very happy with this
 

259
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,439
looks I like it very happy with this
farm lost one again right there

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:34,449
farm lost one again right there
 

261
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:43,769
farm lost one again right there
it's not bad though put it back leave

262
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:43,779
it's not bad though put it back leave
 

263
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,860
it's not bad though put it back leave
and it's ready to go again

264
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:48,870

 

265
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,200

very nice

266
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,210
very nice
 

267
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,610
very nice
all right back to the spidered stuff

268
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:57,620

 

269
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,439

yeah so I'm just digging out this area

270
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,449
yeah so I'm just digging out this area
 

271
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,620
yeah so I'm just digging out this area
below the second spawner here almost at

272
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,630
below the second spawner here almost at
 

273
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,930
below the second spawner here almost at
the bottom

274
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:05,940
the bottom
 

275
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,340
the bottom
I got an efficiency to pick I think I

276
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,350
I got an efficiency to pick I think I
 

277
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,150
I got an efficiency to pick I think I
said that already

278
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,160
said that already
 

279
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,120
said that already
let's check it out it's pretty nice

280
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,130
let's check it out it's pretty nice
 

281
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,950
let's check it out it's pretty nice
quick it's not really worth putting your

282
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
quick it's not really worth putting your
 

283
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,860
quick it's not really worth putting your
levels into iron tools though I find

284
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:24,870
levels into iron tools though I find
 

285
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,010
levels into iron tools though I find
they just wear out too quickly normally

286
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,020
they just wear out too quickly normally
 

287
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,439
they just wear out too quickly normally
I just do a level one enchantment on

288
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:30,449
I just do a level one enchantment on
 

289
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,219
I just do a level one enchantment on
them but I used 15 levels to get the

290
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:34,229
them but I used 15 levels to get the
 

291
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,860
them but I used 15 levels to get the
proficiency to pick but the thing is the

292
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:39,870
proficiency to pick but the thing is the
 

293
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,260
proficiency to pick but the thing is the
better the quality of the tool to begin

294
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,270
better the quality of the tool to begin
 

295
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,510
better the quality of the tool to begin
with them better the skills we'll get on

296
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:44,520
with them better the skills we'll get on
 

297
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,800
with them better the skills we'll get on
it from my understanding so if you put

298
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:47,810
it from my understanding so if you put
 

299
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,480
it from my understanding so if you put
ten levels into a diamond pick you're

300
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,490
ten levels into a diamond pick you're
 

301
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,850
ten levels into a diamond pick you're
more likely to get better skills than if

302
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:52,860
more likely to get better skills than if
 

303
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,090
more likely to get better skills than if
you put ten levels into an iron pick

304
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,100
you put ten levels into an iron pick
 

305
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,630
you put ten levels into an iron pick
because it's a higher quality pick and I

306
00:08:59,630 --> 00:08:59,640
because it's a higher quality pick and I
 

307
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,000
because it's a higher quality pick and I
think make the gold ones are the best

308
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,010
think make the gold ones are the best
 

309
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:08,390
think make the gold ones are the best
from what I've read so yeah usually I

310
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,400
from what I've read so yeah usually I
 

311
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,460
from what I've read so yeah usually I
just put one level into my iron iron

312
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,470
just put one level into my iron iron
 

313
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,820
just put one level into my iron iron
stuff so I'll have to put fences below

314
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:16,830
stuff so I'll have to put fences below
 

315
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,710
stuff so I'll have to put fences below
this one and water stream they'll

316
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
this one and water stream they'll
 

317
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,760
this one and water stream they'll
connect finding a strange thing with

318
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,770
connect finding a strange thing with
 

319
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,340
connect finding a strange thing with
these spiders the way I have it set up

320
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,350
these spiders the way I have it set up
 

321
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,949
these spiders the way I have it set up
right now they can't get out they can't

322
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:27,959
right now they can't get out they can't
 

323
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,720
right now they can't get out they can't
climb up to me unless like once they

324
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,730
climb up to me unless like once they
 

325
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,160
climb up to me unless like once they
fall down there they can't get to me and

326
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,170
fall down there they can't get to me and
 

327
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,900
fall down there they can't get to me and
even if they try one spider will shoot

328
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:38,910
even if they try one spider will shoot
 

329
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,300
even if they try one spider will shoot
out and then they fall back down kind of

330
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,310
out and then they fall back down kind of
 

331
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:49,129
out and then they fall back down kind of
kind of interesting a little weird

332
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:49,139

 

333
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,989

eventually that one spider will find a

334
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:51,999
eventually that one spider will find a
 

335
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,350
eventually that one spider will find a
position where they won't climb so he'll

336
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
position where they won't climb so he'll
 

337
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,019
position where they won't climb so he'll
just stay down with him but until then

338
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:01,029
just stay down with him but until then
 

339
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,539
just stay down with him but until then
he just gets rejected he's not part of

340
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:03,549
he just gets rejected he's not part of
 

341
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,539
he just gets rejected he's not part of
the not part of the pack they kick him

342
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:06,549
the not part of the pack they kick him
 

343
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:11,160
the not part of the pack they kick him
out every time that looks like we have

344
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,170
out every time that looks like we have
 

345
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,269
out every time that looks like we have
to rejects now

346
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:12,279
to rejects now
 

347
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:22,859
to rejects now
oh well poor spiders okay we're making a

348
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:22,869
oh well poor spiders okay we're making a
 

349
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,289
oh well poor spiders okay we're making a
good progress here coming along nicely

350
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:25,299
good progress here coming along nicely
 

351
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,819
good progress here coming along nicely
got lots done I've finished digging out

352
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:29,829
got lots done I've finished digging out
 

353
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,160
got lots done I've finished digging out
the second one you got the fences down

354
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,170
the second one you got the fences down
 

355
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,049
the second one you got the fences down
the water streams are set up there's

356
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:37,059
the water streams are set up there's
 

357
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,650
the water streams are set up there's
another stream that brings them towards

358
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,660
another stream that brings them towards
 

359
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,629
another stream that brings them towards
this center area for both of them

360
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:44,639
this center area for both of them
 

361
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,639
this center area for both of them
there's not really any way for me to

362
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:47,649
there's not really any way for me to
 

363
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,999
there's not really any way for me to
avoid them trapping me so I'm just gonna

364
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:51,009
avoid them trapping me so I'm just gonna
 

365
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,460
avoid them trapping me so I'm just gonna
have to try to deal with it so I have

366
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,470
have to try to deal with it so I have
 

367
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,150
have to try to deal with it so I have
like a lip here so they can't climb up

368
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
like a lip here so they can't climb up
 

369
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,850
like a lip here so they can't climb up
higher than the point that will kill

370
00:10:59,850 --> 00:10:59,860
higher than the point that will kill
 

371
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,369
higher than the point that will kill
them you know like it's fine if they're

372
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:02,379
them you know like it's fine if they're
 

373
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,109
them you know like it's fine if they're
climbing like this as long as they want

374
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:04,119
climbing like this as long as they want
 

375
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:07,379
climbing like this as long as they want
to kill themselves from fall damage

376
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:07,389
to kill themselves from fall damage
 

377
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,189
to kill themselves from fall damage
that's what I need to avoid and then

378
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:11,199
that's what I need to avoid and then
 

379
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:15,239
that's what I need to avoid and then
when if I'm standing ooh oh that was

380
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:15,249
when if I'm standing ooh oh that was
 

381
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:17,850
when if I'm standing ooh oh that was
dangerous I'm sending around here

382
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:17,860
dangerous I'm sending around here
 

383
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,259
dangerous I'm sending around here
they'll they'll make it into the pack

384
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:19,269
they'll they'll make it into the pack
 

385
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,100
they'll they'll make it into the pack
here so that's okay they're all one hit

386
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,110
here so that's okay they're all one hit
 

387
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:29,309
here so that's okay they're all one hit
with a stone sword that's real nice and

388
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:29,319
with a stone sword that's real nice and
 

389
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,739
with a stone sword that's real nice and
they try to set something up so I can

390
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:31,749
they try to set something up so I can
 

391
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:38,249
they try to set something up so I can
get their items easily don't know what

392
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:38,259
get their items easily don't know what
 

393
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,079
get their items easily don't know what
I'll do about that yet for right now I

394
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,089
I'll do about that yet for right now I
 

395
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,809
I'll do about that yet for right now I
just have a ladder to go down is not

396
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:42,819
just have a ladder to go down is not
 

397
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:47,519
just have a ladder to go down is not
very good we got the nice glass lookout

398
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:47,529
very good we got the nice glass lookout
 

399
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,710
very good we got the nice glass lookout
which is cool I'll probably make it five

400
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
which is cool I'll probably make it five
 

401
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,960
which is cool I'll probably make it five
blocks high so I can see the spawner I

402
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:54,970
blocks high so I can see the spawner I
 

403
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,510
blocks high so I can see the spawner I
can just barely see it right now it's

404
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,520
can just barely see it right now it's
 

405
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,230
can just barely see it right now it's
over there and then I'll probably have a

406
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,240
over there and then I'll probably have a
 

407
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,720
over there and then I'll probably have a
lookout up top here too something over

408
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:06,730
lookout up top here too something over
 

409
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,140
lookout up top here too something over
here so that we can see both spawners

410
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,150
here so that we can see both spawners
 

411
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:17,130
here so that we can see both spawners
from above here and I did notice I had

412
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,140
from above here and I did notice I had
 

413
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,560
from above here and I did notice I had
my feelings about this before but I had

414
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:19,570
my feelings about this before but I had
 

415
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,580
my feelings about this before but I had
some torches around the spawner here the

416
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,590
some torches around the spawner here the
 

417
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,730
some torches around the spawner here the
lighting level was below seven but it

418
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:26,740
lighting level was below seven but it
 

419
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,290
lighting level was below seven but it
was close to seven in areas or below

420
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:31,300
was close to seven in areas or below
 

421
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,460
was close to seven in areas or below
eight I mean and lighting does seem to

422
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,470
eight I mean and lighting does seem to
 

423
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,190
eight I mean and lighting does seem to
affect the rate of spawning from what I

424
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,200
affect the rate of spawning from what I
 

425
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,430
affect the rate of spawning from what I
saw I'm 90% sure at least even though

426
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
saw I'm 90% sure at least even though
 

427
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,250
saw I'm 90% sure at least even though
the lighting was below 8 it was kind of

428
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,260
the lighting was below 8 it was kind of
 

429
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,260
the lighting was below 8 it was kind of
slow and then when I removed some of the

430
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,270
slow and then when I removed some of the
 

431
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,410
slow and then when I removed some of the
distant torches lighting went way down

432
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,420
distant torches lighting went way down
 

433
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,160
distant torches lighting went way down
and spawn rates went way up so maybe

434
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,170
and spawn rates went way up so maybe
 

435
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,430
and spawn rates went way up so maybe
sure lighting effects spawners now or

436
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
sure lighting effects spawners now or
 

437
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,860
sure lighting effects spawners now or
not now but now I'm now I'm pretty sure

438
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:03,870
not now but now I'm now I'm pretty sure
 

439
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,120
not now but now I'm now I'm pretty sure
that is my opinion

440
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,130
that is my opinion
 

441
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,140
that is my opinion
as of now that's how I'll word it yeah

442
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,150
as of now that's how I'll word it yeah
 

443
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,820
as of now that's how I'll word it yeah
ok um you know I have like the shortest

444
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,830
ok um you know I have like the shortest
 

445
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,020
ok um you know I have like the shortest
attention span of anybody I'm I feel

446
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,030
attention span of anybody I'm I feel
 

447
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,790
attention span of anybody I'm I feel
like starting a new project right now

448
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
like starting a new project right now
 

449
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,730

spotter for them too sometime that's the

490
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:41,830
spotter for them too sometime that's the
 

491
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,680
spotter for them too sometime that's the
most difficult one to deal with anyway

492
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:46,690
most difficult one to deal with anyway
 

493
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,590
most difficult one to deal with anyway
I'll see you again after a little bit

494
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
I'll see you again after a little bit
 

495
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,330
I'll see you again after a little bit
here and this is what it looks like

496
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,340
here and this is what it looks like
 

497
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,950
here and this is what it looks like
inside the spawning area I'm still

498
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:58,960
inside the spawning area I'm still
 

499
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,250
inside the spawning area I'm still
adjusting it a little bit I found I need

500
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,260
adjusting it a little bit I found I need
 

501
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,490
adjusting it a little bit I found I need
a two-block high clearance here because

502
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:05,500
a two-block high clearance here because
 

503
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,070
a two-block high clearance here because
when I had only one block the spiders

504
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,080
when I had only one block the spiders
 

505
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,810
when I had only one block the spiders
most the time would climb up the glass

506
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:12,820
most the time would climb up the glass
 

507
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,120
most the time would climb up the glass
and then they would fall down and die so

508
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,130
and then they would fall down and die so
 

509
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,170
and then they would fall down and die so
I got two blocks now I also raised our

510
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,180
I got two blocks now I also raised our
 

511
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:28,770
I got two blocks now I also raised our
iron bar thing up one so that means yeah

512
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:28,780
iron bar thing up one so that means yeah
 

513
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,740
iron bar thing up one so that means yeah
so this is up higher that's a four-block

514
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:31,750
so this is up higher that's a four-block
 

515
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,690
so this is up higher that's a four-block
drop I might have to put a half slab

516
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:33,700
drop I might have to put a half slab
 

517
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,480
drop I might have to put a half slab
below because if they fall down I think

518
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,490
below because if they fall down I think
 

519
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,980
below because if they fall down I think
they'll take damage now going up one

520
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:40,990
they'll take damage now going up one
 

521
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,780
they'll take damage now going up one
block though brings me closer to the

522
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:42,790
block though brings me closer to the
 

523
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,120
block though brings me closer to the
spawner x' as well so that'll be

524
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,130
spawner x' as well so that'll be
 

525
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,450
spawner x' as well so that'll be
beneficial I thought a really strange

526
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:51,460
beneficial I thought a really strange
 

527
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,060
beneficial I thought a really strange

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,070
glitch that I didn't know about while
 

529
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,670
glitch that I didn't know about while
building this and it's really really

530
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,680
building this and it's really really
 

531
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,670
building this and it's really really
annoying me actually if you have a fence

532
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
annoying me actually if you have a fence
 

533
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,640
annoying me actually if you have a fence
or a water stream pushing you on top of

or a water stream pushing you on top of

549
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,070

lots of work involved I think I'm going

lots of work involved I think I'm going
 

551
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,180
lots of work involved I think I'm going
to start putting our stone bricks around

though before I open this up otherwise

636
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:27,670
though before I open this up otherwise
 

637
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,640
though before I open this up otherwise
I'm going to

638
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:28,650
I'm going to
 

639
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,370
I'm going to
heat myself later would like to do more

640
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,380
heat myself later would like to do more
 

641
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,470
heat myself later would like to do more

enchantment room maybe a potion room
stuff like that down here in this area

648
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:46,429
stuff like that down here in this area
 

649
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:51,380
stuff like that down here in this area
this is a nice area so this takes a long

650
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,390
this is a nice area so this takes a long
 

651
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,539
this is a nice area so this takes a long
time I love it there's another sword

652
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:56,549
time I love it there's another sword
 

653
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,060
time I love it there's another sword
oh we've reached the end so right now I

654
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,070
oh we've reached the end so right now I
 

655
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,980
oh we've reached the end so right now I
just have to like I'm just doing this

656
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:03,990
just have to like I'm just doing this
 

657
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:11,720
just have to like I'm just doing this
one more down yet there we go okay but

658
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:11,730
one more down yet there we go okay but
 

659
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,320
one more down yet there we go okay but
yeah that's it I think I'm going to be

660
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,330
yeah that's it I think I'm going to be
 

661
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,730
yeah that's it I think I'm going to be
done working on this today well let's

662
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:16,740
done working on this today well let's
 

663
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,740
done working on this today well let's
try to the iron bar thing see how this

664
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:18,750
try to the iron bar thing see how this
 

665
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,970
try to the iron bar thing see how this
goes you light down here so the water

666
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:22,980
goes you light down here so the water
 

667
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:33,200
goes you light down here so the water
stream should be over here yeah Galit I

668
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,210
stream should be over here yeah Galit I
 

669
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,610
stream should be over here yeah Galit I
should show you the rate set they're

670
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:34,620
should show you the rate set they're
 

671
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,830
should show you the rate set they're
spawning to put iron an iron bar there

672
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
spawning to put iron an iron bar there
 

673
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,810
spawning to put iron an iron bar there
and one here

674
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:41,820
and one here
 

675
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,510
and one here
Oh like oh they can fit through that

676
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
Oh like oh they can fit through that
 

677
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:57,230
Oh like oh they can fit through that
still unless I put one hand but then

678
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,240
still unless I put one hand but then
 

679
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,269
still unless I put one hand but then
they won't climb hmm

680
00:20:59,269 --> 00:20:59,279
they won't climb hmm
 

681
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,310
they won't climb hmm
didn't think this through how whatever

682
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
didn't think this through how whatever
 

683
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,820
didn't think this through how whatever
I'll figure out some other time but yeah

684
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:07,830
I'll figure out some other time but yeah
 

685
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,389
I'll figure out some other time but yeah
about 1 2 4 will spawn each time the

686
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:11,399
about 1 2 4 will spawn each time the
 

687
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,950
about 1 2 4 will spawn each time the
spawner goes so I think spawners average

688
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
spawner goes so I think spawners average
 

689
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,820
spawner goes so I think spawners average
spawning mom's every 21 seconds or so a

690
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:18,830
spawning mom's every 21 seconds or so a
 

691
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,350
spawning mom's every 21 seconds or so a
lot time they'll climb around if I'm not

692
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
lot time they'll climb around if I'm not
 

693
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,650
lot time they'll climb around if I'm not
in a good position down here but

694
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:25,660
in a good position down here but
 

695
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,110
in a good position down here but
and if they're backed up sometimes

696
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,120
and if they're backed up sometimes
 

697
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,460
and if they're backed up sometimes
they'll get on the glass and start

698
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,470
they'll get on the glass and start
 

699
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:36,450
they'll get on the glass and start
climbing not a big deal yeah so one two

700
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,460
climbing not a big deal yeah so one two
 

701
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,100
climbing not a big deal yeah so one two
four so we got two spawners so probably

702
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,110
four so we got two spawners so probably
 

703
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,290
four so we got two spawners so probably
four moms every 20 seconds or so 20 XP

704
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,300
four moms every 20 seconds or so 20 XP
 

705
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,860
four moms every 20 seconds or so 20 XP
yeah like one XP every second is the

706
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:49,870
yeah like one XP every second is the
 

707
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,940
yeah like one XP every second is the
rate I would say if I was to guesstimate

708
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:53,950
rate I would say if I was to guesstimate
 

709
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,180
rate I would say if I was to guesstimate
very roughly I'd say one XP per second

710
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,190
very roughly I'd say one XP per second
 

711
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:06,510
very roughly I'd say one XP per second
with my setup here nice all right and I

712
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:06,520
with my setup here nice all right and I
 

713
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,150
with my setup here nice all right and I
don't have to be the reparation have to

714
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,160
don't have to be the reparation have to
 

715
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,740
don't have to be the reparation have to
be directly over here I could probably

716
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:10,750
be directly over here I could probably
 

717
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,920
be directly over here I could probably
be moving around doing stuff in the area

718
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:13,930
be moving around doing stuff in the area
 

719
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,860
be moving around doing stuff in the area
as long as I'm 16 blocks within both

720
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:16,870
as long as I'm 16 blocks within both
 

721
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:24,630
as long as I'm 16 blocks within both
spawners it'll keep going yeah okay so

722
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
spawners it'll keep going yeah okay so
 

723
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,720
spawners it'll keep going yeah okay so
this was fun for today I'm going to

724
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:27,730
this was fun for today I'm going to
 

725
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,910
this was fun for today I'm going to
check the time maybe we'll do something

726
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:29,920
check the time maybe we'll do something
 

727
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,440
check the time maybe we'll do something
else all right so I did get the item

728
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,450
else all right so I did get the item
 

729
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,230
else all right so I did get the item
collection working here I used an iron

730
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,240
collection working here I used an iron
 

731
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,770
collection working here I used an iron
bar it worked I just had to put in a

732
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:40,780
bar it worked I just had to put in a
 

733
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,640
bar it worked I just had to put in a
different position so what's happening

734
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,650
different position so what's happening
 

735
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,860
different position so what's happening
now iron bars here the water stream is

736
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:49,870
now iron bars here the water stream is
 

737
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,430
now iron bars here the water stream is
directly above and there's enough of a

738
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
directly above and there's enough of a
 

739
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,940
directly above and there's enough of a
gap here for the items to fall down but

740
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,950
gap here for the items to fall down but
 

741
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,740
gap here for the items to fall down but
the spiders aren't able to come down

742
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:58,750
the spiders aren't able to come down
 

743
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,390
the spiders aren't able to come down
here and they're not able to hurt me

744
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
here and they're not able to hurt me
 

745
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,110
here and they're not able to hurt me
down here which is nice what I would

746
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,120
down here which is nice what I would
 

747
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,770
down here which is nice what I would
like to do is set up a piston pushing an

748
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:07,780
like to do is set up a piston pushing an
 

749
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,410
like to do is set up a piston pushing an
item pushing system to get the items up

750
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:10,420
item pushing system to get the items up
 

751
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,980
item pushing system to get the items up
here so I'll need one two three four

752
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:13,990
here so I'll need one two three four
 

753
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,390
here so I'll need one two three four
five at least five Pistons to do that ah

754
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
five at least five Pistons to do that ah
 

755
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,680
five at least five Pistons to do that ah
it won't be automatic or anything like

756
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:21,690
it won't be automatic or anything like
 

757
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,600
it won't be automatic or anything like
it won't be on a clock I mean I'll

758
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,610
it won't be on a clock I mean I'll
 

759
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,460
it won't be on a clock I mean I'll
probably have a button or a pressure

760
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,470
probably have a button or a pressure
 

761
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,680
probably have a button or a pressure
plate when I step on it the item so you

762
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:28,690
plate when I step on it the item so you
 

763
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,950
plate when I step on it the item so you
moved up here and towards me instead of

764
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:31,960
moved up here and towards me instead of
 

765
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,290
moved up here and towards me instead of
me having to go down there to pick them

766
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:34,300
me having to go down there to pick them
 

767
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:41,280
me having to go down there to pick them
up hopefully but I think we're out of

768
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,290
up hopefully but I think we're out of
 

769
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,470
up hopefully but I think we're out of
time for today it's getting late here so

770
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:43,480
time for today it's getting late here so
 

771
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,220
time for today it's getting late here so
I want to get editing this and then go

772
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,230
I want to get editing this and then go
 

773
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,920
I want to get editing this and then go
to bed

774
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:48,930
to bed
 

775
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,320
to bed
