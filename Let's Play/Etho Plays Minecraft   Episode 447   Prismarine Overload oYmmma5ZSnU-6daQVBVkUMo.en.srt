you might notice spawn rates are looking

34
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
you might notice spawn rates are looking
 

35
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,029
you might notice spawn rates are looking
pretty good right

36
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
pretty good right
 

37
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,430

cave lighting guys i lit up
 

41
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,869
cave lighting guys i lit up
the caves around this area for a couple

42
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
the caves around this area for a couple
 

43
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,310
the caves around this area for a couple
hours and man

44
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
hours and man
 

45
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,229

which is pretty awesome um let's head
down to the killing area

54
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080

 

55
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,550

good throw good throw yeah but i saw in

good throw good throw yeah but i saw in
 

57
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,990
good throw good throw yeah but i saw in
the comments something i did not know

58
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
the comments something i did not know
 

59
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,030
the comments something i did not know
you guys told me

60
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
you guys told me
 

61
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,789
you guys told me
that if i cover over the water

62
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
that if i cover over the water
 

63
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,429
that if i cover over the water
apparently it makes the spawning rates

64
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
apparently it makes the spawning rates
 

65
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,230
apparently it makes the spawning rates
go way

66
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
go way
 

67
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,789
go way
up which i never saw anything about that

68
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
up which i never saw anything about that
 

69
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,350
up which i never saw anything about that
before

70
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
before
 

71
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,990
before
we're gonna try that up here in a little

72
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
we're gonna try that up here in a little
 

73
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,630
we're gonna try that up here in a little
while

74
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
while
 

75
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,070
while
but i'll just show you what it's like

76
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
but i'll just show you what it's like
 

77
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,469
but i'll just show you what it's like
right now i think i think just about all

78
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
right now i think i think just about all
 

79
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,550
right now i think i think just about all
the caves are lit up

80
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560

 

81
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,630

so pretty much all the time we have four

82
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
so pretty much all the time we have four
 

83
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,190
so pretty much all the time we have four
or five of them burning up down here

84
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
or five of them burning up down here
 

85
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,030
or five of them burning up down here
if it's daytime if it's nighttime that

86
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
if it's daytime if it's nighttime that
 

87
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,510
if it's daytime if it's nighttime that
this totally stops pretty much

88
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520

 

89
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,350

it was night time out there i just went

90
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
it was night time out there i just went
 

91
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,550
it was night time out there i just went
and grabbed the bed we're going to want

92
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
and grabbed the bed we're going to want
 

93
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,630
and grabbed the bed we're going to want
to have a bed down here so we can

94
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
to have a bed down here so we can
 

95
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,789
to have a bed down here so we can
uh like if we're semi afk i want to be

96
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
uh like if we're semi afk i want to be
 

97

99
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,469
able to sleep and skip the night
that way we get good mob moderates again

100
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
that way we get good mob moderates again
 

101
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,230
that way we get good mob moderates again
uh but yeah what i want to do here guys

102
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
uh but yeah what i want to do here guys
 

103
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,830
uh but yeah what i want to do here guys
is maybe just try to make this tunnel

104
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
is maybe just try to make this tunnel
 

105
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,190
is maybe just try to make this tunnel
look a little nicer you know

106
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
look a little nicer you know
 

107
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,670
look a little nicer you know
make it more uh polished so that if i

108
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
make it more uh polished so that if i
 

109
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,190
make it more uh polished so that if i
ever have to come down here it looks

110
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
ever have to come down here it looks
 

111
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,310
ever have to come down here it looks
half decent

112
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
half decent
 

113
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,510
half decent
we're gonna do the dark prismarine uh

114
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
we're gonna do the dark prismarine uh
 

115
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,029
we're gonna do the dark prismarine uh
diorite nether brick

116
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
diorite nether brick
 

117
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,550
diorite nether brick
and the other prismarine mix that we did

118
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
and the other prismarine mix that we did
 

119
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,190
and the other prismarine mix that we did
in the nether i really like that combo

120
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
in the nether i really like that combo
 

121
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,270
in the nether i really like that combo
hopefully it looks good here too

122
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280

 

123
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,430

i never do anything like diagonally i

124
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
i never do anything like diagonally i
 

125
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,750
i never do anything like diagonally i
don't i don't like the sharp corners it

126
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
don't i don't like the sharp corners it
 

127
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,110
don't i don't like the sharp corners it
creates you know

128
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
creates you know
 

129
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,190
creates you know
if i ever do something diagonally i

130
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
if i ever do something diagonally i
 

131
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,470
if i ever do something diagonally i
always find i have to like do this

132
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
always find i have to like do this
 

133
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,830
always find i have to like do this
otherwise i don't like it but if i do

134
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
otherwise i don't like it but if i do
 

135
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,630
otherwise i don't like it but if i do
that

136
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640

 

137
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,390

yeah i'm gonna have to make this wider

138
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
yeah i'm gonna have to make this wider
 

139
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,190
yeah i'm gonna have to make this wider
if i want to do that

140
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
if i want to do that
 

141
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,229
if i want to do that
okay actually i only have 34 diorite

142
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
okay actually i only have 34 diorite
 

143
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,630
okay actually i only have 34 diorite
left nearby i think i have some in my

144
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
left nearby i think i have some in my
 

145
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,070
left nearby i think i have some in my
speed mine but that's that's

146
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
speed mine but that's that's
 

147
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,710
speed mine but that's that's
a little ways away and i am feeling lazy

148
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
a little ways away and i am feeling lazy
 

149
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,390
a little ways away and i am feeling lazy
so let's try to make this

150
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
so let's try to make this
 

151
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,949
so let's try to make this
work let's try come up with a cool

152
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
work let's try come up with a cool
 

153
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,550
work let's try come up with a cool
looking pattern here if we can maybe

154
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
looking pattern here if we can maybe
 

155
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,070
looking pattern here if we can maybe
we'll go five blocks and then

156
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
we'll go five blocks and then
 

157
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,470
we'll go five blocks and then
another brick and

158
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
another brick and
 

159
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,509
another brick and
sea lantern sea lantern this might be a

160
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
sea lantern sea lantern this might be a
 

161
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,430
sea lantern sea lantern this might be a
little too simple simplistic but we'll

162
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
little too simple simplistic but we'll
 

163
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,790
little too simple simplistic but we'll
try it

164
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
try it
 

165
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,390
try it
uh i don't know how many of you are are

166
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
uh i don't know how many of you are are
 

167
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,149
uh i don't know how many of you are are
following the mojang updates i'm not

168
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159

uh yeah we we have a little viewing area
here where we can see them fall down

340
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
here where we can see them fall down
 

341
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,749
here where we can see them fall down
so this will try to make nice looking

342
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
so this will try to make nice looking
 

343
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,150
so this will try to make nice looking
and then over at this area here i left

344
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
and then over at this area here i left
 

345
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,670
and then over at this area here i left
some space we're gonna put the

346
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
some space we're gonna put the
 

347
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,070
some space we're gonna put the
chest down for storing the items we get

348
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
chest down for storing the items we get
 

349
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,430
chest down for storing the items we get
and we want to set up like the whole

350
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
and we want to set up like the whole
 

351
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,790
and we want to set up like the whole
item filter stuff

352
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
item filter stuff
 

353
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,550
item filter stuff
and all that too so i'm i'm thinking

354
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
and all that too so i'm i'm thinking
 

355
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,309
and all that too so i'm i'm thinking
let's just fill it up with chess we're

356
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
let's just fill it up with chess we're
 

357
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,629
let's just fill it up with chess we're
gonna go three tall

358
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
gonna go three tall
 

359
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,589
gonna go three tall
probably like that trap chest regular

360
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
probably like that trap chest regular
 

361
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:01,990
probably like that trap chest regular
chest

362
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
chest
 

363
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,710
chest
trap chest three tall four wide because

364
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
trap chest three tall four wide because
 

365
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,110
trap chest three tall four wide because
there is how many items there's

366
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
there is how many items there's
 

367
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,110
there is how many items there's
there's a prismarine shards we have the

368
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
there's a prismarine shards we have the
 

369
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,469
there's a prismarine shards we have the
crystals

370
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
crystals
 

371
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,589
crystals
fish uh might set up a cooked fish maker

372
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
fish uh might set up a cooked fish maker
 

373
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,629
fish uh might set up a cooked fish maker
thing

374
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
thing
 

375
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,510
thing
and there's squid ink and like garbage

376
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
and there's squid ink and like garbage
 

377
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,469
and there's squid ink and like garbage
items we'll

378
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
items we'll
 

379
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,790
items we'll
probably want to put into chests in case

380
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
probably want to put into chests in case
 

381
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,469
probably want to put into chests in case
like something

382
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
like something
 

383
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,230
like something
like a skeleton somehow gets into the

384
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
like a skeleton somehow gets into the
 

385
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,990
like a skeleton somehow gets into the
system and drops bones

386
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
system and drops bones
 

387
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,309
system and drops bones
kind of deal with that too and then on

388
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
kind of deal with that too and then on
 

389
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,909
kind of deal with that too and then on
this side we're going to do

390
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
this side we're going to do
 

391
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,430
this side we're going to do
more chests we're going to have tons of

392
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
more chests we're going to have tons of
 

393
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,550
more chests we're going to have tons of
storage here three tall again

394
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
storage here three tall again
 

395
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,510
storage here three tall again
uh this will be for the blocks though

396
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
uh this will be for the blocks though
 

397
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,270
uh this will be for the blocks though
because there is i think

398
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
because there is i think
 

399
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,710
because there is i think
four different types there's the sea

400
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
four different types there's the sea
 

401
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,110
four different types there's the sea
lanterns there's the bricks

402
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
lanterns there's the bricks
 

403
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,749
lanterns there's the bricks
the dark prismarine and the regular

404
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
the dark prismarine and the regular
 

405
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,350
the dark prismarine and the regular
stuff

406
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
stuff
 

407
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,110
stuff
so yeah those four will probably go over

408
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
so yeah those four will probably go over
 

409
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,790
so yeah those four will probably go over
here then we have this little extra

410
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
here then we have this little extra
 

411
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,150
here then we have this little extra
space too which

412
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
space too which
 

413
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,430
space too which
i do need a spot for the bed

414
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
i do need a spot for the bed
 

415
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,110
i do need a spot for the bed
so maybe that will go there uh also like

416
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
so maybe that will go there uh also like
 

417
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,070
so maybe that will go there uh also like
ender chest

418
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
ender chest
 

419
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,390
ender chest
and crafting all that kind of stuff we

420
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
and crafting all that kind of stuff we
 

421
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,909
and crafting all that kind of stuff we
kind of need a little workstation you

422
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
kind of need a little workstation you
 

423
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,710
kind of need a little workstation you
know

424
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
know
 

425
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,390
know
so that will probably be in this little

426
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
so that will probably be in this little
 

427
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,029
so that will probably be in this little
section

428
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039

 

429
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,189

so the plan is to do the item filter

430
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
so the plan is to do the item filter
 

431
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,150
so the plan is to do the item filter
thing so

432
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
thing so
 

433
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,350
thing so
probably go something like this where we

434
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
probably go something like this where we
 

435
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,070
probably go something like this where we
don't have our hoppers i think i left

436
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
don't have our hoppers i think i left
 

437
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,189
don't have our hoppers i think i left
them in here

438
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
them in here
 

439
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,390
them in here
yeah i ran out of iron so fast like you

440
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
yeah i ran out of iron so fast like you
 

441
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,469
yeah i ran out of iron so fast like you
make a stack of hoppers and it's just

442
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
make a stack of hoppers and it's just
 

443
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:24,950
make a stack of hoppers and it's just
like

444
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
like
 

445
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,710
like
you feel bad after because you're broke

446
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
you feel bad after because you're broke
 

447
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,230
you feel bad after because you're broke
again

448
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
again
 

449
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,350
again
um yeah just like do that in the back of

450
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
um yeah just like do that in the back of
 

451
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,990
um yeah just like do that in the back of
all them

452
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
all them
 

453
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,790
all them
have the item filter uh before that and

454
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
have the item filter uh before that and
 

455
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,790
have the item filter uh before that and
then somehow move the items up

456
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
then somehow move the items up
 

457
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,469
then somehow move the items up
probably with a dropper elevator or

458
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
probably with a dropper elevator or
 

459
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,990
probably with a dropper elevator or
something we'll

460
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
something we'll
 

461
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,790
something we'll
see then on this end we have the

462
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
see then on this end we have the
 

463
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,710
see then on this end we have the
elevator

464
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
elevator
 

465
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,550
elevator
which we kind of need to do one more

466
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
which we kind of need to do one more
 

467
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,430
which we kind of need to do one more
thing here

468
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440

 

469
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,430

maybe in this two by two space we'll

470
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
maybe in this two by two space we'll
 

471
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,949
maybe in this two by two space we'll
make a little drop zone to fall down

472
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
make a little drop zone to fall down
 

473
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,150
make a little drop zone to fall down
here because we have no way of getting

474
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
here because we have no way of getting
 

475
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,670
here because we have no way of getting
down here now

476
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
down here now
 

477
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,389
down here now
that i've sealed this all off so where's

478
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
that i've sealed this all off so where's
 

479
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,110
that i've sealed this all off so where's
our position minus 267

480
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
our position minus 267
 

481
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,829
our position minus 267
676 you think i didn't remember that

482
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839

 

483
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,070

i should maybe like where the pistons

484
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
i should maybe like where the pistons
 

485
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,350
i should maybe like where the pistons
are maybe i should try to make that look

486
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
are maybe i should try to make that look
 

487
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,630
are maybe i should try to make that look
nicer too

488
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640

 

489
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,710

i forgot i know 676 was one of the

490
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
i forgot i know 676 was one of the
 

491
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,750
i forgot i know 676 was one of the
numbers

492
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760

 

493
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,430

i'm gonna dig down here and hope

494
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
i'm gonna dig down here and hope
 

495
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,070
i'm gonna dig down here and hope
hopefully i got that right

496
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
hopefully i got that right
 

497
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,829
hopefully i got that right
aha i got it right all right everyone so

498
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
aha i got it right all right everyone so
 

499
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,389
aha i got it right all right everyone so
i've been

that way almost at
our level actually now that i think of

578
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
our level actually now that i think of
 

579
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,870
our level actually now that i think of
it

580
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
it
 

581
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,550

moment and then on this side we got the
 

599
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,269
moment and then on this side we got the
blocks

600

problem possibly because it's like this

834
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
problem possibly because it's like this
 

835
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,110
problem possibly because it's like this
farm is almost too good now

836
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
farm is almost too good now
 

837
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,110
farm is almost too good now
if it gets items too quickly

838
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
if it gets items too quickly
 

839
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,350
if it gets items too quickly
it will get stuck on one item like it'll

840
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
it will get stuck on one item like it'll
 

841
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,150
it will get stuck on one item like it'll
never

842
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
never
 

843
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,389
never
like let's say it's fish let's say fish

844
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
like let's say it's fish let's say fish
 

845
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,509
like let's say it's fish let's say fish
is first

846
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
is first
 

847
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,790
is first
it will only ever put out fish it won't

848
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
it will only ever put out fish it won't
 

849
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,110
it will only ever put out fish it won't
go

850
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
go
 

851
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,550
go
it won't move on to the shards it won't

852
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
it won't move on to the shards it won't
 

853
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,550
it won't move on to the shards it won't
move on to the crystals it's just like

854
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
move on to the crystals it's just like
 

855
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,949
move on to the crystals it's just like
constant fish flow through this whole

856
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
constant fish flow through this whole
 

857
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,069
constant fish flow through this whole
thing

858
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
thing
 

859
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,430
thing
and you know we can't really just add

860
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
and you know we can't really just add
 

861
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,550
and you know we can't really just add
more

862
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
more
 

863
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,230
more
another row of hoppers or something like

864
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
another row of hoppers or something like
 

865
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,150
another row of hoppers or something like
that because we

866
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
that because we
 

867
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,670
that because we
we only have like the item filter here

868
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
we only have like the item filter here
 

869
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,629
we only have like the item filter here
can only process

870
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
can only process
 

871
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,790
can only process
it so quickly unless we add more item

872
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
it so quickly unless we add more item
 

873
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,829
it so quickly unless we add more item
filters which i don't want to do

874
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839

 

875
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,470

um

876
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480

 

877
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,389

i took out the items here manually just

878
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
i took out the items here manually just
 

879
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,910
i took out the items here manually just
to see if it could catch up or

880
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
to see if it could catch up or
 

881
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,189
to see if it could catch up or
keep up and it's sort of on the

882
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
keep up and it's sort of on the
 

883
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,350
keep up and it's sort of on the
fence maybe maybe it is keeping up

884
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
fence maybe maybe it is keeping up
 

885
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,870
fence maybe maybe it is keeping up
actually

886
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
actually
 

887
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,790
actually
it's hard to say it might be night time

888
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
it's hard to say it might be night time
 

889
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,829
it's hard to say it might be night time
now though

890
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839

 

891
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,790

oh man i didn't even cover over the

892
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
oh man i didn't even cover over the
 

893
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,150
oh man i didn't even cover over the
water yet i don't think we're gonna do

894
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
water yet i don't think we're gonna do
 

895
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,910
water yet i don't think we're gonna do
that if that's the case

896
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
that if that's the case
 

897
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,749
that if that's the case
because then this definitely won't keep

898
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
because then this definitely won't keep
 

899
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,750
because then this definitely won't keep
up if that increases the spawn rates

900
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
up if that increases the spawn rates
 

901
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,309
up if that increases the spawn rates
all right let's go over here is it

902
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
all right let's go over here is it
 

903
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,150
all right let's go over here is it
nighttime please don't be night time

904
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
nighttime please don't be night time
 

905
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,189
nighttime please don't be night time

906
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
it's it's daytime okay
 

907
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,270
it's it's daytime okay
so it can keep up i think it can keep up

908
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
so it can keep up i think it can keep up
 

909
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,549
so it can keep up i think it can keep up
it's good

910
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
it's good
 

911
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,309
it's good
okay yeah now that it's totally caught

912
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
okay yeah now that it's totally caught
 

913
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,870
okay yeah now that it's totally caught
up you can hear the droppers again

914
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
up you can hear the droppers again
 

915
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,390
up you can hear the droppers again
that's confirmation that it can keep up

916
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
that's confirmation that it can keep up
 

917
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,309
that's confirmation that it can keep up
uh which is good but it's also bad

918
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
uh which is good but it's also bad
 

919
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,669
uh which is good but it's also bad
because now we can hear the droppers

920
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
because now we can hear the droppers
 

921
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,150
because now we can hear the droppers
again

922
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
again
 

923
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,590
again
every so often

924
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
every so often
 

925
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,789
every so often
which is annoying uh but yeah anyways

926
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
which is annoying uh but yeah anyways
 

927
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,710
which is annoying uh but yeah anyways
we're gonna add one last thing to our

928
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
we're gonna add one last thing to our
 

929
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,230
we're gonna add one last thing to our
system

930
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
system
 

931
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,870
system
uh for today anyway basically we're

932
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
uh for today anyway basically we're
 

933
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,830
uh for today anyway basically we're
gonna want to add

934
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
gonna want to add
 

935
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,830
gonna want to add
in uh a lava kill machine

936
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
in uh a lava kill machine
 

937
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,430
in uh a lava kill machine
sort of thing so any drops that don't

938
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
sort of thing so any drops that don't
 

939
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,430
sort of thing so any drops that don't
get filtered

940
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
get filtered
 

941
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,669
get filtered
are going to end up in this dropper here

942
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
are going to end up in this dropper here
 

943
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,510
are going to end up in this dropper here
like any garbage

944
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
like any garbage
 

945
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,070
like any garbage
goes into there also like when those

946
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
goes into there also like when those
 

947
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,470
goes into there also like when those
chests fill up with shards or whatever

948
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
chests fill up with shards or whatever
 

949
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,070
chests fill up with shards or whatever
we sort of have to deal with them

950
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
we sort of have to deal with them
 

951
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,669
we sort of have to deal with them
otherwise it's gonna back up and all

952
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
otherwise it's gonna back up and all
 

953
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,110
otherwise it's gonna back up and all
these hoppers

954
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
these hoppers
 

955
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,110
these hoppers
all the way down the line and then

956
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
all the way down the line and then
 

957
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,950
all the way down the line and then
nothing will be able to

958
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
nothing will be able to
 

959
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,710
nothing will be able to
get filtered through it's just gonna

960
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
get filtered through it's just gonna
 

961
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,310
get filtered through it's just gonna
stop the whole system

962
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
stop the whole system
 

963
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,549
stop the whole system
but if we have something like this where

964
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
but if we have something like this where
 

965
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,350
but if we have something like this where
we deal with

966
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
we deal with
 

967
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,669
we deal with
items like if we have any garbage

968
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679

 

969
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,350

just automatically get automatically

970
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
just automatically get automatically
 

971
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,270
just automatically get automatically
gets ejected in there also helps to

972
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
gets ejected in there also helps to
 

973
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,870
gets ejected in there also helps to
reduce leg hopefully

974
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
reduce leg hopefully
 

975
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,630
reduce leg hopefully
although it causes a bit of lag because

976
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
although it causes a bit of lag because
 

977
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,230
although it causes a bit of lag because
of the clock

978
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
of the clock
 

979
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,909
of the clock
but we won't have all these items that's

980
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
but we won't have all these items that's
 

981
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,070
but we won't have all these items that's
kind of sitting around either

982
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
kind of sitting around either
 

983
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,070
kind of sitting around either
that can't be picked up it'll it'll pick

984
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
that can't be picked up it'll it'll pick
 

985
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,590
that can't be picked up it'll it'll pick
them up and deal with them

986
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
them up and deal with them
 

987
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,830
them up and deal with them
so yeah i think that should be good

988
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
so yeah i think that should be good
 

989
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,669
so yeah i think that should be good

and like pistons
 

1043
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,070
and like pistons
um to switch between the sets uh what i

1044
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
um to switch between the sets uh what i
 

1045
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,230

picks that kind of stuff because

1064
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
picks that kind of stuff because
 

1065
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,950
picks that kind of stuff because
don't really have enough space in our

1066
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
don't really have enough space in our
 

1067
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,510
don't really have enough space in our
storage room in the man cave

1068
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
storage room in the man cave
 

1069
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,230
storage room in the man cave
fills up pretty quickly so let's do a

1070
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
fills up pretty quickly so let's do a
 

1071
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,750
fills up pretty quickly so let's do a
little bit of theory crafting a little a

1072
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
little bit of theory crafting a little a
 

1073
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,070
little bit of theory crafting a little a
little fun with minecarts

1074
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
little fun with minecarts
 

1075
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,950
little fun with minecarts
i want to show you a couple cool ideas

1076
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
i want to show you a couple cool ideas
 

1077
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,549
i want to show you a couple cool ideas
so

1078
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
so
 

1079
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,310
so
we have our armor stand right with our

1080
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
we have our armor stand right with our
 

1081
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,590
we have our armor stand right with our
armor on we're going to want to be

1082
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
armor on we're going to want to be
 

1083
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,430
armor on we're going to want to be
able to switch between them in a very

1084
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
able to switch between them in a very
 

1085
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,950
able to switch between them in a very
nice way so probably

1086
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
nice way so probably
 

1087
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,909
nice way so probably
just have a button or something hey you

1088
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919

 

1089
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,669

have a button we press when we press the

1090
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
have a button we press when we press the
 

1091
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,669
have a button we press when we press the
button we want this armor stand to go

1092
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
button we want this armor stand to go
 

1093
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,149
button we want this armor stand to go
away

1094
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
away
 

1095
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,590
away
and then we want a new one to take its

1096
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
and then we want a new one to take its
 

1097
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,270
and then we want a new one to take its
place okay

1098
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
place okay
 

1099
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,110
place okay
so probably what we'll do is have

1100
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120

 

1101
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,590

one more in or so no i did that wrong

1102
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
one more in or so no i did that wrong
 

1103
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,669
one more in or so no i did that wrong
probably do something like this so we

1104
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
probably do something like this so we
 

1105
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,950
probably do something like this so we
press the button

1106
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
press the button
 

1107
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,350
press the button
when we press the button this piston

1108
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
when we press the button this piston
 

1109
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,149
when we press the button this piston
retracts

1110
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
retracts
 

1111
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,110
retracts
something like that it'll drop it down

1112
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
something like that it'll drop it down
 

1113
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,750
something like that it'll drop it down
out of the way

1114
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
out of the way
 

1115
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,029
out of the way
go away arm stand and then

1116
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
go away arm stand and then
 

1117
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,029
go away arm stand and then
when the button unpresses the block goes

1118
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
when the button unpresses the block goes
 

1119
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,950
when the button unpresses the block goes
back the next armor stand falls down

1120
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
back the next armor stand falls down
 

1121
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,110
back the next armor stand falls down
and lands on top of this area or

1122
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
and lands on top of this area or
 

1123
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,310
and lands on top of this area or
something

1124
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
something
 

1125
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,070
something
to deal with this armor stand will drop

1126
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
to deal with this armor stand will drop
 

1127
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,590
to deal with this armor stand will drop
down

1128
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
down
 

1129
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,830
down
my plan is to use minecarts to move it

1130
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
my plan is to use minecarts to move it
 

1131
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,470
my plan is to use minecarts to move it
so we could have like a power rail sort

1132
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
so we could have like a power rail sort
 

1133
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,350
so we could have like a power rail sort
of situation

1134
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
of situation
 

1135
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,110
of situation
maybe a dispenser here full of mine

1136
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
maybe a dispenser here full of mine
 

1137
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,470
maybe a dispenser here full of mine
carts

1138
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480

 

1139
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,830

right or do we not want to do that

1140
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840

 

1141
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,470

um dispenser with minecarts in

1142
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
um dispenser with minecarts in
 

1143
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,990
um dispenser with minecarts in
trying to think of how to do this i

1144
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
trying to think of how to do this i
 

1145

my bad my bad that did not work because
 

1157
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,430
my bad my bad that did not work because
the power rail wasn't powered i think

1158
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
the power rail wasn't powered i think
 

1159
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,190
the power rail wasn't powered i think
let's try that again do we have

1160
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
let's try that again do we have
 

1161
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,390
let's try that again do we have
yes we do we can make levers

1162
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
yes we do we can make levers
 

1163
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,310
yes we do we can make levers
never leave home without levers they're

1164
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
never leave home without levers they're
 

1165
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,549
never leave home without levers they're
so useful

1166
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
so useful
 

1167
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,590
so useful
okay that did not work why did that not

1168
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
okay that did not work why did that not
 

1169
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,149
okay that did not work why did that not
work guys that's supposed to work

1170
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
work guys that's supposed to work
 

1171
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,549
work guys that's supposed to work
let's drop this one down

1172
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559

 

1173
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,230

okay there that time it worked i guess i

1174
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
okay there that time it worked i guess i
 

1175
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,230
okay there that time it worked i guess i
nudged it a little bit into the

1176
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
nudged it a little bit into the
 

1177
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,590
nudged it a little bit into the
side of the block and it didn't pick it

1178
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
side of the block and it didn't pick it
 

1179
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,350
side of the block and it didn't pick it
up then all right so we can have uh

1180
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
up then all right so we can have uh
 

1181
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,190
up then all right so we can have uh
armor stands and minecarts and we'll

1182
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
armor stands and minecarts and we'll
 

1183
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,190
armor stands and minecarts and we'll
move them around that way

1184
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
move them around that way
 

1185
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,789
move them around that way
and you'll notice the minecarts kind of

1186
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
and you'll notice the minecarts kind of
 

1187
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,149
and you'll notice the minecarts kind of
stack on top of each other we're going

1188
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
stack on top of each other we're going
 

1189
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,470
stack on top of each other we're going
to take advantage of that

1190
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
to take advantage of that
 

1191
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,990
to take advantage of that
pez dispenser mechanic with this build

1192
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
pez dispenser mechanic with this build
 

1193
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,230
pez dispenser mechanic with this build
let's go back up get out of here oh man

1194
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
let's go back up get out of here oh man
 

1195
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,270
let's go back up get out of here oh man
i'm wrecking all the ground

1196
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
i'm wrecking all the ground
 

1197
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,549
i'm wrecking all the ground
okay just want to leave this hole

1198
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559

 

1199
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,710

all right so the next part of this the

1200
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
all right so the next part of this the
 

1201
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,310
all right so the next part of this the
pez dispenser thing is where we're going

1202
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
pez dispenser thing is where we're going
 

1203
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,870
pez dispenser thing is where we're going
to store all the armor stands

1204
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
to store all the armor stands
 

1205
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,950
to store all the armor stands
uh i figured out something kind of cool

1206
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
uh i figured out something kind of cool
 

1207
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,630
uh i figured out something kind of cool
here today this might be a well-known

1208
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
here today this might be a well-known
 

1209
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,350
here today this might be a well-known
thing but i didn't know about it

1210
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
thing but i didn't know about it
 

1211
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,470
thing but i didn't know about it
basically

1212
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480

 

1213
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,270

we can still do pez dispenser setups

1214
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
we can still do pez dispenser setups
 

1215
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,669
we can still do pez dispenser setups
like if you have a sheep farm

1216
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
like if you have a sheep farm
 

1217
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,190
like if you have a sheep farm
and you want to keep them in a pez

1218
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
and you want to keep them in a pez
 

1219
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,710
and you want to keep them in a pez
dispenser like all the sheep

1220
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
dispenser like all the sheep
 

1221
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,669
dispenser like all the sheep
stacked up you can do that still um

1222
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
stacked up you can do that still um
 

1223
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,950
stacked up you can do that still um
there's a really cool trick

1224
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
there's a really cool trick
 

1225
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,390
there's a really cool trick
for separating them basically

1226
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400

 

1227
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,789

okay so here's our armor stand right

1228
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
okay so here's our armor stand right
 

1229
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,950
okay so here's our armor stand right
minecart goes into it

1230
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
minecart goes into it
 

1231
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,070
minecart goes into it
falls down let's do one more

1232
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080

 

1233
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,190

okay so they land directly on top of

1234
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
okay so they land directly on top of
 

1235
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,110
okay so they land directly on top of
each other stacked very nicely

1236
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
each other stacked very nicely
 

1237
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,430
each other stacked very nicely
the only problem is if you try to move

1238
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
the only problem is if you try to move
 

1239
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,909
the only problem is if you try to move
them with a piston or something

1240
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
them with a piston or something
 

1241
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,590
them with a piston or something
that happens and i think if you

1242
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
that happens and i think if you
 

1243
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,510
that happens and i think if you
have a rail there let's just try that

1244
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
have a rail there let's just try that
 

1245
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,230
have a rail there let's just try that
actually

1246
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240

 

1247
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,310

relearn some of the game mechanics here

1248
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
relearn some of the game mechanics here
 

1249
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,149
relearn some of the game mechanics here
i think when you have a rail there they

1250
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
i think when you have a rail there they
 

1251
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:50,870
i think when you have a rail there they
kind of stack

1252
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
kind of stack
 

1253
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,909
kind of stack
together if i'm not mistaken

1254
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919

 

1255
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,269

okay go go mine carts do your thing

1256
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
okay go go mine carts do your thing
 

1257
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,510
okay go go mine carts do your thing
do they go together yeah they go like

1258
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
do they go together yeah they go like
 

1259
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,750
do they go together yeah they go like
right inside each other that way

1260
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
right inside each other that way
 

1261
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,669
right inside each other that way
so we've got two mine carts there so you

1262
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
so we've got two mine carts there so you
 

1263
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,269
so we've got two mine carts there so you
can't have a rail you have to have

1264
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
can't have a rail you have to have
 

1265
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,950
can't have a rail you have to have
no rail here's the trick though

1266
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
no rail here's the trick though
 

1267
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,750
no rail here's the trick though
put down a slab like so with a sticky

1268
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
put down a slab like so with a sticky
 

1269
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,350
put down a slab like so with a sticky
piston

1270
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
piston
 

1271
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,230
piston
and now when we we stack them

1272
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240

 

1273
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,750

let's just put a few of them down maybe

1274
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
let's just put a few of them down maybe
 

1275
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,269
let's just put a few of them down maybe
we'll do three or four

1276
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
we'll do three or four
 

1277
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,269
we'll do three or four
this time i wish i could do this a lot

1278
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
this time i wish i could do this a lot
 

1279
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,710
this time i wish i could do this a lot
faster though

1280
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
faster though
 

1281
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,990
faster though
wasting time on the on the recording all

1282
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
wasting time on the on the recording all
 

1283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,950
wasting time on the on the recording all
right

1284
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
right
 

1285
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,990
right
and there we go four is good enough

1286
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
and there we go four is good enough
 

1287
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,870
and there we go four is good enough
so they stack very nicely and now when

1288
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
so they stack very nicely and now when
 

1289
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,750
so they stack very nicely and now when
we

1290
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
we
 

1291
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,510
we
activate this piston check out what

1292
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
activate this piston check out what
 

1293
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,110
activate this piston check out what
happens

1294
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
happens
 

1295
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,630
happens
it only pushes one and then the next one

1296
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
it only pushes one and then the next one
 

1297
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,950
it only pushes one and then the next one
lands on the piston arm so it actually

1298
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
lands on the piston arm so it actually
 

1299
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,990
lands on the piston arm so it actually
doesn't fall any further then when it

1300
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
doesn't fall any further then when it
 

1301
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,710
doesn't fall any further then when it
retracts

1302
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
retracts
 

1303
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,310
retracts
goes on and that way we can do it one by

1304
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
goes on and that way we can do it one by
 

1305
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,630
goes on and that way we can do it one by
one

1306
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
one
 

1307
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,110
one
it's a good way of separating them which

1308
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
it's a good way of separating them which
 

1309
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,070
it's a good way of separating them which
is pretty cool

1310
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080

 

1311
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,590

and here's another cool trick i don't

1312
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
and here's another cool trick i don't
 

1313
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,149
and here's another cool trick i don't
know how many of you know this

1314
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
know how many of you know this
 

1315
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,350
know how many of you know this
but if you have a power rail and a

1316
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
but if you have a power rail and a
 

1317
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,110
but if you have a power rail and a
minecart on top of a slab this

1318
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
minecart on top of a slab this
 

1319
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,950
minecart on top of a slab this
the minecart will actually fall through

1320
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
the minecart will actually fall through
 

1321
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,909
the minecart will actually fall through
the slab watch this

1322
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
the slab watch this
 

1323
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,230
the slab watch this
or not a power rail any rail just

1324
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
or not a power rail any rail just
 

1325
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,990
or not a power rail any rail just
automatically falls through it

1326
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
automatically falls through it
 

1327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,430
automatically falls through it
it's kind of a cool thing

1328
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440

 

1329
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,750

so i just set up a quick example here of

1330
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
so i just set up a quick example here of
 

1331
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,029
so i just set up a quick example here of
how it's going to work guys we'll finish

1332
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
how it's going to work guys we'll finish
 

1333
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,710
how it's going to work guys we'll finish
it up next time though

1334
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
it up next time though
 

1335
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,029
it up next time though
but basically i got a jet piston thing

1336
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
but basically i got a jet piston thing
 

1337
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,909
but basically i got a jet piston thing
over here so

1338
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
over here so
 

1339
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,029
over here so
when you pull a lever armor stand falls

1340
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
when you pull a lever armor stand falls
 

1341
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,510
when you pull a lever armor stand falls
down

1342
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
down
 

1343
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,430
down
goes away gets picked up by a minecart

1344
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
goes away gets picked up by a minecart
 

1345
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,190
goes away gets picked up by a minecart
put back on the top of the

1346
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
put back on the top of the
 

1347
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,390
put back on the top of the
pez dispenser top of the stack right

1348
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
pez dispenser top of the stack right
 

1349
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,070
pez dispenser top of the stack right
then another minecart is going to come

1350
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
then another minecart is going to come
 

1351
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,470
then another minecart is going to come
by with a different armor stand

1352
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
by with a different armor stand
 

1353
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,870
by with a different armor stand
and this will be gone

1354
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
and this will be gone
 

1355
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,510
and this will be gone
let's get rid of it and it has to get

1356
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
let's get rid of it and it has to get
 

1357
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,230
let's get rid of it and it has to get
out of the

1358
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
out of the
 

1359
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,590
out of the
the minecart though right it has to be

1360
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
the minecart though right it has to be
 

1361
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,950
the minecart though right it has to be
ejected from the mine cart so we're

1362
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
ejected from the mine cart so we're
 

1363
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,430
ejected from the mine cart so we're
going to use

1364
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
going to use
 

1365
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,630
going to use
activator rails to do that

1366
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
activator rails to do that
 

1367
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,549
activator rails to do that
so from the pez dispenser it's going to

1368
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
so from the pez dispenser it's going to
 

1369
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,630
so from the pez dispenser it's going to
come down this line

1370
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
come down this line
 

1371
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,990
come down this line
and basically

1372
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,000
and basically
 

1373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,269
and basically
it's a pretty simple thing actually

1374
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
it's a pretty simple thing actually
 

1375
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,710
it's a pretty simple thing actually
for some reason it doesn't let me place

1376
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
for some reason it doesn't let me place
 

1377
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,470
for some reason it doesn't let me place
an armor stand here i have to break the

1378
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
an armor stand here i have to break the
 

1379
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,149
an armor stand here i have to break the
the track first

1380
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
the track first
 

1381
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,230
the track first
don't know what that's about we are very

1382
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
don't know what that's about we are very
 

1383
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,669
don't know what that's about we are very
limited on space though like this is

1384
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
limited on space though like this is
 

1385
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,230
limited on space though like this is
this is the path right here so i got

1386
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
this is the path right here so i got
 

1387
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,470
this is the path right here so i got
like a too high space to work with here

1388
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
like a too high space to work with here
 

1389
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,990
like a too high space to work with here
i'm not exactly sure where the pez

1390
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
i'm not exactly sure where the pez
 

1391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,669
i'm not exactly sure where the pez
dispenser is going to go because it

1392
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
dispenser is going to go because it
 

1393
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,430
dispenser is going to go because it
needs a bit of vertical space

1394
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
needs a bit of vertical space
 

1395
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,950
needs a bit of vertical space
but yeah watch what watch what happens

1396
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
but yeah watch what watch what happens
 

1397
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,230
but yeah watch what watch what happens
here when we place the minecart down

1398
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
here when we place the minecart down
 

1399
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,630
here when we place the minecart down
it's going to pick up this armor stand

1400
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
it's going to pick up this armor stand
 

1401
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,549
it's going to pick up this armor stand
goes over the activator rail which

1402
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
goes over the activator rail which
 

1403
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,830
goes over the activator rail which
ejects it

1404
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
ejects it
 

1405
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,110
ejects it
then the minecart goes over this

1406
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
then the minecart goes over this
 

1407
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,430
then the minecart goes over this
detector rail which causes the piston to

1408
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,440
detector rail which causes the piston to
 

1409
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,430
detector rail which causes the piston to
push it off the track it lands right on

1410
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
push it off the track it lands right on
 

1411
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,149
push it off the track it lands right on
top that

1412
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
top that
 

1413
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,950
top that
the track here so really quickly it's

1414
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
the track here so really quickly it's
 

1415
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,950
the track here so really quickly it's
going to happen pushes it down the hole

1416
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
going to happen pushes it down the hole
 

1417
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,950
going to happen pushes it down the hole
lands on our spot down there and

1418
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
lands on our spot down there and
 

1419
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,390
lands on our spot down there and
that's our next next one uh basically

1420
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
that's our next next one uh basically
 

1421
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,310
that's our next next one uh basically
my inventory guys my inventory is so bad

1422
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
my inventory guys my inventory is so bad
 

1423
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,830
my inventory guys my inventory is so bad
right now

1424
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
right now
 

1425
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,470
right now
all right so this one falls down and

1426
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
all right so this one falls down and
 

1427
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,870
all right so this one falls down and
then

1428
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
then
 

1429
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,870
then
push a button cycles to the next one

1430
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
push a button cycles to the next one
 

1431
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,909
push a button cycles to the next one
same deal

1432
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
same deal
 

1433
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,230
same deal
goes down like that so that's that's a

1434
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
goes down like that so that's that's a
 

1435
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,669
goes down like that so that's that's a
general idea to it

1436
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
general idea to it
 

1437
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,710
general idea to it
we'll finish it up next time though yep

1438
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
we'll finish it up next time though yep
 

1439
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,470
we'll finish it up next time though yep
so let's finish up our episode here guys

1440
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
so let's finish up our episode here guys
 

1441
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,830
so let's finish up our episode here guys
with the comment of the day like we

1442
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
with the comment of the day like we
 

1443
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,549
with the comment of the day like we
usually do

1444
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
usually do
 

1445
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,310
usually do
we got a nice simple question here from

1446
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
we got a nice simple question here from
 

1447
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,590
we got a nice simple question here from
joshua

1448
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
joshua
 

1449
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,990
joshua
it says etho why don't you overclock

1450
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
it says etho why don't you overclock
 

1451
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,549
it says etho why don't you overclock
your cpu

1452
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
your cpu
 

1453
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,470
your cpu
i've done that in the past like when

1454
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
i've done that in the past like when
 

1455
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,269
i've done that in the past like when
overclocking first became a thing

1456
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
overclocking first became a thing
 

1457
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,630
overclocking first became a thing
and i had a nice fast computer but it

1458
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
and i had a nice fast computer but it
 

1459
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,070
and i had a nice fast computer but it
burnt out on me it did not last its full

1460
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
burnt out on me it did not last its full
 

1461
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,669
burnt out on me it did not last its full
length of time it only lasted like a

1462
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
length of time it only lasted like a
 

1463
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,789
length of time it only lasted like a
year or two

1464
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
year or two
 

1465
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,549
year or two
and then i got like a blue screen of

1466
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
and then i got like a blue screen of
 

1467
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,990
and then i got like a blue screen of
death and

1468
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
death and
 

1469
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,789
death and
basically fried the thing i think um had

1470
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
basically fried the thing i think um had
 

1471
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,310
basically fried the thing i think um had
to get a new computer

1472
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
to get a new computer
 

1473
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,470
to get a new computer
ever since then i haven't wanted to to

1474
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
ever since then i haven't wanted to to
 

1475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,830
ever since then i haven't wanted to to
really try it again i know

1476
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
really try it again i know
 

1477
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,830
really try it again i know
like there's a lot of science to it

1478
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
like there's a lot of science to it
 

1479
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,389
like there's a lot of science to it
there's uh safe ways of doing it

1480
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
there's uh safe ways of doing it
 

1481
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,070
there's uh safe ways of doing it
and i could probably read up on it and

1482
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
and i could probably read up on it and
 

1483
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,630
and i could probably read up on it and
figure it out but

1484
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
figure it out but
 

1485
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,870
figure it out but
um at the moment i don't know how to do

1486
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
um at the moment i don't know how to do
 

1487
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,990
um at the moment i don't know how to do
it it would be

1488
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
it it would be
 

1489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,230
it it would be
take a bit of time to figure it out but

1490
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
take a bit of time to figure it out but
 

1491
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,269
take a bit of time to figure it out but
