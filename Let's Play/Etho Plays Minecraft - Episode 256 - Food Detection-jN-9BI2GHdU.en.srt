21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,680
love that pattern that's amazing I think
it'll blow up if I change just one of

it'll blow up if I change just one of

00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
alright so a new snapshot has come out
 

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,380
alright so a new snapshot has come out
I'm rockin the oh nine a snapshot now

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:35,390
I'm rockin the oh nine a snapshot now

I'm rockin the oh nine a snapshot now
it's mostly a bug fix one but there was

38
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,140
it's mostly a bug fix one but there was
 

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,609
it's mostly a bug fix one but there was
some improved support for entities

40
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:42,619
some improved support for entities
 

41
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,529
some improved support for entities
working together like if you're on a

42
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:44,539
working together like if you're on a
 

43
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,209
working together like if you're on a
minecart and you leave the game and come

44
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:46,219
minecart and you leave the game and come
 

45
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,590
minecart and you leave the game and come
back you're still in the minecart

46
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
back you're still in the minecart
 

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,959
back you're still in the minecart
instead of out of it now that kind of

48
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:49,969
instead of out of it now that kind of
 

49
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:52,690
instead of out of it now that kind of
thing and one of the bug fixes that has

50
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:52,700
thing and one of the bug fixes that has
 

51
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,859
thing and one of the bug fixes that has
a big effect on me is they fixed it so

52
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:56,869
a big effect on me is they fixed it so
 

53
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,960
a big effect on me is they fixed it so
that hopper is always update comparators

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:58,970
that hopper is always update comparators
 

55
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,779
that hopper is always update comparators
now it I believe when an item passes

56
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:01,789
now it I believe when an item passes
 

57
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,249
now it I believe when an item passes
through so that was the problem we were

58
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:03,259
through so that was the problem we were
 

59
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,370
through so that was the problem we were
having last episode and we can try this

60
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:06,380
having last episode and we can try this
 

61
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,770
having last episode and we can try this
out before it was like kind of hit and

62
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:08,780
out before it was like kind of hit and
 

63
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,539
out before it was like kind of hit and
miss where it would detect the item here

64
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:12,549
miss where it would detect the item here
 

65
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,069
miss where it would detect the item here
now it seems to work every single time

66
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:15,079
now it seems to work every single time
 

67
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,920
now it seems to work every single time
which is awesome you see the junction

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:17,930
which is awesome you see the junction
 

69
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,280
which is awesome you see the junction
switching haven't had a fail once yet I

70
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,290
switching haven't had a fail once yet I
 

71
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,680
switching haven't had a fail once yet I
did have a little bit of trouble though

72
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,690
did have a little bit of trouble though
 

73
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,000
did have a little bit of trouble though
I don't know if it was due to the

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,010
I don't know if it was due to the
 

75
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,280
I don't know if it was due to the
snapshots or if I just didn't notice it

76
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,290
snapshots or if I just didn't notice it
 

77
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,759
snapshots or if I just didn't notice it
before but this cart was picking up more

78
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:33,769
before but this cart was picking up more
 

79
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,349
before but this cart was picking up more
than one item sometime and I fixed that

80
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:38,359
than one item sometime and I fixed that
 

81
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,629
than one item sometime and I fixed that
by just adding an extra delay on this

82
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:40,639
by just adding an extra delay on this
 

83
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,449
by just adding an extra delay on this
repeater before I had it one if I switch

84
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:43,459
repeater before I had it one if I switch
 

85
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,960
repeater before I had it one if I switch
it to if I have it at two it doesn't

86
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:46,970
it to if I have it at two it doesn't
 

87
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,300
it to if I have it at two it doesn't
seem to have that problem but if we have

88
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,310
seem to have that problem but if we have
 

89
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,750
seem to have that problem but if we have
it at one like is now if we do this

90
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,760
it at one like is now if we do this
 

91
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,509
it at one like is now if we do this
enough times I'm sure we'll see it fail

92
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519

 

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,400

or not come on

94
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,410
or not come on
 

95
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:08,500
or not come on
fail there we go yeah so the time before

96
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,510
fail there we go yeah so the time before
 

97
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,990
fail there we go yeah so the time before
I picked up two items so this was at 17

98
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
I picked up two items so this was at 17
 

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,120
I picked up two items so this was at 17
and when we threw one in now it brought

100
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,130
and when we threw one in now it brought
 

101
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:20,009
and when we threw one in now it brought
it back up to 18 this first number

102
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:20,019

 

103
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,650

alright but as it is now we're still

104
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:23,660
alright but as it is now we're still
 

105
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,199
alright but as it is now we're still
having one problem with it that I

106
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,209
having one problem with it that I
 

107
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,069
having one problem with it that I
haven't quite figured out a solution to

108
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:29,079
haven't quite figured out a solution to
 

109
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,170
haven't quite figured out a solution to
when the hopper minecart passes by it

110
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,180
when the hopper minecart passes by it
 

111
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,280
when the hopper minecart passes by it
sometimes

112
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,290
sometimes
 

113
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,839
sometimes
doesn't drop off the item still even

114
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:36,849
doesn't drop off the item still even
 

115
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,130
doesn't drop off the item still even
I've even slowed it down quite a bit

116
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,140
I've even slowed it down quite a bit
 

117
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,990
I've even slowed it down quite a bit
here more than I would like and it still

118
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,000
here more than I would like and it still
 

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,459
here more than I would like and it still
has issues like the junction didn't

120
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:45,469
has issues like the junction didn't
 

121
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,140
has issues like the junction didn't
switch that time because the item didn't

122
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,150
switch that time because the item didn't
 

123
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,069
switch that time because the item didn't
go to the hopper down here most of the

124
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:51,079
go to the hopper down here most of the
 

125
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,780
go to the hopper down here most of the
time though like it's much better than

126
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,790
time though like it's much better than
 

127
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,119
time though like it's much better than
it was last episode most the time it

128
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:55,129
it was last episode most the time it
 

129
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:02,349
it was last episode most the time it
does work try it one more time have face

130
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:02,359
does work try it one more time have face
 

131
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:08,319
does work try it one more time have face
that it will work this time Ariel yeah

132
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,329
that it will work this time Ariel yeah
 

133
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,199
that it will work this time Ariel yeah
I'm finding most of time orcs now I'll

134
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,209
I'm finding most of time orcs now I'll
 

135
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,399
I'm finding most of time orcs now I'll
probably just have to slow it down a

136
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:12,409
probably just have to slow it down a
 

137
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,360
probably just have to slow it down a
little bit more and all should be good

138
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,370
little bit more and all should be good
 

139
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,039
little bit more and all should be good
uh-huh

140
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:18,049
uh-huh
 

141
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,050
uh-huh
but other than that new in the snapshot

142
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,060
but other than that new in the snapshot
 

143
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,469
but other than that new in the snapshot
they also added one more option with

144
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:23,479
they also added one more option with
 

145
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,920
they also added one more option with
smooth lighting when you have the choice

146
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:26,930
smooth lighting when you have the choice
 

147
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,620
smooth lighting when you have the choice
of off minimum and maximum before it was

148
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,630
of off minimum and maximum before it was
 

149
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,650
of off minimum and maximum before it was
this on and off now I don't really know

150
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:35,660
this on and off now I don't really know
 

151
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,180
this on and off now I don't really know
what the difference is between minimum

152
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,190
what the difference is between minimum
 

153
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,620
what the difference is between minimum
and maximum though it looks pretty much

154
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,630
and maximum though it looks pretty much
 

155
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,320
and maximum though it looks pretty much
the same to me maybe if I go in a cave

156
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,330
the same to me maybe if I go in a cave
 

157
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,250
the same to me maybe if I go in a cave
we'll see it better

158
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,260

 

159
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,480

okay next mom I can't tell the

160
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,490
okay next mom I can't tell the
 

161
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:59,170
okay next mom I can't tell the
difference minimum they probably just

162
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,180
difference minimum they probably just
 

163
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,370
difference minimum they probably just
smooths it out a little bit more yeah

164
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,380
smooths it out a little bit more yeah
 

165
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,170
smooths it out a little bit more yeah
a lot of mobs here let's just check this

166
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,180
a lot of mobs here let's just check this
 

167
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:20,200
a lot of mobs here let's just check this
out okay yeah there's a lot oh man

168
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,210
out okay yeah there's a lot oh man
 

169
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,500
out okay yeah there's a lot oh man
that's how you enter a cave oh man

170
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,510
that's how you enter a cave oh man
 

171
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:33,320
that's how you enter a cave oh man
skeleton skeleton must not be able to

172
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,330
skeleton skeleton must not be able to
 

173
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,100
skeleton skeleton must not be able to
get here sounds like oh there's a room

174
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,110
get here sounds like oh there's a room
 

175
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:47,390
get here sounds like oh there's a room
there too I see I would love to find

176
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
there too I see I would love to find
 

177
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,520
there too I see I would love to find
like some more spawners around this area

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,530
like some more spawners around this area
 

179
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,510
like some more spawners around this area
because this is near my my man cave and

180
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
because this is near my my man cave and
 

181
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,550
because this is near my my man cave and
there's there's a few kids I haven't

182
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
there's there's a few kids I haven't
 

183
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,700
there's there's a few kids I haven't
explored here it seems that team dead

184
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,710
explored here it seems that team dead
 

185
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,710
explored here it seems that team dead
ended pretty quick I'm afraid I only

186
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:03,720
ended pretty quick I'm afraid I only
 

187
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,750
ended pretty quick I'm afraid I only
used like 15 torches to light it all up

188
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:05,760
used like 15 torches to light it all up
 

189
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,170
used like 15 torches to light it all up
so not much there but I got this thing

190
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,180
so not much there but I got this thing
 

191
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,760
so not much there but I got this thing
here to show you guys I thought this was

192
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:10,770
here to show you guys I thought this was
 

193
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,310
here to show you guys I thought this was
pretty cool and I'm gonna give you like

194
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,320
pretty cool and I'm gonna give you like
 

195
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,750
pretty cool and I'm gonna give you like
a water challenge or a water puzzle here

196
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:16,760
a water challenge or a water puzzle here
 

197
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,880
a water challenge or a water puzzle here
can you figure out how I did this I'm

198
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:19,890
can you figure out how I did this I'm
 

199
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,980
can you figure out how I did this I'm
not gonna give you the answer try it out

200
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:21,990
not gonna give you the answer try it out
 

201
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,930
not gonna give you the answer try it out
your cells and see if you can replicate

202
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:26,940
your cells and see if you can replicate
 

203
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,980
your cells and see if you can replicate
it because this is this is pretty cool

204
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:32,990

 

205
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,960

alright have fun with that okay

206
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:38,970
alright have fun with that okay
 

207
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,310
alright have fun with that okay
everybody I got another thing I want to

208
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,320
everybody I got another thing I want to
 

209
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,750
everybody I got another thing I want to
show you here this is just a really

210
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:41,760
show you here this is just a really
 

211
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,910
show you here this is just a really
simple redstone trick you might find

212
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:43,920
simple redstone trick you might find
 

213
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,560
simple redstone trick you might find
useful

214
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,570
useful
 

215
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,720
useful
with these new comparators there's a

216
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,730
with these new comparators there's a
 

217
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,520
with these new comparators there's a
common problem I see people trying to

218
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,530
common problem I see people trying to
 

219
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,280
common problem I see people trying to
work out and like we have these

220
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,290
work out and like we have these
 

221
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,380
work out and like we have these
different length redstone signals now

222
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,390
different length redstone signals now
 

223
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,210
different length redstone signals now
that come up often and you might want

224
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:56,220
that come up often and you might want
 

225
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,720
that come up often and you might want
something to happen if the signal gets

226
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,730
something to happen if the signal gets
 

227
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,780
something to happen if the signal gets
let's say three blocks down down the

228
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:02,790
let's say three blocks down down the
 

229
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,730
let's say three blocks down down the
line here but if it goes beyond that

230
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
line here but if it goes beyond that
 

231
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,920
line here but if it goes beyond that
you don't want that thing to happen

232
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:06,930
you don't want that thing to happen
 

233
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,050
you don't want that thing to happen
right so if you just use a repeater or

234
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,060
right so if you just use a repeater or
 

235
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,690
right so if you just use a repeater or
or branch the signal off from there

236
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:15,700

 

237
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,060

you can see it's four blocks down it's

238
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,070
you can see it's four blocks down it's
 

239
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,280
you can see it's four blocks down it's
past where we want to do the check and

240
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,290
past where we want to do the check and
 

241
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,860
past where we want to do the check and
this is still powered so we don't want

242
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:22,870
this is still powered so we don't want
 

243
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,910
this is still powered so we don't want
that we want that to be off so I've seen

244
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:26,920
that we want that to be off so I've seen
 

245
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,010
that we want that to be off so I've seen
people use like locking repeaters in and

246
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,020
people use like locking repeaters in and
 

247
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,480
people use like locking repeaters in and
things like that to to do it but a

248
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,490
things like that to to do it but a
 

249
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,500
things like that to to do it but a
really simple thing I found is you get a

250
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,510
really simple thing I found is you get a
 

251
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,870
really simple thing I found is you get a
redstone torch first then the repeater

252
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:39,880
redstone torch first then the repeater
 

253
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,590
redstone torch first then the repeater
and another torch they're connected the

254
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:46,600
and another torch they're connected the
 

255
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,990
and another torch they're connected the
wire together and that's it so let's

256
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
wire together and that's it so let's
 

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,490
wire together and that's it so let's
just put out an old block here so we can

258
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:53,500
just put out an old block here so we can
 

259
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:03,920
just put out an old block here so we can
get a better idea what's going on so now

260
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:03,930

 

261
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,080

that went down it goes two blocks three

262
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,090
that went down it goes two blocks three
 

263
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,270
that went down it goes two blocks three
blocks and that's when we want it to

264
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,280
blocks and that's when we want it to
 

265
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,760
blocks and that's when we want it to
activate right but then we don't want to

266
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:14,770
activate right but then we don't want to
 

267
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,980
activate right but then we don't want to
activate at four blocks so let's we're

268
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:19,990
activate at four blocks so let's we're
 

269
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,450
activate at four blocks so let's we're
down to two let's go to four and that

270
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:24,460
down to two let's go to four and that
 

271
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,490
down to two let's go to four and that
will happen when we flip this up that's

272
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:26,500
will happen when we flip this up that's
 

273
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,290
will happen when we flip this up that's
three before all right so it's it's gone

274
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,300
three before all right so it's it's gone
 

275
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,150
three before all right so it's it's gone
beyond there and this repeater just

276
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,160
beyond there and this repeater just
 

277
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,190
beyond there and this repeater just
basically cancels the signal out because

278
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
basically cancels the signal out because
 

279
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
basically cancels the signal out because
they have the same tick and it keeps

280
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,010
they have the same tick and it keeps
 

281
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,840
they have the same tick and it keeps
this powered so we can do a range check

282
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:42,850
this powered so we can do a range check
 

283
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,450
this powered so we can do a range check
basically with this like even if like if

284
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:45,460
basically with this like even if like if
 

285
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,100
basically with this like even if like if
we want something happen from 3 2 3 4 5

286
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,110
we want something happen from 3 2 3 4 5
 

287
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:58,710
we want something happen from 3 2 3 4 5
6 we can do it this way to you and yeah

288
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
6 we can do it this way to you and yeah
 

289
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,740
6 we can do it this way to you and yeah
just just a simple thing so if you want

290
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:01,750
just just a simple thing so if you want
 

291
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,750
just just a simple thing so if you want
to stuff to happen in a certain range

292
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
to stuff to happen in a certain range
 

293
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,170
to stuff to happen in a certain range
that's how you can do it and here's just

294
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,180
that's how you can do it and here's just
 

295
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,670
that's how you can do it and here's just
an example of when that might come up

296
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
an example of when that might come up
 

297
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,750
an example of when that might come up
like jukeboxes you put a comparator next

298
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
like jukeboxes you put a comparator next
 

299
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,670
like jukeboxes you put a comparator next
to them different records will send out

300
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
to them different records will send out
 

301
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,810
to them different records will send out
different lengths of a signal now so the

302
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:21,820
different lengths of a signal now so the
 

303
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,890
different lengths of a signal now so the
gold record for example

304
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:23,900
gold record for example
 

305
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,620
gold record for example
it only goes one block while what's this

306
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,630
it only goes one block while what's this
 

307
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,240
it only goes one block while what's this
one

308
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,250
one
 

309
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,350
one
mellow hi we'll go all the way up to

310
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
mellow hi we'll go all the way up to
 

311
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,210
mellow hi we'll go all the way up to
here and I got these checkers set up

312
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,220
here and I got these checkers set up
 

313
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,110
here and I got these checkers set up
watch what happens when you put

314
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
watch what happens when you put
 

315
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,150
watch what happens when you put
different records in this so you can use

316
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,160
different records in this so you can use
 

317
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,010
different records in this so you can use
these records as a key system basically

318
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,020
these records as a key system basically
 

319
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,700
these records as a key system basically
gold record only this one came on that

320
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:51,710
gold record only this one came on that
 

321
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,340
gold record only this one came on that

was looking at the pet project plan and

344
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:29,560
was looking at the pet project plan and
 

345
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,350
was looking at the pet project plan and
I think we'll focus on hunger right now

346
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,360
I think we'll focus on hunger right now
 

347
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,300
I think we'll focus on hunger right now
pet needs to be fed frequently hunger

348
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,310
pet needs to be fed frequently hunger
 

349
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,730
pet needs to be fed frequently hunger
dreams at a constant rate hunger can be

350
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:36,740
dreams at a constant rate hunger can be
 

351
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,470
dreams at a constant rate hunger can be
replenished with various meals and

352
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
replenished with various meals and
 

353
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,970
replenished with various meals and
snacks so it's thinking about it this is

354
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:42,980
snacks so it's thinking about it this is
 

355
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,190
snacks so it's thinking about it this is
actually gonna be pretty complicated so

356
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
actually gonna be pretty complicated so
 

357
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,760
actually gonna be pretty complicated so
we're going to simplify it as much as we

358
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:48,770
we're going to simplify it as much as we
 

359
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,110
we're going to simplify it as much as we
can we're only gonna have one type of

360
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,120
can we're only gonna have one type of
 

361
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,290
can we're only gonna have one type of
meal and one type of snack and also when

362
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:53,300
meal and one type of snack and also when
 

363
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,680
meal and one type of snack and also when
we feed them we can give a medicine if

364
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:56,690
we feed them we can give a medicine if
 

365
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,430
we feed them we can give a medicine if
you get sick so that's a third item I

366
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
you get sick so that's a third item I
 

367
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,960
you get sick so that's a third item I
will I think the best thing to use for

368
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:01,970
will I think the best thing to use for
 

369
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,750
will I think the best thing to use for
that is gonna be golden apples I would

370
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:04,760
that is gonna be golden apples I would
 

371
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,790
that is gonna be golden apples I would
like to give them potions to make them

372
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
like to give them potions to make them
 

373
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,470
like to give them potions to make them
better but there's no real way of

374
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
better but there's no real way of
 

375
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,220
better but there's no real way of
detecting them there is but it's it's

376
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,230
detecting them there is but it's it's
 

377
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,780
detecting them there is but it's it's
kind of complicated and then finally a

378
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:16,790
kind of complicated and then finally a
 

379
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,030
kind of complicated and then finally a
fourth effect is if we give him

380
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
fourth effect is if we give him
 

381
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,340
fourth effect is if we give him
something he can't digest like if we

382
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,350
something he can't digest like if we
 

383
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,370
something he can't digest like if we
give him a piece of cobble it's gonna go

384
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,380
give him a piece of cobble it's gonna go
 

385
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,890
give him a piece of cobble it's gonna go
into a storage chest at the very end of

386
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:26,900
into a storage chest at the very end of
 

387
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,020
into a storage chest at the very end of
a line and have some minor negative

388
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,030
a line and have some minor negative
 

389
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,910
a line and have some minor negative
effect on him

390
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:32,920
effect on him
 

391
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,810
effect on him
this is

392
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:34,820
this is
 

393
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,720
this is
let's dig this out a little bit how

394
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:37,730
let's dig this out a little bit how
 

395
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,800
let's dig this out a little bit how
close are we to the southern wiring and

396
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:40,810
close are we to the southern wiring and
 

397
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:49,090
close are we to the southern wiring and
space is gonna be an issue okay now I

398
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,100
space is gonna be an issue okay now I
 

399
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,610
space is gonna be an issue okay now I
think the easiest way to do it would be

400
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:51,620
think the easiest way to do it would be
 

401
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,440
think the easiest way to do it would be
just to have a water stream here we

402
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,450
just to have a water stream here we
 

403
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,090
just to have a water stream here we
throw stuff instead of throwing it into

404
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,100
throw stuff instead of throwing it into
 

405
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,080
throw stuff instead of throwing it into
a hopper so we might do that water

406
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,090
a hopper so we might do that water
 

407
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,360
a hopper so we might do that water
stream and then it's gonna run over top

408
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,370
stream and then it's gonna run over top
 

409
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,060
stream and then it's gonna run over top
of hoppers

410
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,070
of hoppers
 

411
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:12,880
of hoppers
so there'll probably be one here the

412
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:12,890
so there'll probably be one here the
 

413
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,060
so there'll probably be one here the
issue is we have to detect when an item

414
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,070
issue is we have to detect when an item
 

415
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,400
issue is we have to detect when an item
enters into it and that's that's a

416
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,410
enters into it and that's that's a
 

417
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,020
enters into it and that's that's a
little tough we got to basically do what

418
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,030
little tough we got to basically do what
 

419
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,030
little tough we got to basically do what
we did at that minecart Junction we're

420
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
we did at that minecart Junction we're
 

421
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,380
we did at that minecart Junction we're
working at where we set up a storage

422
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,390
working at where we set up a storage
 

423
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,000
working at where we set up a storage
minecart underneath each of these

424
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,010
minecart underneath each of these
 

425
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,490
minecart underneath each of these
hoppers that we set up let's make it go

426
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,500
hoppers that we set up let's make it go
 

427
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,970
hoppers that we set up let's make it go
this way we'll have a power rail and a

428
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:39,980
this way we'll have a power rail and a
 

429
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,360
this way we'll have a power rail and a
storage minecarts okay and it's just

430
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,370
storage minecarts okay and it's just
 

431
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,860
storage minecarts okay and it's just
going to bounce back and forth so we'll

432
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:47,870
going to bounce back and forth so we'll
 

433
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:54,540
going to bounce back and forth so we'll
have that there out there we'll need a

434
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:54,550
have that there out there we'll need a
 

435
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,910
have that there out there we'll need a
solid block here okay this will be

436
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
solid block here okay this will be
 

437
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,060
solid block here okay this will be
powered this rail just put that there so

438
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,070
powered this rail just put that there so
 

439
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,650
powered this rail just put that there so
when something enters into this we

440
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:11,660
when something enters into this we
 

441
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,340
when something enters into this we
needed to make this cart move and then I

442
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,350
needed to make this cart move and then I
 

443
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,250
needed to make this cart move and then I
guess this carts gonna have to well no

444
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,260
guess this carts gonna have to well no
 

445
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,690
guess this carts gonna have to well no
it doesn't have to drop stuff off does

446
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:19,700
it doesn't have to drop stuff off does
 

447
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:28,270
it doesn't have to drop stuff off does
it no just needs to hold it but then we

448
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,280
it no just needs to hold it but then we
 

449
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,040
it no just needs to hold it but then we
got to set up like four of these hoppers

450
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,050
got to set up like four of these hoppers
 

451
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,520
got to set up like four of these hoppers
I'll just I'll just try wrap my head

452
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,530
I'll just I'll just try wrap my head
 

453
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,680
I'll just I'll just try wrap my head
around this for a second this is gonna

454
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:35,690
around this for a second this is gonna
 

455
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,330
around this for a second this is gonna
be tough and I tell you one thing about

456
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,340
be tough and I tell you one thing about
 

457
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,760
be tough and I tell you one thing about
like all these new redstone gadgets we

458
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:42,770
like all these new redstone gadgets we
 

459
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,260
like all these new redstone gadgets we
have it's

460
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,270
have it's
 

461
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,570
have it's
it's so much tougher to manage your

462
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:46,580
it's so much tougher to manage your
 

463
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,850
it's so much tougher to manage your
inventory because there's there's this

464
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:48,860
inventory because there's there's this
 

465
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,079
inventory because there's there's this
so many new items like you got

466
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,089
so many new items like you got
 

467
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,990
so many new items like you got
comparators you got there's a new type

468
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,000
comparators you got there's a new type
 

469
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,730
comparators you got there's a new type
of rail there's these hoppers there's

470
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:54,740
of rail there's these hoppers there's
 

471
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,110
of rail there's these hoppers there's
droppers there's like now if you do

472
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
droppers there's like now if you do
 

473
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,790
droppers there's like now if you do
redstone stuff a lot of times you need

474
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
redstone stuff a lot of times you need
 

475
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,440
redstone stuff a lot of times you need
minecart stuff you need to bring with

476
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,450
minecart stuff you need to bring with
 

477
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,180
minecart stuff you need to bring with
you so you better have a storage room

478
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,190
you so you better have a storage room
 

479
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,449
you so you better have a storage room
nearby otherwise it's going to be a pain

480
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:07,459
nearby otherwise it's going to be a pain
 

481
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,310
nearby otherwise it's going to be a pain
to get anything done you'll have to go

482
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,320
to get anything done you'll have to go
 

483
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,040
to get anything done you'll have to go
back and forth so many times this might

484
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,050
back and forth so many times this might
 

485
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,460
back and forth so many times this might
actually not be too bad to do one thing

486
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,470
actually not be too bad to do one thing
 

487
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,329
actually not be too bad to do one thing
I forgot about those will be doing stuff

488
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:21,339
I forgot about those will be doing stuff
 

489
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,880
I forgot about those will be doing stuff
with these ports as well so we want to

490
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:24,890
with these ports as well so we want to
 

491
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,660
with these ports as well so we want to
try build away from these as much as we

492
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:28,670
try build away from these as much as we
 

493
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,600
try build away from these as much as we
can so we're gonna go this way towards

494
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:30,610
can so we're gonna go this way towards
 

495
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,329
can so we're gonna go this way towards
Wilson's face here and hopefully not run

496
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:34,339
Wilson's face here and hopefully not run
 

497
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,350
Wilson's face here and hopefully not run
into anything and as far as how to wire

498
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,360
into anything and as far as how to wire
 

499
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,900
into anything and as far as how to wire
this we will it won't be super

500
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:43,910
this we will it won't be super
 

501
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,380
this we will it won't be super
complicated I think we just need like a

502
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,390
complicated I think we just need like a
 

503
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:53,800
complicated I think we just need like a
comparator on this side it infringes on

504
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:53,810
comparator on this side it infringes on
 

505
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,800
comparator on this side it infringes on
this one a little bit I hope like I

506
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:56,810
this one a little bit I hope like I
 

507
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,329
this one a little bit I hope like I
don't know what I'm putting here yet is

508
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:58,339
don't know what I'm putting here yet is
 

509
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,300
don't know what I'm putting here yet is
the problem okay we will just get rid of

510
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,310
the problem okay we will just get rid of
 

511
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,750
the problem okay we will just get rid of
this for now we're gonna do it so if the

512
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
this for now we're gonna do it so if the
 

513
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,610
this for now we're gonna do it so if the
signal goes to blocks then oops then

514
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,620
signal goes to blocks then oops then
 

515
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,199
signal goes to blocks then oops then
it's gonna tell this minecart to come

516
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:14,209
it's gonna tell this minecart to come
 

517
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,940
it's gonna tell this minecart to come
pick up whatever is in the hopper and

518
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:15,950
pick up whatever is in the hopper and
 

519
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,260
pick up whatever is in the hopper and
it's gonna pick up one item so run this

520
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,270
it's gonna pick up one item so run this
 

521
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,900
it's gonna pick up one item so run this
down like this and a repeater carry the

522
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:25,910
down like this and a repeater carry the
 

523
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,940
down like this and a repeater carry the
signal further and that is going to

524
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,950
signal further and that is going to
 

525
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,829
signal further and that is going to
power this track which will make the

526
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:32,839
power this track which will make the
 

527
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:43,449
power this track which will make the
minecart move do this and that I think

528
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:43,459
minecart move do this and that I think
 

529
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,030
minecart move do this and that I think
that'll work

530
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
that'll work
 

531
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,000
that'll work
and then we just need to power this okay

532
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,010
and then we just need to power this okay
 

533
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:58,510
and then we just need to power this okay
that's everything right let's try it out

534
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:58,520
that's everything right let's try it out
 

535
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,490
that's everything right let's try it out
a little put cobblestone in here so it

536
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:03,500
a little put cobblestone in here so it
 

537
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,800
a little put cobblestone in here so it
should be fine up to 22 items signal

538
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:08,810
should be fine up to 22 items signal
 

539
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,540
should be fine up to 22 items signal
only goes one block and then if we put

540
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,550
only goes one block and then if we put
 

541
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,050
only goes one block and then if we put
one more in excellent but it picked up

542
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,060
one more in excellent but it picked up
 

543
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,760
one more in excellent but it picked up
two items that's the problem

544
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:18,770
two items that's the problem
 

545
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,480
two items that's the problem
now we'll have to we'll have to change

546
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
now we'll have to we'll have to change
 

547
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,970
now we'll have to we'll have to change
this just a little bit so it doesn't do

548
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:24,980
this just a little bit so it doesn't do
 

549
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,660
this just a little bit so it doesn't do
that oops although this looks like the

550
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:31,670
that oops although this looks like the
 

551
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,610
that oops although this looks like the
same setup I had before I guess maybe

552
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:33,620
same setup I had before I guess maybe
 

553
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,400
same setup I had before I guess maybe
just I did raise the track on the other

554
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,410
just I did raise the track on the other
 

555
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,380
just I did raise the track on the other
one like I made it come up like that

556
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,390
one like I made it come up like that
 

557
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:46,300
one like I made it come up like that
maybe that's that's the difference and I

558
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,310
maybe that's that's the difference and I
 

559
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,130
maybe that's that's the difference and I
kind of need this to be just two blocks

560
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,140
kind of need this to be just two blocks
 

561
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,930
kind of need this to be just two blocks
wide so we can tile four of these

562
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:49,940
wide so we can tile four of these
 

563
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,750
wide so we can tile four of these
together I saw we got a big slime coming

564
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:55,760
together I saw we got a big slime coming
 

565
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,430
together I saw we got a big slime coming
here I'm just curious like this is still

566
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
here I'm just curious like this is still
 

567
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:08,439
here I'm just curious like this is still
working he comes and be a sucker

568
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:08,449
working he comes and be a sucker
 

569
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,150
working he comes and be a sucker
hahaha as a lot of well what's making

570
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,160
hahaha as a lot of well what's making
 

571
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,569
hahaha as a lot of well what's making
all the particle effects I was weird I

572
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:16,579
all the particle effects I was weird I
 

573
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,160
all the particle effects I was weird I
think I'm gonna have to downgrade my

574
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,170
think I'm gonna have to downgrade my
 

575
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,250
think I'm gonna have to downgrade my
snapshot this one's not running so good

only getting 24 frames at the moment and

578
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:24,620
only getting 24 frames at the moment and
 

579
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,420
only getting 24 frames at the moment and
I did switch to minimal or minimum

580
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,430
I did switch to minimal or minimum
 

581
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,640
I did switch to minimal or minimum
smooth lighting some people are telling

582
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,650
smooth lighting some people are telling
 

583
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,110
smooth lighting some people are telling
me it's the same as like what was it the

584
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
me it's the same as like what was it the
 

585
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,720
me it's the same as like what was it the
o4a works good for me but like beyond

586
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,730
o4a works good for me but like beyond
 

587
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,330
o4a works good for me but like beyond
that the frame rates pretty crummy and I

588
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,340
that the frame rates pretty crummy and I
 

589
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,710
that the frame rates pretty crummy and I
I heard that minimum is the same as the

590
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
I heard that minimum is the same as the
 

591
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I heard that minimum is the same as the
404 a but I don't think it is

592
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:46,730
404 a but I don't think it is
 

593
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,340
404 a but I don't think it is
I don't think it runs as well but yeah

594
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,350
I don't think it runs as well but yeah
 

595
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,730
I don't think it runs as well but yeah
this is it we got it this is all of this

596
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:54,740
this is it we got it this is all of this
 

597
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,910
this is it we got it this is all of this
here is just to detect what food we'd

598
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:57,920
here is just to detect what food we'd
 

599
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,090
here is just to detect what food we'd
give Wilson it doesn't actually do

600
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,100
give Wilson it doesn't actually do
 

601
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,770
give Wilson it doesn't actually do
anything yet we have to connect wires

602
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:02,780
anything yet we have to connect wires
 

603
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,140
anything yet we have to connect wires
from each of these now

604
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,150
from each of these now
 

605
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,299
from each of these now
and connect them to the different

606
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,309
and connect them to the different
 

607
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,450
and connect them to the different
variables to cause whatever we want to

608
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:10,460
variables to cause whatever we want to
 

609
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,480
variables to cause whatever we want to
happen and that's where things get more

610
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,490
happen and that's where things get more
 

611
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,200
happen and that's where things get more
tricky so this I'm scared to make it any

612
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,210
tricky so this I'm scared to make it any
 

613
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,760
tricky so this I'm scared to make it any
more complicated than this because this

614
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:18,770
more complicated than this because this
 

615
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,960
more complicated than this because this
is just gonna be a huge amount wiring

616
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:22,970
is just gonna be a huge amount wiring
 

617
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,630
is just gonna be a huge amount wiring
from this from these like three or four

618
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:25,640
from this from these like three or four
 

619
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,660
from this from these like three or four
different options alone but what we're

620
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:28,670
different options alone but what we're
 

621
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,920
different options alone but what we're
gonna do I think is is a main meal or

622
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:32,930
gonna do I think is is a main meal or
 

623
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,160
gonna do I think is is a main meal or
food of choice is gonna be steak so we

624
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,170
food of choice is gonna be steak so we
 

625
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:43,210
food of choice is gonna be steak so we
can get that ready for steak okay so if

626
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,220
can get that ready for steak okay so if
 

627
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,110
can get that ready for steak okay so if
we throw in one more if we feed them

628
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120

 

629
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,590

there we go

630
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:50,600
there we go
 

631
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,669
there we go
so should always just pick up one pretty

632
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:54,679
so should always just pick up one pretty
 

633
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:03,460
so should always just pick up one pretty
sure yeah well I just even if it does

634
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,470
sure yeah well I just even if it does
 

635
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,840
sure yeah well I just even if it does
pick up two it doesn't matter

636
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:04,850
pick up two it doesn't matter
 

637
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,549
pick up two it doesn't matter
oh no yeah it doesn't matter nevermind

638
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
oh no yeah it doesn't matter nevermind
 

639
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,840
oh no yeah it doesn't matter nevermind
damn it

640
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:07,850
damn it
 

641
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,690
damn it
I had to like alternate these a little

642
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:10,700
I had to like alternate these a little
 

643
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,520
I had to like alternate these a little
bit they're not exact copies of each

644
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:12,530
bit they're not exact copies of each
 

645
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,650
bit they're not exact copies of each
other just because the way the wiring

646
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:14,660
other just because the way the wiring
 

647
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,510
other just because the way the wiring
worked out but you can see the wire

648
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:16,520
worked out but you can see the wire
 

649
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,640
worked out but you can see the wire
travels two blocks then it gets to a

650
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:18,650
travels two blocks then it gets to a
 

651
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,710
travels two blocks then it gets to a
repeater set at two and then it goes to

652
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
repeater set at two and then it goes to
 

653
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,440
repeater set at two and then it goes to
the power rail if I if I did that in

654
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,450
the power rail if I if I did that in
 

655
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,640
the power rail if I if I did that in
between two of these power rails one one

656
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:30,650
between two of these power rails one one
 

657
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,380
between two of these power rails one one
wire would activate both of them so I

658
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:32,390
wire would activate both of them so I
 

659
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,000
wire would activate both of them so I
kind of had to separate them so like

660
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,010
kind of had to separate them so like
 

661
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,799
kind of had to separate them so like
this wire for example it doesn't power

662
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:38,809
this wire for example it doesn't power
 

663
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,980
this wire for example it doesn't power
this one at all it goes up here and then

664
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:41,990
this one at all it goes up here and then
 

665
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,850
this one at all it goes up here and then
powers it that way this one powers its

666
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:44,860
powers it that way this one powers its
 

667
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,960
powers it that way this one powers its
to the right here from that block and so

668
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:49,970
to the right here from that block and so
 

669
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,680
to the right here from that block and so
on and so forth so what we're gonna do

670
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:52,690
on and so forth so what we're gonna do
 

671
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,010
on and so forth so what we're gonna do
cookies

672
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,020
cookies
 

673
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,169
cookies
I'm gonna make this snack of choice

674
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:56,179
I'm gonna make this snack of choice
 

675
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,930
I'm gonna make this snack of choice
could you seem like a good snack for

676
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:58,940
could you seem like a good snack for
 

677
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,380
could you seem like a good snack for
Wilson so how do you do it yeah oh and

678
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,390
Wilson so how do you do it yeah oh and
 

679
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,039
Wilson so how do you do it yeah oh and
they're cheap look at that

680
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,049
they're cheap look at that
 

681
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,810
they're cheap look at that
so these will recover is how here are

682
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:06,820
so these will recover is how here are
 

683
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,600
so these will recover is how here are
little bits they'll add quite a bit to

684
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,610
little bits they'll add quite a bit to
 

685
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,799
little bits they'll add quite a bit to
weights and then also add to happiness a

686
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:16,809
weights and then also add to happiness a
 

687
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,669
weights and then also add to happiness a
bit as well

688
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679

 

689
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,289

okay so we'll give them cookies verses

690
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:22,299
okay so we'll give them cookies verses
 

691
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:28,590
okay so we'll give them cookies verses
second one here and again if this gets

692
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:28,600
second one here and again if this gets
 

693
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,250
second one here and again if this gets
beyond 22 my hair will come and pick it

694
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,260
beyond 22 my hair will come and pick it
 

695
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,410
beyond 22 my hair will come and pick it
up and then like all the stuff I feed

696
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,420
up and then like all the stuff I feed
 

697
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,120
up and then like all the stuff I feed
them will get stored in these chests and

698
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,130
them will get stored in these chests and
 

699
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,640
them will get stored in these chests and
it'll be cool like if he dies if our pet

700
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,650
it'll be cool like if he dies if our pet
 

701
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,590
it'll be cool like if he dies if our pet
dies we can come here afterwards and

702
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:40,600
dies we can come here afterwards and
 

703
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,270
dies we can come here afterwards and
just see how much we fed him over time

704
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,280
just see how much we fed him over time
 

705
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,240
just see how much we fed him over time
and kind of be like a stat report

706
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,250
and kind of be like a stat report
 

707
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,409
and kind of be like a stat report
afterwards said this one oh yeah this

708
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:49,419
afterwards said this one oh yeah this
 

709
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,200
afterwards said this one oh yeah this
one's for medicine if you get sick we

710
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,210
one's for medicine if you get sick we
 

711
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,180
one's for medicine if you get sick we
got to give them medicine and golden

712
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,190
got to give them medicine and golden
 

713
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,110
got to give them medicine and golden
apples are what I chose for that and I

714
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,120
apples are what I chose for that and I
 

715
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:07,409
apples are what I chose for that and I
made a bunch of them here medicine there

716
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:07,419
made a bunch of them here medicine there
 

717
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,980
made a bunch of them here medicine there
you go and finally this is like our junk

718
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:10,990
you go and finally this is like our junk
 

719
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,990
you go and finally this is like our junk
one like if we feed him anything that he

720
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,000
one like if we feed him anything that he
 

721
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,169
one like if we feed him anything that he
can't process oh why did it do that it

722
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:22,179
can't process oh why did it do that it
 

723
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,910
can't process oh why did it do that it
went on just one item

724
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:27,920

 

725
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,369

that was weird

726
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:32,379

 

727
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,779

did I put the full stack in maybe I did

728
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:34,789
did I put the full stack in maybe I did
 

729
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:40,889
did I put the full stack in maybe I did
that now I did yeah we'll just put a

730
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:40,899
that now I did yeah we'll just put a
 

731
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:46,989
that now I did yeah we'll just put a
stack of stuff there so if a junk item

732
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:46,999
stack of stuff there so if a junk item
 

733
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:49,439
stack of stuff there so if a junk item
goes into this one

734
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:49,449
goes into this one
 

735
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:53,589
goes into this one
like for example rotten flesh that

736
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:53,599
like for example rotten flesh that
 

737
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,669
like for example rotten flesh that
should always get pulled out of the

738
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:54,679
should always get pulled out of the
 

739
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,019
should always get pulled out of the
first slot these ones will never get

740
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:56,029
first slot these ones will never get
 

741
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,609
first slot these ones will never get
picked up and then there's there's

742
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:00,619
picked up and then there's there's
 

743
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,959
picked up and then there's there's
plenty of space in there for different

744
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:01,969
plenty of space in there for different
 

745
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:04,569
plenty of space in there for different
unique items so that'll be fine and then

746
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:04,579
unique items so that'll be fine and then
 

747
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,519
unique items so that'll be fine and then
what we're gonna do is we'll just run a

748
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:06,529
what we're gonna do is we'll just run a
 

749
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,959
what we're gonna do is we'll just run a
water stream above each of these hoppers

750
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:09,969
water stream above each of these hoppers
 

751
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:15,430
water stream above each of these hoppers
like so and be very careful not to let

752
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
like so and be very careful not to let
 

753
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,579
like so and be very careful not to let
the water pour into this wiring because

754
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:18,589
the water pour into this wiring because
 

755
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:28,029
the water pour into this wiring because
there's a lot here all right and that's

756
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:28,039
there's a lot here all right and that's
 

757
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,239
there's a lot here all right and that's
about it for the the food detection

758
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:31,249
about it for the the food detection
 

759
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,619
about it for the the food detection
system it's quite a bit to it actually

760
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:35,629
system it's quite a bit to it actually
 

761
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:38,439
system it's quite a bit to it actually
this is uh this is very simple part of

762
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:38,449
this is uh this is very simple part of
 

763
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:42,899
this is uh this is very simple part of
all this and it's it's pretty intricate

764
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:42,909
all this and it's it's pretty intricate
 

765
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:45,159
all this and it's it's pretty intricate
I'm a little worried doing the stuff

766
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:45,169
I'm a little worried doing the stuff
 

767
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,259
I'm a little worried doing the stuff
like before the redstone update finishes

768
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:47,269
like before the redstone update finishes
 

769
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,899
like before the redstone update finishes
because if just one one little thing

770
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:49,909
because if just one one little thing
 

771
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:52,739
because if just one one little thing
changes I might have to redo all this so

772
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:52,749
changes I might have to redo all this so
 

773
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:57,639
changes I might have to redo all this so
hopefully things are stable now okay and

774
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:57,649
hopefully things are stable now okay and
 

775
00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:58,479
hopefully things are stable now okay and
that's about it

776
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:58,489
that's about it
 

777
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,629
that's about it
let's put water in a hopper might be

778
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:01,639
let's put water in a hopper might be
 

779
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:03,489
let's put water in a hopper might be
nicer but it does make it more

780
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:03,499
nicer but it does make it more
 

781
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:09,939
nicer but it does make it more
complicated area and I would like no box

782
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:09,949
complicated area and I would like no box
 

783
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:12,369
complicated area and I would like no box
to play like for each like a different

784
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:12,379
to play like for each like a different
 

785
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:13,719
to play like for each like a different
tune for each different food we give

786
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:13,729
tune for each different food we give
 

787
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:20,379
tune for each different food we give
them it's actually a good thing I didn't

788
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:20,389
them it's actually a good thing I didn't
 

789
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,239
them it's actually a good thing I didn't
put the hopper right there at this first

790
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,249
put the hopper right there at this first
 

791
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,529
put the hopper right there at this first
block because maybe I would be able to

792
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:23,539
block because maybe I would be able to
 

793
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,319
block because maybe I would be able to
throw it past it I don't think I can

794
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:26,329
throw it past it I don't think I can
 

795
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:28,089
throw it past it I don't think I can
with it at the second block which is

796
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:28,099
with it at the second block which is
 

797
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,689
with it at the second block which is
good and maybe we'll still be able to

798
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:31,699
good and maybe we'll still be able to
 

799
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:37,809
good and maybe we'll still be able to
use a slot somehow the wiring is like

800
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:37,819
use a slot somehow the wiring is like
 

801
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,149
use a slot somehow the wiring is like
right there though hopefully it's not a

also I want to show you this location
 

815
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,720
also I want to show you this location
this is where I've been thinking of

816
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:57,730
this is where I've been thinking of
 

817
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,690
this is where I've been thinking of
putting the library this area here it's

818
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:00,700
putting the library this area here it's
 

819
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,509
putting the library this area here it's
close to the man cave that's the beacon

820
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:03,519
close to the man cave that's the beacon
 

821
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,700
close to the man cave that's the beacon
for the man cave right there so it's

822
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:05,710
for the man cave right there so it's
 

823
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,769
for the man cave right there so it's
it's really not that far away and we got

824
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:07,779
it's really not that far away and we got
 

825
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,620
it's really not that far away and we got
this awesome mountain area here and

826
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:10,630
this awesome mountain area here and
 

827
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,549
this awesome mountain area here and
actually this spawner this one here this

828
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
actually this spawner this one here this
 

829
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,680
actually this spawner this one here this
is the one we found in the very first

830
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:16,690
is the one we found in the very first
 

831
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,960
is the one we found in the very first
episode in this world it took me a long

832
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:18,970
episode in this world it took me a long
 

833
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,330
episode in this world it took me a long
time to find this again but it's it's

834
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:21,340
time to find this again but it's it's
 

835
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,519
time to find this again but it's it's
like right here but you got kind of what

836
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:26,529
like right here but you got kind of what
 

837
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,509
like right here but you got kind of what
is this have I I was this one these

838

overhang there we could maybe build on
 

843
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,700

845
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,279
or let's just go up here we don't need
anything huge for the library although

846
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,289
anything huge for the library although
 

847
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,480
anything huge for the library although
there's no reason we can't build

848
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,490
there's no reason we can't build
 

849
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,399

anything huge either like this is a nice
 

851
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:52,049
anything huge either like this is a nice

852
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:52,059
flat spot if we want to build something
 

853
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,389

place a hopper underneath the first if
 

953
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,470
place a hopper underneath the first if
you apply redstone signal to the

954
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:21,480
you apply redstone signal to the
 

955
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,030
you apply redstone signal to the
underneath hopper the above hopper will

956
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,040
underneath hopper the above hopper will
 

957
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,910
underneath hopper the above hopper will
collect items but hold its inventory if

958
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:25,920
collect items but hold its inventory if
 

959
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,020
collect items but hold its inventory if
if it's if it there is no power if there

960
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,030
if it's if it there is no power if there
 

961
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,420
if it's if it there is no power if there
is no power the above hopper will output

962
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,430
is no power the above hopper will output
 

963
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,730
is no power the above hopper will output
items to the underneath hopper that's

964
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:34,740
items to the underneath hopper that's
 

965
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,320
items to the underneath hopper that's
actually a really good suggestion so

966
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,330
actually a really good suggestion so
 

967
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,380
actually a really good suggestion so
like today with those mine carts that's

968
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,390
like today with those mine carts that's
 

969
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,390
like today with those mine carts that's
basically what I was doing or trying to

970
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,400
basically what I was doing or trying to
 

971
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,160
basically what I was doing or trying to
do but you can also do that with hoppers

972
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,170
do but you can also do that with hoppers
 

973
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,140
do but you can also do that with hoppers
alone without eating a minecart and

974
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,150
alone without eating a minecart and
 

975
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,210
alone without eating a minecart and
that's what he's telling me here you do

976
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,220
that's what he's telling me here you do
 

977
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,350
that's what he's telling me here you do
it like like this have it sideways so

978
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
it like like this have it sideways so
 

979
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,150
it like like this have it sideways so
it's not pointing into the hopper and

980
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,160
it's not pointing into the hopper and
 

981
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,510
it's not pointing into the hopper and
then if you power this bottom one like

982
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
then if you power this bottom one like
 

983
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,590
then if you power this bottom one like
so and then you put an item on top

984
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:04,600
so and then you put an item on top
 

985
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,360
so and then you put an item on top
it can still go into that hopper but it

986
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,370
it can still go into that hopper but it
 

987
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,640
it can still go into that hopper but it
won't go it won't pass through the

988
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:09,650
won't go it won't pass through the
 

989
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,340
won't go it won't pass through the
system this one holds it until you let

990
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,350
system this one holds it until you let
 

991
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,230
system this one holds it until you let
it through so that's that's definitely

992
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
it through so that's that's definitely
 

993
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,050
it through so that's that's definitely
another good way of doing it and it's a

994
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,060
another good way of doing it and it's a
 

995
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,130
another good way of doing it and it's a
good thing to keep in mind if if you

996
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,140
good thing to keep in mind if if you
 

997
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,540
good thing to keep in mind if if you
need that need to figure out that

998
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,550
need that need to figure out that
 

999
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,120
need that need to figure out that
situation that the minecarts do work for

1000
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,130
situation that the minecarts do work for
 

1001
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,380
situation that the minecarts do work for
good for what I'm doing because I need

1002
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,390
good for what I'm doing because I need
 

1003
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,890
good for what I'm doing because I need
the inventory space but for other things

1004
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:29,900
the inventory space but for other things
 

1005
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,370
the inventory space but for other things
the hopper method might be better but

1006
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:33,380
the hopper method might be better but
 

1007
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,250
the hopper method might be better but
yeah that's all for today guys have a

1008
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,260
yeah that's all for today guys have a
 

1009
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,650
yeah that's all for today guys have a
good day
