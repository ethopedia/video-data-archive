I I took a day off which is not
 

17
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,849
I I took a day off which is not
something I do too often and it just

18
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:28,859
something I do too often and it just
 

19
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,700
something I do too often and it just
felt so good that I took another one on

20
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:31,710
felt so good that I took another one on
 

21
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,389
felt so good that I took another one on
off and then when I went to record

22
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
off and then when I went to record
 

23
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,940
off and then when I went to record
finally my headset broke and I took

24
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:37,950
finally my headset broke and I took
 

25
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,000
finally my headset broke and I took
another day off in it's been spiraling

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,010
another day off in it's been spiraling
 

27
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,250
another day off in it's been spiraling
out of control so I'm back don't you

28
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,260
out of control so I'm back don't you
 

29
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,220
out of control so I'm back don't you
worry I'm back here I managed to take my

30
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,230
worry I'm back here I managed to take my
 

31
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,529
worry I'm back here I managed to take my
headset back together and hot glued it

32
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:48,539
headset back together and hot glued it
 

33
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,950
headset back together and hot glued it
together so it works again and I will be

34
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
together so it works again and I will be
 

35
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,200
together so it works again and I will be
getting a new mic soon to replace it

36
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,210
getting a new mic soon to replace it
 

37
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,520
getting a new mic soon to replace it
because it's going to break again

38
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,530
because it's going to break again
 

39
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,760
because it's going to break again
probably but don't you worry guys I am

40
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:58,770
probably but don't you worry guys I am
 

41
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,630
probably but don't you worry guys I am
back and I have not been doing totally

42
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
back and I have not been doing totally
 

43
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,700
back and I have not been doing totally
nothing here I have been building stuff

44
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,710
nothing here I have been building stuff
 

45
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,700
nothing here I have been building stuff
in our worlds most notably I've been

46
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,710
in our worlds most notably I've been
 

47
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,710
in our worlds most notably I've been
working on the Nexus so let me just show

48
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:09,720
working on the Nexus so let me just show
 

49
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,080
working on the Nexus so let me just show
you what I've been doing it's

50
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,090
you what I've been doing it's
 

51
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,330
you what I've been doing it's
unfortunately it's nothing very exciting

52
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:14,340
unfortunately it's nothing very exciting
 

53
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,210
unfortunately it's nothing very exciting
you know we have all these little grindy

54
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,220
you know we have all these little grindy
 

55
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,920
you know we have all these little grindy
projects to do around our world and I

56
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:18,930
projects to do around our world and I
 

57
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,380
projects to do around our world and I
know they don't make for great video so

58
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,390
know they don't make for great video so
 

59
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,810
know they don't make for great video so
I've been like pushing to get this stuff

60
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:23,820
I've been like pushing to get this stuff
 

61
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,570
I've been like pushing to get this stuff
done off camera so I had to run all the

62
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,580
done off camera so I had to run all the
 

63
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,450
done off camera so I had to run all the
wiring to the Nexus and it's just about

64
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,460
wiring to the Nexus and it's just about
 

65
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,870
wiring to the Nexus and it's just about
all done this wasn't here last time if

66
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
all done this wasn't here last time if
 

67
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,060
all done this wasn't here last time if
you look at our days you remember like

68
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,070
you look at our days you remember like
 

69
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,670
you look at our days you remember like
two episodes ago we were on day 6,000 we

70
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
two episodes ago we were on day 6,000 we
 

71
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,530
two episodes ago we were on day 6,000 we
just hit day 6000 we are on day 6000 129

72
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
just hit day 6000 we are on day 6000 129
 

73
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,800
just hit day 6000 we are on day 6000 129
now I have spent an insane amount of

74
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:45,810
now I have spent an insane amount of
 

75
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,080
now I have spent an insane amount of
time 129 days in the last two episodes

76
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,090
time 129 days in the last two episodes
 

77
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,310
time 129 days in the last two episodes
just doing this kind of stuff let me

78
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
just doing this kind of stuff let me
 

79
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,050
just doing this kind of stuff let me
show you though how this all works now

80
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,060
show you though how this all works now
 

81
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,969
show you though how this all works now
we can actually visualize it which is

82
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:55,979
we can actually visualize it which is
 

83
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,030
we can actually visualize it which is
pretty cool oh I don't have any redstone

84
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
pretty cool oh I don't have any redstone
 

85
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,649
pretty cool oh I don't have any redstone
on me here let's just use a lever I

86
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
on me here let's just use a lever I
 

87
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,219
on me here let's just use a lever I
guess so you can see here how this kind

88
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:04,229
guess so you can see here how this kind
 

89
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,469
guess so you can see here how this kind
of works now so if we send a signal to

90
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
of works now so if we send a signal to
 

91
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,419
of works now so if we send a signal to
this and we're not going to spend too

92
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,429
this and we're not going to spend too
 

93
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,619
this and we're not going to spend too
long on this I just want to show you

94
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:09,629
long on this I just want to show you
 

95
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,500
long on this I just want to show you
real quick because the block is over

96
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,510
real quick because the block is over
 

97
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,770
real quick because the block is over
here the signal goes

98
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:13,780
here the signal goes
 

99
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,140
here the signal goes
right if the piston was extended and the

100
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,150
right if the piston was extended and the
 

101
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,110
right if the piston was extended and the
block was over here let's break that

102
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
block was over here let's break that
 

103
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,070
block was over here let's break that
torch the signal will go to the left and

104
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
torch the signal will go to the left and
 

105
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,330
torch the signal will go to the left and
basically is a junction right it

106
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:24,340
basically is a junction right it
 

107
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,010
basically is a junction right it
switches between either the left or the

108
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,020
switches between either the left or the
 

109
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,080
switches between either the left or the
right and this is what I'm referring to

110
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,090
right and this is what I'm referring to
 

111
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,920
right and this is what I'm referring to
as the bits there's eight bits total so

112
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:31,930
as the bits there's eight bits total so
 

113
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,840
as the bits there's eight bits total so
it goes through eight of these junctions

114
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:33,850
it goes through eight of these junctions
 

115
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,720
it goes through eight of these junctions
so if we follow the signal here goes to

116
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:36,730
so if we follow the signal here goes to
 

117
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,770
so if we follow the signal here goes to
the right then it goes to another

118
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:37,780
the right then it goes to another
 

119
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,920
the right then it goes to another
Junction and it goes through there and

120
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:40,930
Junction and it goes through there and
 

121
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,080
Junction and it goes through there and
again we hit another Junction it kind of

122
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,090
again we hit another Junction it kind of
 

123
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,080
again we hit another Junction it kind of
does split hairs all the way down and

124
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,090
does split hairs all the way down and
 

125
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,440
does split hairs all the way down and
finally it gets to one of these droppers

126
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,450
finally it gets to one of these droppers
 

127
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,650
finally it gets to one of these droppers
just one of them depending on what code

128
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:52,660
just one of them depending on what code
 

129
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,270
just one of them depending on what code
we enter into that keypad up there so

130
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,280
we enter into that keypad up there so
 

131
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,740
we enter into that keypad up there so
it's going to select whichever dropper

132
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:58,750
it's going to select whichever dropper
 

133
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,010
it's going to select whichever dropper
we put put the code in for and every

134
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,020
we put put the code in for and every
 

135
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,650
we put put the code in for and every
time we send it a pulse the dropper gets

136
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:04,660
time we send it a pulse the dropper gets
 

137
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,290
time we send it a pulse the dropper gets
a pulse shoots the item up to the water

138
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:07,300
a pulse shoots the item up to the water
 

139
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,540
a pulse shoots the item up to the water
stream here and then the water stream is

140
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,550
stream here and then the water stream is
 

141
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,520
stream here and then the water stream is
going to deliver it to us at the front

142
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,530
going to deliver it to us at the front
 

143
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,070
going to deliver it to us at the front
of the Nexus uh-huh

144
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
of the Nexus uh-huh
 

145
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,990
of the Nexus uh-huh
so that's that's kind of how it's all

146
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
so that's that's kind of how it's all
 

147
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so that's that's kind of how it's all
working and it's so stinking close to

148
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,010
working and it's so stinking close to
 

149
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,640
working and it's so stinking close to
done I tell you guys I really wanted to

150
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,650
done I tell you guys I really wanted to
 

151
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,370
done I tell you guys I really wanted to
just push and finish it all but still

152
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:23,380
just push and finish it all but still
 

153
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,979
just push and finish it all but still
got a little left to do but I did wire

154
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:25,989
got a little left to do but I did wire
 

155
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,910
got a little left to do but I did wire
up the darn it I did wire up the

156
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
up the darn it I did wire up the
 

157
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,729
up the darn it I did wire up the
upstairs here too so you got all these

158
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:32,739
upstairs here too so you got all these
 

159

this
nether brick okay so these are four

274
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,370

I think the nether brick makes the most
 

283
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,219
I think the nether brick makes the most
sense here because we've used it already

284
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:34,229
sense here because we've used it already
 

285
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,870
sense here because we've used it already
but I like the low profile of

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:37,880
but I like the low profile of
 

287
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,110
but I like the low profile of
the carpet so this is actually kind of

288
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,120
the carpet so this is actually kind of
 

289
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,690
the carpet so this is actually kind of

00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:31,199
should we do this let's do like this I
 

475
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,559
should we do this let's do like this I
guess

476
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:32,569
guess
 

477
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,850
guess
yeah just a little bit of storage a

478
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:34,860
yeah just a little bit of storage a
 

479
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,410
yeah just a little bit of storage a
little area near the portal that will

480
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:36,420
little area near the portal that will
 

481
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,809
little area near the portal that will
hold a buffer of stuff and then let's

482
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:41,819
hold a buffer of stuff and then let's
 

483
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,900
hold a buffer of stuff and then let's
grab some hoppers just run a chain down

484
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:44,910
grab some hoppers just run a chain down
 

485
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,199
grab some hoppers just run a chain down
the side nothing too complicated just

486
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:47,209
the side nothing too complicated just
 

487
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,289
the side nothing too complicated just
like this and that'll be our basic deal

488
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:51,299
like this and that'll be our basic deal
 

489
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,269
like this and that'll be our basic deal
and then I want what I wanted to try was

490
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
and then I want what I wanted to try was
 

491
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,859
and then I want what I wanted to try was
maybe run a nice pass yeah okay so check

492
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:57,869
maybe run a nice pass yeah okay so check
 

493
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,119
maybe run a nice pass yeah okay so check
this out guys we're just gonna do it

494
00:11:59,119 --> 00:11:59,129
this out guys we're just gonna do it
 

495
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,939
this out guys we're just gonna do it
like this I ran a water path or nice

496
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:01,949
like this I ran a water path or nice
 

497
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,100
like this I ran a water path or nice
path whatever you call it all the way to

498
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,110
path whatever you call it all the way to
 

499
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,720
path whatever you call it all the way to
over here this is where I've been doing

500
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:05,730
over here this is where I've been doing
 

501
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,739
over here this is where I've been doing
our mining

502
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:06,749
our mining
 

503
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:09,139
our mining
reiben eating the sandstone and the sand

504
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:09,149
reiben eating the sandstone and the sand
 

505
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,669
reiben eating the sandstone and the sand
and all that good stuff oh I fell

506
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:12,679
and all that good stuff oh I fell
 

507
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,659
and all that good stuff oh I fell
usually what I do

508
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:14,669
usually what I do
 

509
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,049
usually what I do
I'll mine out a bunch of it to my

510
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:18,059
I'll mine out a bunch of it to my
 

511
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,699
I'll mine out a bunch of it to my
inventories fold and I have to head back

512
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:19,709
inventories fold and I have to head back
 

513
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,639
inventories fold and I have to head back
right now we have like a storage area up

514
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:22,649
right now we have like a storage area up
 

515
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:27,350
right now we have like a storage area up
by the portal and we don't have to go we

516
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
by the portal and we don't have to go we
 

517
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,879
by the portal and we don't have to go we
don't have to go there to drop stuff off

518
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:28,889
don't have to go there to drop stuff off
 

519
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,199
don't have to go there to drop stuff off
we can just throw it in the water stream

520
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:30,209
we can just throw it in the water stream
 

521
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,379
we can just throw it in the water stream
here and unload just kind of cool a

522
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:33,389
here and unload just kind of cool a
 

523
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,960
here and unload just kind of cool a
little bit simpler and then we just keep

524
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:35,970
little bit simpler and then we just keep
 

525
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,759
little bit simpler and then we just keep
on mining even though our inventory

526
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:37,769
on mining even though our inventory
 

527
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,999
on mining even though our inventory
filled up so I like that it's kind of

528
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:41,009
filled up so I like that it's kind of
 

529
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,949
filled up so I like that it's kind of
like what we did at the Mesa biome a

530
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
like what we did at the Mesa biome a
 

531
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,809
like what we did at the Mesa biome a
little while ago we set up that crazy

532
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:44,819
little while ago we set up that crazy
 

533
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:45,780
little while ago we set up that crazy
thing and set

534
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:45,790
thing and set
 

535
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,750
thing and set
way simpler it's just a water screen

536
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:48,760
way simpler it's just a water screen
 

537
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,260
way simpler it's just a water screen
just throw the stuff in and move on with

538
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,270
just throw the stuff in and move on with
 

539
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,410
just throw the stuff in and move on with
your life type of thing so the hoppers

540
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:55,420
your life type of thing so the hoppers
 

541
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,020
your life type of thing so the hoppers
will pick it up over here and then when

542
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,030
will pick it up over here and then when
 

543
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,850
will pick it up over here and then when
we're ready to leave all our duties

544
00:12:59,850 --> 00:12:59,860
we're ready to leave all our duties
 

545
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,430
we're ready to leave all our duties
should be in the chests they're nice and

546
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,440
should be in the chests they're nice and
 

547
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,370
should be in the chests they're nice and
simple and we got the minecarts tunnel

548
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,380
simple and we got the minecarts tunnel
 

549
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
simple and we got the minecarts tunnel
all set up so we can just fill up some

550
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,390
all set up so we can just fill up some
 

551
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,380
all set up so we can just fill up some
storage mine carts and we'll probably

552
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,390
storage mine carts and we'll probably
 

553
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,550
storage mine carts and we'll probably
set up so that we can push them through

554
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:11,560
set up so that we can push them through
 

555
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,220
set up so that we can push them through
the portal okay so I just move the

556
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,230
the portal okay so I just move the
 

557
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,990
the portal okay so I just move the
portal down here by the chest so it's a

558
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
portal down here by the chest so it's a
 

559
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,940
portal down here by the chest so it's a
little bit more convenient and what

560
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:17,950
little bit more convenient and what
 

561
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,460
little bit more convenient and what
we'll do got to change this out to a

562
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:20,470
we'll do got to change this out to a
 

563
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,990
we'll do got to change this out to a
dispenser I don't have one on me at the

564
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
dispenser I don't have one on me at the
 

565
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,240
dispenser I don't have one on me at the
moment but pretend it lands over here

566
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,250
moment but pretend it lands over here
 

567
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,020
moment but pretend it lands over here
and we can just unload our stuff

568
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,030
and we can just unload our stuff
 

569
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,900
and we can just unload our stuff
fill up the minecarts I have all this

570
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:30,910
fill up the minecarts I have all this
 

571
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,500
fill up the minecarts I have all this
garbage on me when I come here obviously

572
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,510
garbage on me when I come here obviously
 

573
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,470
garbage on me when I come here obviously
but we'll fill it up and then send it

574
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,480
but we'll fill it up and then send it
 

575
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,140
but we'll fill it up and then send it
off type of thing let's just double

576
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,150
off type of thing let's just double
 

577
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,420
off type of thing let's just double
check I did this right I slanted the

578
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,430
check I did this right I slanted the
 

579
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,830
check I did this right I slanted the
rail on the other side so hopefully

580
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:43,840
rail on the other side so hopefully
 

581
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,770
rail on the other side so hopefully
connected to that oh it didn't sand darn

582
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:46,780
connected to that oh it didn't sand darn
 

583
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,380
connected to that oh it didn't sand darn
it

584
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,390
it
 

585
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,060
it
all right it's very good we got that

586

all right it's very good we got that
 

587
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,010
all right it's very good we got that
working guys and we are going to move on

588
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,020
working guys and we are going to move on
 

589
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,040
working guys and we are going to move on
to another project here just trying to

590
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,050
to another project here just trying to
 

591
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,310
to another project here just trying to
add a border kitty-cats you you are a

592
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
add a border kitty-cats you you are a
 

593
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,830
add a border kitty-cats you you are a
problem you know what it is it's that

594
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:04,840
problem you know what it is it's that
 

595
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
problem you know what it is it's that
mob farm they keep teleporting out of my

596
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:06,730
mob farm they keep teleporting out of my
 

597
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,300
mob farm they keep teleporting out of my
mob farm and just randomly showing up

598
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,310
mob farm and just randomly showing up
 

599
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,560
mob farm and just randomly showing up
all over the place so I got all these

600
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,570
all over the place so I got all these
 

601
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,130

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:17,560
not sure what to do with them and they
 

605
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,510
not sure what to do with them and they
just sit there forever we might need to

606
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,520
just sit there forever we might need to
 

607
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,290
just sit there forever we might need to
make a home for all all our pets or

608
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,300
make a home for all all our pets or
 

609
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,100
make a home for all all our pets or
something I'm not sure

610
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,110
something I'm not sure
 

611
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,320
something I'm not sure
so from down here it looks like this

612
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,330
so from down here it looks like this
 

613
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:36,380
so from down here it looks like this
this is maybe a bit clunky yeah yeah I

614
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,390
this is maybe a bit clunky yeah yeah I
 

615
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,770
this is maybe a bit clunky yeah yeah I
don't know it's not a lot of room to

616
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:40,780
don't know it's not a lot of room to
 

617
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,580
don't know it's not a lot of room to
work with here

618
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,590
work with here
 

619
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,140
work with here
I just tried to add a little bend into

620
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,150
I just tried to add a little bend into
 

621
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,490
I just tried to add a little bend into
the path and then it goes over to this

622
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:44,500
the path and then it goes over to this
 

623
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,460
the path and then it goes over to this
area we worked on another day anyway

624
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,470
area we worked on another day anyway
 

625
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,140
area we worked on another day anyway
let's go down here what I really want to

626
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,150
let's go down here what I really want to
 

627
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,840
let's go down here what I really want to
work on is this fire workroom it's

628
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:51,850
work on is this fire workroom it's
 

629
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,600
work on is this fire workroom it's
pretty pretty plain pretty unpolished

630
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:54,610
pretty pretty plain pretty unpolished
 

631
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,550
pretty pretty plain pretty unpolished

feel like I put a lot of power into my
 

789
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,190
feel like I put a lot of power into my
voice but then when I hear it in a video

790
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
voice but then when I hear it in a video
 

791
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,470
voice but then when I hear it in a video
for example I feel very muffled like I

792
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
for example I feel very muffled like I
 

793
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,900
for example I feel very muffled like I
feel like I put a lot of you know

794
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:30,910
feel like I put a lot of you know
 

795
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,720
feel like I put a lot of you know
different emphasis and feeling and all

796
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:33,730
different emphasis and feeling and all
 

797
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,130
different emphasis and feeling and all
that into my voice and then it's like

798
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,140
that into my voice and then it's like
 

799
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,799
that into my voice and then it's like
this straight-up monotone type of thing

800
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:37,809
this straight-up monotone type of thing
 

801
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,470
this straight-up monotone type of thing
so it might just be me and I don't know

802
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
so it might just be me and I don't know
 

803
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,060
so it might just be me and I don't know
what I really sound like but I'm curious

804
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,070
what I really sound like but I'm curious
 

805
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,120
what I really sound like but I'm curious
if a new microphone will change that

806
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,130
if a new microphone will change that
 

807
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,310
if a new microphone will change that
like I think some people pick up

808
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,320
like I think some people pick up
 

809
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,070
like I think some people pick up
different in different microphones and I

810
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
different in different microphones and I
 

811
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,950
different in different microphones and I
might not have the best voice for my

812
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
might not have the best voice for my
 

813
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,590
might not have the best voice for my
current microphone it might be too deep

814
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
current microphone it might be too deep
 

815
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,150
current microphone it might be too deep
you know too deep and the microphone

816
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,160
you know too deep and the microphone
 

817
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,580
you know too deep and the microphone
doesn't pick up that range of of tone or

818
00:18:59,580 --> 00:18:59,590
doesn't pick up that range of of tone or
 

819
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,500
doesn't pick up that range of of tone or
whatever so yeah it should be

820
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,510
whatever so yeah it should be
 

821
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,539
whatever so yeah it should be
