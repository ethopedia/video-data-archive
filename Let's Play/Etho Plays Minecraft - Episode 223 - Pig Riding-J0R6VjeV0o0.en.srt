let's see if it works from the bottom

530
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
let's see if it works from the bottom
 

531
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,210
let's see if it works from the bottom
okay it looks hey it looks like it does

532
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:17,220
okay it looks hey it looks like it does
 

533
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,629
okay it looks hey it looks like it does
Wow and that's a good signal that my

534
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
Wow and that's a good signal that my
 

535
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,030
Wow and that's a good signal that my
fire is history on out

536
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
fire is history on out
 

537
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,439
fire is history on out
I gave this more thought though I

538
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:24,449
I gave this more thought though I
 

539
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,439
I gave this more thought though I
shouldn't really be blasting this maybe

540
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:26,449
shouldn't really be blasting this maybe
 

541
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:29,420
shouldn't really be blasting this maybe
not this part anyway I should be putting

542
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,430
not this part anyway I should be putting
 

543
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,269
not this part anyway I should be putting
down half slabs because it'll probably

544
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:32,279
down half slabs because it'll probably
 

545
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,850
down half slabs because it'll probably
be quicker than dumping lava all over

546
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:34,860
be quicker than dumping lava all over
 

547
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,960
be quicker than dumping lava all over
here I think so I'm just gonna try level

548
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:38,970
here I think so I'm just gonna try level
 

549
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:46,819
here I think so I'm just gonna try level
it out yeah my main focus with blasting

550
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:46,829
it out yeah my main focus with blasting
 

551
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,309
it out yeah my main focus with blasting
is going to be the overhangs I guess

552
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:49,319
is going to be the overhangs I guess
 

553
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,819
is going to be the overhangs I guess
like stuff like this just one second

636
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,050
where people derp around a lot and one
 

637
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,810
where people derp around a lot and one
of the things I'm most likes to do is

638
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:50,820
of the things I'm most likes to do is
 

639
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,330
of the things I'm most likes to do is
bring out the pigs with the saddles and

640
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:53,340
bring out the pigs with the saddles and
 

641
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,010
bring out the pigs with the saddles and
the the carrot sticks and have everybody

642

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,020
ride around with speed potions and stuff
 

645
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,520
ride around with speed potions and stuff
it's you get going really fast the thing

646
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,530
it's you get going really fast the thing
 

647
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,790
it's you get going really fast the thing
is we spawn areas the spawn areas are

648
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:07,800
is we spawn areas the spawn areas are
 

649
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,380
is we spawn areas the spawn areas are
always enclosed and I want to see what

650
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,390
always enclosed and I want to see what
 

651
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,000
always enclosed and I want to see what
it's like in an open world so I'm going

652
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,010
it's like in an open world so I'm going
 

653
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,590
it's like in an open world so I'm going
to make some carrots on a stick here I

654
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
to make some carrots on a stick here I
 

655
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,160
to make some carrots on a stick here I
got to farm some carrots first and then

656
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,170
got to farm some carrots first and then
 

657
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,570
got to farm some carrots first and then
we will go right a pig I'm kind of

658
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:23,580
we will go right a pig I'm kind of
 

659
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,250
we will go right a pig I'm kind of
curious about something with the carrots

660
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,260
curious about something with the carrots
 

661
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,340
curious about something with the carrots
like when you grow them it takes one

662
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,350
like when you grow them it takes one
 

663
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,300
like when you grow them it takes one
carrot as the seed and when you harvest

664
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,310
carrot as the seed and when you harvest
 

665
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:38,030
carrot as the seed and when you harvest
it you either get one let's see what you

666
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,040
it you either get one let's see what you
 

667
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,930
it you either get one let's see what you
get

668
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:40,940

 

669
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,270

that was too

670
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,280

 

671
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,410

- right I was at three it's so hard to

672
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:51,420
- right I was at three it's so hard to
 

673
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,660
- right I was at three it's so hard to
tell because stuff stack snap she look

674
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:53,670
tell because stuff stack snap she look
 

675
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,840
tell because stuff stack snap she look
at my bar better okay I'm at four eight

676
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:58,850
at my bar better okay I'm at four eight
 

677
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,000
at my bar better okay I'm at four eight
not eight four we got four that time

678
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,010
not eight four we got four that time
 

679
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:10,180
not eight four we got four that time
that's quite a bit reaiiy think yep

680
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,190

 

681
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,360

three again I'm just wondering how it

682
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,370
three again I'm just wondering how it
 

683
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,380
three again I'm just wondering how it
compares with wheat mostly okay so

684
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,390
compares with wheat mostly okay so
 

685
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,880
compares with wheat mostly okay so
here's another interest interesting

686
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:22,890
here's another interest interesting
 

687
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,480
here's another interest interesting
thing like when you use fortune on wheat

688
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,490
thing like when you use fortune on wheat
 

689
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,880
thing like when you use fortune on wheat
when you're harvesting wheat it does

690
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:28,890
when you're harvesting wheat it does
 

691
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,680
when you're harvesting wheat it does
work it gives you more seed so it

692
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:30,690
work it gives you more seed so it
 

693
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,090
work it gives you more seed so it
doesn't give you more wheat I'm

694
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,100
doesn't give you more wheat I'm
 

695
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,010
doesn't give you more wheat I'm
wondering if there that's different with

696
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,020
wondering if there that's different with
 

697
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:41,810
wondering if there that's different with
carrots it looks like it is okay we got

698
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:41,820
carrots it looks like it is okay we got
 

699
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,440
carrots it looks like it is okay we got
for that time which it is an axe I think

700
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,450
for that time which it is an axe I think
 

701
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,180
for that time which it is an axe I think
it could have been a coincidence 16 to

702
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,190
it could have been a coincidence 16 to
 

703
00:21:52,190 --> 00:22:00,550
it could have been a coincidence 16 to
24 again

704
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:00,560

 

705
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,610

that was five so yeah if you're using

706
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:06,620
that was five so yeah if you're using
 

707
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,980
that was five so yeah if you're using
fortune on this stuff it definitely gets

708
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:08,990
fortune on this stuff it definitely gets
 

709
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,200
fortune on this stuff it definitely gets
you better results and then using it on

710
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,210
you better results and then using it on
 

711
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:21,130
you better results and then using it on
wheat and interesting so I compared to

712
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,140
wheat and interesting so I compared to
 

713
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,100
wheat and interesting so I compared to
wheats I looked on the wiki the total

714
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,110
wheats I looked on the wiki the total
 

715
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,090
wheats I looked on the wiki the total
food value for wheat is 11 points and

716
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,100
food value for wheat is 11 points and
 

717
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,180
food value for wheat is 11 points and
the total food value for carrots is 8

718
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,190
the total food value for carrots is 8
 

719
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,590
the total food value for carrots is 8
point 8 and it takes 3 wheat to make it

720
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:34,600
point 8 and it takes 3 wheat to make it
 

721
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,340
point 8 and it takes 3 wheat to make it
wait what'd I say total food value for

722
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,350
wait what'd I say total food value for
 

723
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,670
wait what'd I say total food value for
bread is 11 points I think I said wheat

724
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:41,680
bread is 11 points I think I said wheat
 

725
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,470
bread is 11 points I think I said wheat
total food value for carrots is 8 point

726
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
total food value for carrots is 8 point
 

727
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,450
total food value for carrots is 8 point
8 so it takes 3 weeks to make bread so

728
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,460
8 so it takes 3 weeks to make bread so
 

729
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,000
8 so it takes 3 weeks to make bread so
you got to factor that in that's really

730
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,010
you got to factor that in that's really
 

731
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,280
you got to factor that in that's really
interesting but I think baked potatoes

732
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,290
interesting but I think baked potatoes
 

733
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,730
interesting but I think baked potatoes
are really good because they div I think

734
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:03,740
are really good because they div I think
 

735
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,680
are really good because they div I think
I can't remember what it was but they

736
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:05,690
I can't remember what it was but they
 

737
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,140
I can't remember what it was but they
give more food than wheat then bread

738
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,150
give more food than wheat then bread
 

739
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,680
give more food than wheat then bread
they did more food value than bread and

740
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:10,690
they did more food value than bread and
 

741
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,090
they did more food value than bread and
I'm sure you could use fortune on them

742
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm sure you could use fortune on them
 

743
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:22,210
I'm sure you could use fortune on them
as well anyway well I finally found a

744
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,220
as well anyway well I finally found a
 

745
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,730
as well anyway well I finally found a
piggy I don't have that many animals in

746
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:24,740
piggy I don't have that many animals in
 

747
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,430
piggy I don't have that many animals in
my world really like the grassland is

748
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
my world really like the grassland is
 

749
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,250
my world really like the grassland is
just barren they've all wandered off for

750
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,260
just barren they've all wandered off for
 

751
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,490
just barren they've all wandered off for
died no new ones are spawning because we

752
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:33,500
died no new ones are spawning because we
 

753
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,910
died no new ones are spawning because we
got sheep there

754
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:35,920
got sheep there
 

755
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,310
got sheep there

there's another one

758
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:42,980
there's another one
 

759
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,310
there's another one
just this is what you used to bring them

760
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,320
just this is what you used to bring them
 

761

763
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,840
yeah it is ok oh don't don't step there
piggy alright so to make one of these

764
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,850
piggy alright so to make one of these
 

765
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,390
piggy alright so to make one of these
things you just do it carrots on a

766
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,400
things you just do it carrots on a
 

767
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:03,180
things you just do it carrots on a
fishing rod do they follow this - yep ok

768
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,190
fishing rod do they follow this - yep ok
 

769
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,930
fishing rod do they follow this - yep ok
get a saddle just going to try to try

770
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:07,940
get a saddle just going to try to try
 

771
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,070

ride them first just the normal way so

772
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
ride them first just the normal way so
 

773
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,540
ride them first just the normal way so
you can direct which way they're going

774
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:13,550
you can direct which way they're going
 

775
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,259
you can direct which way they're going
with the

776
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:16,269

 

777
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:26,789

so see how how long is Excel time is

778
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799

 

779
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,509

you're not really moving that quick wait

780
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:31,519
you're not really moving that quick wait
 

781
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,039
you're not really moving that quick wait
wait I think he's picking up speed

782
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,049
wait I think he's picking up speed
 

783
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:38,459
wait I think he's picking up speed
maybe maybe not

784
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:38,469
maybe maybe not
 

785
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:41,109
maybe maybe not
okay so I'm going to try right-click get

786
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:41,119
okay so I'm going to try right-click get
 

787
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,779
okay so I'm going to try right-click get
a speed boost oh yeah you see how much

788
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:43,789
a speed boost oh yeah you see how much
 

789
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:52,509
a speed boost oh yeah you see how much
durability that used up go piggy yeah

790
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:52,519
durability that used up go piggy yeah
 

791
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,769
durability that used up go piggy yeah
he's moving quicker definitely moving

792
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:56,779
he's moving quicker definitely moving
 

793
00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:01,929
he's moving quicker definitely moving
quicker wonder how long he runs for

794
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:01,939
quicker wonder how long he runs for
 

795
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:07,989
quicker wonder how long he runs for
after you do that what happens if we do

796
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:07,999
after you do that what happens if we do
 

797
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,769
after you do that what happens if we do
it again oh we can

798
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:11,779
it again oh we can
 

799
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:16,149
it again oh we can
I won't let us actually you know what

800
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
I won't let us actually you know what
 

801
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:16,959
I won't let us actually you know what
we're going to do we're going to make

802
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:16,969
we're going to do we're going to make
 

803
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,959
we're going to do we're going to make
him go towards our beacon I think you

804
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:19,969
him go towards our beacon I think you
 

805
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:28,320
him go towards our beacon I think you
slowed down again there we go

806
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,330

 

807
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,380

they can go towards our beacon you did

808
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,390
they can go towards our beacon you did
 

809
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,419
they can go towards our beacon you did
it you did get going pretty good one if

810
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:34,429
it you did get going pretty good one if
 

811
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:35,529
it you did get going pretty good one if
you do a speed boost

812
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:35,539
you do a speed boost
 

813
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:42,850
you do a speed boost
oh how thanks let me use it oh okay

814
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:42,860
oh how thanks let me use it oh okay
 

815
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,130
oh how thanks let me use it oh okay
Oh make a new one it's too broken to use

816
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,140
Oh make a new one it's too broken to use
 

817
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,970
Oh make a new one it's too broken to use
it again I guess there we go yeah you

818
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:54,980
it again I guess there we go yeah you
 

819
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,549
it again I guess there we go yeah you
can only do one speed boost at a time it

820
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:57,559
can only do one speed boost at a time it
 

821
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,200
can only do one speed boost at a time it
seems to last for like fifteen seconds

822
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,210
seems to last for like fifteen seconds
 

823
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:07,480
seems to last for like fifteen seconds
or so alright I think we're in are we in

824
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,490
or so alright I think we're in are we in
 

825
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,580
or so alright I think we're in are we in
the speed boost area I wonder if he'll

826
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:09,590
the speed boost area I wonder if he'll
 

827
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,870
the speed boost area I wonder if he'll
be affected by the beach and even

828
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
be affected by the beach and even
 

829
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,799
be affected by the beach and even
actually might only be me should be

830
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:17,809
actually might only be me should be
 

831
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:24,149
actually might only be me should be
speed boost area yeah I'm speed boosted

832
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159

 

833
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,470

the terrain is so rough though it's hard

834
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
the terrain is so rough though it's hard
 

835
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,070
the terrain is so rough though it's hard
to tell oh they fall in the water you

836
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
to tell oh they fall in the water you
 

837
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:38,490
to tell oh they fall in the water you
lose all control I think

838
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:38,500

 

839
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,380

ya know particle effects over the PE a

840
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,390
ya know particle effects over the PE a
 

841
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,630
ya know particle effects over the PE a
lot today we're going to give him a

842
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
lot today we're going to give him a
 

843
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,260
lot today we're going to give him a
speed one he's got the particle effects

844
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,270
speed one he's got the particle effects
 

845
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,880
speed one he's got the particle effects
now we're going to see if they stack

846
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:56,890
now we're going to see if they stack
 

847
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,909
now we're going to see if they stack
together the carrot on the stick boosts

848
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
together the carrot on the stick boosts
 

849
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:07,590
together the carrot on the stick boosts
plus is speed boost should get moving

850
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
plus is speed boost should get moving
 

851
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:19,740
plus is speed boost should get moving
pretty quick if it does yeah we're going

852
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:19,750
pretty quick if it does yeah we're going
 

853
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:26,279
pretty quick if it does yeah we're going
pretty good here holy I think it does

854
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:26,289
pretty good here holy I think it does
 

855
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:33,930
pretty good here holy I think it does
stack really hard to control though like

856
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:33,940
stack really hard to control though like
 

857
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,240
stack really hard to control though like
if you got any obstacles in your way

858
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,250

 

859
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:46,260

especially water all right here he goes

860
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,270
especially water all right here he goes
 

861
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:55,140
especially water all right here he goes
here he goes ah oh he doesn't like the

862
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,150
here he goes ah oh he doesn't like the
 

863
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:09,600
here he goes ah oh he doesn't like the
lily pads that's for sure 19 you fix

864
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:09,610
lily pads that's for sure 19 you fix
 

865
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,390
lily pads that's for sure 19 you fix
these by oh good he can't otherwise

866
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:15,400
these by oh good he can't otherwise
 

867
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,799
these by oh good he can't otherwise
you're gonna have all these broken ones

868
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:16,809
you're gonna have all these broken ones
 

869
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,289
you're gonna have all these broken ones
left over that you can't speed boost

870
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:19,299
left over that you can't speed boost
 

871
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,020
left over that you can't speed boost
with

872
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,030

 

873
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,050

hey etho I was wondering if you could
show us your other worlds on your

884
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:39,710
show us your other worlds on your
 

885
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,070
show us your other worlds on your
minecraft accounts they must be pretty

886

ours because you don't do LPS on those
 

893
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,580
ours because you don't do LPS on those
worlds alright well I hope you see this

894

00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,430
there aren't really any worlds I pretty
 

899
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,100
there aren't really any worlds I pretty
much only play on my let's play world

900
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,110
much only play on my let's play world
 

901
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,870

that and then I have some creative
 

909
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,250
that and then I have some creative
worlds which are really disorganized and

910
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:15,260
worlds which are really disorganized and
 

911
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:21,610

older let's play worlds like three major
ones before this one two of those I did

916
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
ones before this one two of those I did
 

917
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,150
ones before this one two of those I did
before I start doing episodes back in

918
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,160
before I start doing episodes back in
 

919
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,490
before I start doing episodes back in
alpha days I've been tempted to look at

920
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:33,500
alpha days I've been tempted to look at
 

921
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
alpha days I've been tempted to look at
those again since it's been so long oh

922
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:35,510
those again since it's been so long oh
 

923
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:42,490
those again since it's been so long oh
man a leg oh it's bad it's like I'm

924
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:42,500
man a leg oh it's bad it's like I'm
 

925
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,970
man a leg oh it's bad it's like I'm
ripping through time as I run but yeah

926
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:45,980
ripping through time as I run but yeah
 

927
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,280
ripping through time as I run but yeah
maybe I'll comment on the J probably

928
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,290
maybe I'll comment on the J probably

I don't do something just because people
 

945
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,810
I don't do something just because people
tell me that's what I should do and also

tell me that's what I should do and also
 

947

like what projects I choose to do and
 

949
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,710
like what projects I choose to do and
and like sort of design I do that 100%

950
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
and like sort of design I do that 100%
