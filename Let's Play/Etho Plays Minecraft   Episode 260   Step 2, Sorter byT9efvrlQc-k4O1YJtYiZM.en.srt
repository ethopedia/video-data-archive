i am deeply and deeply concerned about
the changes with skeletons like they

12
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
the changes with skeletons like they
 

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,670
the changes with skeletons like they
they accounted for over half the deaths

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
they accounted for over half the deaths
 

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,630
they accounted for over half the deaths
before i believe

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
before i believe
 

17
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,630
before i believe

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
and now they are insanely skilled like
 

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,109
and now they are insanely skilled like
they

they
 

21
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,709
they
they got their rapid fire spamming and

22
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
they got their rapid fire spamming and
 

23
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,790
they got their rapid fire spamming and
all kinds of crazy stuff they get flame

24
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
all kinds of crazy stuff they get flame
 

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,750
all kinds of crazy stuff they get flame
bows now

26
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
bows now

and and thorn's armor and all sorts of
crazy crazy stuff um so

30
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
crazy crazy stuff um so
 

31
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,190
crazy crazy stuff um so
in future uhc seasons if and when they

32
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
in future uhc seasons if and when they
 

33
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,670
in future uhc seasons if and when they
happen

34
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
happen
 

35
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,670
happen
i don't know when they're gonna happen

36
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
i don't know when they're gonna happen
 

37
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,750
i don't know when they're gonna happen
so don't ask

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
so don't ask
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,389
so don't ask
but if another one happens i don't know

40
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
but if another one happens i don't know
 

41
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,750
but if another one happens i don't know
how it's gonna play out i think the

42
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
how it's gonna play out i think the
 

43
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,990
how it's gonna play out i think the
skeletons are gonna get most

44
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
skeletons are gonna get most
 

45
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,349
skeletons are gonna get most
of the kills i gotta say

46
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
of the kills i gotta say
 

47
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,549
of the kills i gotta say
because man these guys are

48
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
because man these guys are
 

49
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,670
because man these guys are
good um

50
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
good um
 

51
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,670
good um
this is a trick by the way this this is

52
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
this is a trick by the way this this is
 

53
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,990
this is a trick by the way this this is
actually a bug in 1.5 that i'm

54
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
actually a bug in 1.5 that i'm
 

55
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,830
actually a bug in 1.5 that i'm
exploiting for this intro and with that

56
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
exploiting for this intro and with that
 

57
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,350
exploiting for this intro and with that
let's get into the let's play

58
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360

 

59
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,590

so yeah here we are in the let's play

60
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
so yeah here we are in the let's play
 

61
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,550
so yeah here we are in the let's play
world

62
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
world
 

63
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,469
world
and we're going to be working on our mob

64
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
and we're going to be working on our mob
 

65
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,350
and we're going to be working on our mob
system today that's the plan

66
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
system today that's the plan
 

67
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,429
system today that's the plan
uh at least to start out with again and

68
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
uh at least to start out with again and
 

69
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,670
uh at least to start out with again and
i've had this big plan for the mob

70
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
i've had this big plan for the mob
 

71
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,510
i've had this big plan for the mob
system for a long time

72
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
system for a long time
 

73
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,270
system for a long time
the problem that happened last time is i

74
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
the problem that happened last time is i
 

75
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,950
the problem that happened last time is i
started building it and i kind of got it

76
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
started building it and i kind of got it
 

77
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,270
started building it and i kind of got it
to this point

78
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
to this point
 

79
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,389
to this point
and then i didn't really know what to do

80
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
and then i didn't really know what to do
 

81
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,910
and then i didn't really know what to do
with it so then i start building the

82
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
with it so then i start building the
 

83
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,510
with it so then i start building the
area around it and we

84
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
area around it and we
 

85
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,270
area around it and we
we sort of decide on the shape and the

86
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
we sort of decide on the shape and the
 

87
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,190
we sort of decide on the shape and the
emp units and all that

88
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
emp units and all that
 

89
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,190
emp units and all that
and then shortly after that i had

90
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
and then shortly after that i had
 

91
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,630
and then shortly after that i had
another idea

92
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
another idea
 

93
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,109
another idea
but it was too late we already sort of

94
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
but it was too late we already sort of
 

95
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,789
but it was too late we already sort of
settled on

96
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
settled on
 

97
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,190
settled on
the look of this place and i needed more

98
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
the look of this place and i needed more
 

99
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,990
the look of this place and i needed more
space to do what i wanted

100
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
space to do what i wanted
 

101
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,150
space to do what i wanted
but since we're redoing everything

102
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
but since we're redoing everything
 

103
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,389
but since we're redoing everything
it it doesn't really matter how big the

104
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
it it doesn't really matter how big the
 

105
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,510
it it doesn't really matter how big the
thing is i can

106
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
thing is i can
 

107
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,630
thing is i can
i can change the shape of everything

108
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
i can change the shape of everything
 

109
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,990
i can change the shape of everything
and make the mob system as big as i want

110
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
and make the mob system as big as i want
 

111
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,790
and make the mob system as big as i want
now so we have a lot of freedom and a

112
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
now so we have a lot of freedom and a
 

113
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,910
now so we have a lot of freedom and a
lot of this stuff is probably going to

114
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
lot of this stuff is probably going to
 

115
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,229
lot of this stuff is probably going to
get

116
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
get
 

117
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,830
get
ripped out and changed and that's fine

118
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
ripped out and changed and that's fine
 

119
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,350
ripped out and changed and that's fine
but yeah this is a five to seven

120
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
but yeah this is a five to seven
 

121
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,550
but yeah this is a five to seven
step project each step very complicated

122
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
step project each step very complicated
 

123
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,710
step project each step very complicated
uh what i want to do the first step we

124
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
uh what i want to do the first step we
 

125
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,869
uh what i want to do the first step we
already have done the mob system itself

126
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
already have done the mob system itself
 

127
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,229
already have done the mob system itself
the second step what we're going to be

128
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
the second step what we're going to be
 

129
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,070
the second step what we're going to be
working on today

130
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
working on today
 

131
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,070
working on today
is the mob sorter

132
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
is the mob sorter
 

133
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,390
is the mob sorter
and by the third step you'll know i'll

134
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
and by the third step you'll know i'll
 

135
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,910
and by the third step you'll know i'll
tell you what we're gonna do but i think

136
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
tell you what we're gonna do but i think
 

137
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,750
tell you what we're gonna do but i think
we'll just wait on that for

138
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
we'll just wait on that for
 

139
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,670
we'll just wait on that for
for the time being so we're gonna

140
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
for the time being so we're gonna
 

141
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,589
for the time being so we're gonna
hopefully get the mob sorter working

142
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
hopefully get the mob sorter working
 

143
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,309
hopefully get the mob sorter working
today i started here already i made a

144
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
today i started here already i made a
 

145
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,949
today i started here already i made a
proper junction that works finally up

146
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
proper junction that works finally up
 

147
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,790
proper junction that works finally up
here so

148
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
here so
 

149
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,390
here so
as is right now the mobs just fall

150
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
as is right now the mobs just fall
 

151
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,830
as is right now the mobs just fall
straight down

152
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
straight down
 

153
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,030
straight down
if i want to instant kill them and

154
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
if i want to instant kill them and
 

155
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,509
if i want to instant kill them and
if i want to get them into the mobs

156
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
if i want to get them into the mobs
 

157
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,149
if i want to get them into the mobs
order i can

158
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
order i can
 

159
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,070
order i can
flip a switch and it will make them fall

160
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
flip a switch and it will make them fall
 

161
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,070
flip a switch and it will make them fall
into a water stream

162
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
into a water stream
 

163
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,430
into a water stream
and push them to our mob sorter system

164
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
and push them to our mob sorter system
 

165
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,270
and push them to our mob sorter system
that we're about to build

166
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
that we're about to build
 

167
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,869
that we're about to build
so this what this lever does

168
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
so this what this lever does
 

169
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,910
so this what this lever does
is it there's a piston there that's

170
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
is it there's a piston there that's
 

171
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,509
is it there's a piston there that's
inverted

172
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
inverted
 

173
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,949
inverted
that opens and closes this

174
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
that opens and closes this
 

175
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,309
that opens and closes this
this uh downward falling area and allows

176
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
this uh downward falling area and allows
 

177
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,229
this uh downward falling area and allows
water to flow over top it

178
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
water to flow over top it
 

179
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,710
water to flow over top it
when it's when the block is there and

180
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
when it's when the block is there and
 

181
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,949
when it's when the block is there and
then there's these two pistons that

182
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
then there's these two pistons that
 

183
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,070
then there's these two pistons that
um release the water and also keep the

184
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
um release the water and also keep the
 

185
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,869
um release the water and also keep the
mobs from

186
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
mobs from
 

187
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,149
mobs from
going down this tunnel when we don't

188
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
going down this tunnel when we don't
 

189
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,990
going down this tunnel when we don't
want them to

190
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
want them to
 

191
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,509
want them to
because even if they're falling straight

192
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
because even if they're falling straight
 

193
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,509
because even if they're falling straight
down and this is open over here

194
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
down and this is open over here
 

195
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,470
down and this is open over here
they sometimes will get in there somehow

196
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480

 

197
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,070

so yeah let's get started here

198
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
so yeah let's get started here
 

199
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,310
so yeah let's get started here
so the way we're going to be separating

200
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
so the way we're going to be separating
 

201
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,310
so the way we're going to be separating
the mobs as you may have guessed

202
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
the mobs as you may have guessed
 

203
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,150
the mobs as you may have guessed
uh we're going to separate zombies out

204
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
uh we're going to separate zombies out
 

205
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,670
uh we're going to separate zombies out
using villagers and

206
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
using villagers and
 

207
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,469
using villagers and
creepers out using ocelots and then

208
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
creepers out using ocelots and then
 

209
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,310
creepers out using ocelots and then
skeletons we're going to separate

210
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
skeletons we're going to separate
 

211
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,590
skeletons we're going to separate
using time and let's just go inside here

212
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
using time and let's just go inside here
 

213
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,909
using time and let's just go inside here
oh that's a tricky fall right there okay

214
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
oh that's a tricky fall right there okay
 

215
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,430
oh that's a tricky fall right there okay
we should be safe to work in here while

216
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
we should be safe to work in here while
 

217
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,749
we should be safe to work in here while
they fall down i marked where the water

218
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
they fall down i marked where the water
 

219
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,790
they fall down i marked where the water
goes up to

220
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
goes up to
 

221
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,550
goes up to
up to here and i think we'll make it run

222
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
up to here and i think we'll make it run
 

223
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,790
up to here and i think we'll make it run
that full length

224
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
that full length
 

225
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,189
that full length
and have this area here as a sort of a

226
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
and have this area here as a sort of a
 

227
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,310
and have this area here as a sort of a
buffer so if

228
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
buffer so if
 

229
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,430
buffer so if
there's lots of mobs at one period of

230
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
there's lots of mobs at one period of
 

231
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,030
there's lots of mobs at one period of
time and then there's few mobs it'll

232
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
time and then there's few mobs it'll
 

233
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,830
time and then there's few mobs it'll
kind of bounce itself

234
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
kind of bounce itself
 

235
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,510
kind of bounce itself
out and then

236
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
out and then
 

237
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,710
out and then
we're gonna make them fall here and get

238
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
we're gonna make them fall here and get
 

239
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,350
we're gonna make them fall here and get
rid of this

240
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360

 

241
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,629

actually let's just go over there and

242
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
actually let's just go over there and
 

243
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,310
actually let's just go over there and
maybe tear it down

244
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
maybe tear it down
 

245
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,510
maybe tear it down
all right i got that ripped out over

246
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
all right i got that ripped out over
 

247
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,310
all right i got that ripped out over
there now we can work in that area

248
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
there now we can work in that area
 

249
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,990
there now we can work in that area
and i made some trapdoors we're going to

250
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
and i made some trapdoors we're going to
 

251
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,830
and i made some trapdoors we're going to
use those for

252
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
use those for
 

253
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,710
use those for
a date right here

254
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720

 

255
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,909

wait do we want it like that

256
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919

 

257
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,469

yeah that should be fine mobs will fall

258
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
yeah that should be fine mobs will fall
 

259
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,590
yeah that should be fine mobs will fall
down here

260
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
down here
 

261
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,230
down here
this will what this does it's gonna flip

262
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
this will what this does it's gonna flip
 

263
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,270
this will what this does it's gonna flip
like this

264
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
like this
 

265
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,310
like this
really quick and that'll only allow one

266
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
really quick and that'll only allow one
 

267
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,469
really quick and that'll only allow one
mob to get through at a time

268
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
mob to get through at a time
 

269
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,230
mob to get through at a time
i'm pretty sure because if they're if

270
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
i'm pretty sure because if they're if
 

271
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,590
i'm pretty sure because if they're if
they move forward a little bit they'll

272
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
they move forward a little bit they'll
 

273
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,189
they move forward a little bit they'll
be inside the trapdoor and then they can

274
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
be inside the trapdoor and then they can
 

275
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,590
be inside the trapdoor and then they can
keep

276
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
keep
 

277
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,230
keep
walking and fall or keep getting pushed

278
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
walking and fall or keep getting pushed
 

279
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,310
walking and fall or keep getting pushed
by the water currents

280
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
by the water currents
 

281
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,189
by the water currents
uh so they're gonna fall down here and

282
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
uh so they're gonna fall down here and
 

283
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,230
uh so they're gonna fall down here and
we'll control this with

284
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
we'll control this with
 

285
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,230
we'll control this with
redstone uh i have sort of

286
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
redstone uh i have sort of
 

287
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,790
redstone uh i have sort of
built this in creative already but i

288
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
built this in creative already but i
 

289
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,629
built this in creative already but i
just built like a rough copy we're gonna

290
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
just built like a rough copy we're gonna
 

291
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,469
just built like a rough copy we're gonna
have to figure out a few things

292
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
have to figure out a few things
 

293
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,469
have to figure out a few things
still with this and make some

294
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
still with this and make some
 

295
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,230
still with this and make some
adjustments i'm sure

296
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
adjustments i'm sure
 

297
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,629
adjustments i'm sure
i i i just made like a manual version

298
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
i i i just made like a manual version
 

299
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,350
i i i just made like a manual version
where i was

300
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
where i was
 

301
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,510
where i was
uh putting the mobs in and controlling

302
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
uh putting the mobs in and controlling
 

303
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,790
uh putting the mobs in and controlling
the doors and that

304
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
the doors and that
 

305
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,350
the doors and that
myself but we have to make it fully

306
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
myself but we have to make it fully
 

307
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,990
myself but we have to make it fully
automatic

308
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
automatic
 

309
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,590
automatic
but from what i could tell it seemed

310
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
but from what i could tell it seemed
 

311
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,790
but from what i could tell it seemed
like this was going to work i don't know

312
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
like this was going to work i don't know
 

313
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,870
like this was going to work i don't know
how accurate it's going to be either

314
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
how accurate it's going to be either
 

315
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,710
how accurate it's going to be either
as far as separating the mobs goes

316
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
as far as separating the mobs goes
 

317
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,309
as far as separating the mobs goes
okay mobs are going to fall

318
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319

 

319
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,550

see they need space for their heads so

320
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560

 

321
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,029

that's two blocks uh they'll have to go

322
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
that's two blocks uh they'll have to go
 

323
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,790
that's two blocks uh they'll have to go
one more down probably so right there

324
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
one more down probably so right there
 

325
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,710
one more down probably so right there
is where we will

326
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
is where we will
 

327
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,909
is where we will
have them fall wait how far of a drop is

328
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
have them fall wait how far of a drop is
 

329
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,629
have them fall wait how far of a drop is
that that's

330
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
that that's
 

331
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,629
that that's
that seems kind of far

332
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639

 

333
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,710

uh one two three

334
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
uh one two three
 

335
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,070
uh one two three
one two three four yeah that's fine

336
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
one two three four yeah that's fine
 

337
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,589
one two three four yeah that's fine
they'll take a little fall damage that's

338
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
they'll take a little fall damage that's
 

339
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,670
they'll take a little fall damage that's
that's not a big deal

340
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
that's not a big deal
 

341
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:15,350
that's not a big deal
and then we will make this come up

342
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360

 

343
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,510

and i got to decide which way i want to

344
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
and i got to decide which way i want to
 

345
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,430
and i got to decide which way i want to
put the villager which way i want the

346
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
put the villager which way i want the
 

347
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,350
put the villager which way i want the
ocelot and all that

348
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
ocelot and all that
 

349
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,990
ocelot and all that
uh let's see there's not a lot of space

350
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
uh let's see there's not a lot of space
 

351
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,589
uh let's see there's not a lot of space
on this side since they're falling down

352
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
on this side since they're falling down
 

353
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,550
on this side since they're falling down
already

354
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
already
 

355
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,830
already
so we're going to try to put the ocelot

356
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
so we're going to try to put the ocelot
 

357
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,270
so we're going to try to put the ocelot
here

358
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
here
 

359
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,670
here
to separate the creepers out so to do

360
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
to separate the creepers out so to do
 

361
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,430
to separate the creepers out so to do
that we'll need

362
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440

 

363
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,270

a half slab to hold them in place

364
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
a half slab to hold them in place
 

365
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,950
a half slab to hold them in place
oh i knew that's going to happen sooner

366
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
oh i knew that's going to happen sooner
 

367
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,629
oh i knew that's going to happen sooner
or later

368
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
or later
 

369
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,749
or later
i hate working up high man

370
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
i hate working up high man
 

371
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,670
i hate working up high man
it's like everything i do redstone and

372
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
it's like everything i do redstone and
 

373
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,189
it's like everything i do redstone and
everything i have to work

374
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
everything i have to work
 

375
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,749
everything i have to work
on these little platforms that are real

376
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
on these little platforms that are real
 

377
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,550
on these little platforms that are real
pain

378
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
pain
 

379
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,309
pain
and i would build a big platform but

380
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
and i would build a big platform but
 

381
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,790
and i would build a big platform but
then you gotta move it and

382
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
then you gotta move it and
 

383
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,270
then you gotta move it and
it rarely saves time

384
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280

 

385
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,710

okay we got to make a little holding

386
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
okay we got to make a little holding
 

387
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,150
okay we got to make a little holding
area for an ocelot here

388
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160

 

389
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,110

maybe make that come up oop

390
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120

 

391
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,430

there glass there

392
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
there glass there
 

393
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,350
there glass there
and i trap myself perfect

394
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
and i trap myself perfect
 

395
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,749
and i trap myself perfect
let's see we'll put a half slab

396
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759

 

397
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,870

and then glass block here i guess

398
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
and then glass block here i guess
 

399
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,430
and then glass block here i guess
so in that one by one area inside there

400
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
so in that one by one area inside there
 

401
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,709
so in that one by one area inside there
that's where we want the odd slot and

402
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
that's where we want the odd slot and
 

403
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,630
that's where we want the odd slot and
we'll have to go

404
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
we'll have to go
 

405
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,350
we'll have to go
tame one the nice thing is they finally

406
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
tame one the nice thing is they finally
 

407
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,070
tame one the nice thing is they finally
fixed that

408
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
fixed that
 

409
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,949
fixed that
i believe where the pets were randomly

410
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
i believe where the pets were randomly
 

411
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,790
i believe where the pets were randomly
teleporting to the player

412
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
teleporting to the player
 

413
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,750
teleporting to the player
when they got within a loaded chunk so

414
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
when they got within a loaded chunk so
 

415
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,590
when they got within a loaded chunk so
that was another problem i had last time

416
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
that was another problem i had last time
 

417
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,949
that was another problem i had last time
i tried to make a mob

418
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
i tried to make a mob
 

419
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,590
i tried to make a mob
sorter is uh that glitch made it

420
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
sorter is uh that glitch made it
 

421
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,070
sorter is uh that glitch made it
impossible to get an ocelot in place

422
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
impossible to get an ocelot in place
 

423
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,710
impossible to get an ocelot in place
and keep it in place

424
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720

 

425
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,230

okay fall down ocelot there

426
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
okay fall down ocelot there
 

427
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,030
okay fall down ocelot there
then we will make the creepers go this

428
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
then we will make the creepers go this
 

429
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,110
then we will make the creepers go this
way

430
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
way
 

431
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,190
way
and to do that we have to trick them

432
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
and to do that we have to trick them
 

433
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,590
and to do that we have to trick them
into falling

434
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
into falling
 

435
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,509
into falling
we'll have to have

436
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519

 

437
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,710

trap doors there's this trick you can do

438
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
trap doors there's this trick you can do
 

439
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,550
trap doors there's this trick you can do
with trapdoors where mobs will

440
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
with trapdoors where mobs will
 

441
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,710
with trapdoors where mobs will
see it as a as a block right but

442
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
see it as a as a block right but
 

443
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,269
see it as a as a block right but
since they're moving kind of quick they

444
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
since they're moving kind of quick they
 

445
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,949
since they're moving kind of quick they
they don't stop in time and they'll fall

446
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
they don't stop in time and they'll fall
 

447
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,509
they don't stop in time and they'll fall
off

448
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
off
 

449
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,470
off
as they run onto the block because it's

450
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
as they run onto the block because it's
 

451
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,230
as they run onto the block because it's
such a small

452
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
such a small
 

453
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,430
such a small
collision mask on it

454
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
collision mask on it
 

455
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,790
collision mask on it
okay

456
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800

 

457
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,710

and then we'll make this just make

458
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
and then we'll make this just make
 

459
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,110
and then we'll make this just make
things a little clearer

460
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120

 

461
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710

this might take a long time if i build

462
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
this might take a long time if i build
 

463
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,710
this might take a long time if i build
it all on camera maybe i should stop for

464
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
it all on camera maybe i should stop for
 

465
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,870
it all on camera maybe i should stop for
a sec

466
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
a sec
 

467
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,430
a sec
um

468
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440

 

469
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,670

well basically what i got to do here now

470
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
well basically what i got to do here now
 

471
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,230
well basically what i got to do here now
is i gotta make a big platform so when

472
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
is i gotta make a big platform so when
 

473
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,990
is i gotta make a big platform so when
they're running away from the ocelot

474
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
they're running away from the ocelot
 

475
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,990
they're running away from the ocelot
over there

476
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
over there
 

477
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,910
over there
they have a lot of space to run to

478
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
they have a lot of space to run to
 

479
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,269
they have a lot of space to run to
otherwise

480
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
otherwise
 

481
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,430
otherwise
they won't know where to go so we need a

482
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
they won't know where to go so we need a
 

483
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,310
they won't know where to go so we need a
fairly big platform

484
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

 

485
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,829

and we'll have to take out more of this

486
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
and we'll have to take out more of this
 

487
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,710
and we'll have to take out more of this
wall i'm sure too just to make it larger

488
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720

 

489
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,230

so anyway we got that going then

490
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
so anyway we got that going then
 

491
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,750
so anyway we got that going then
we're going to have a villager either

492
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
we're going to have a villager either
 

493
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,550
we're going to have a villager either
here or here let's

494
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
here or here let's
 

495
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,110
here or here let's
this doesn't really matter does it uh

496
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
this doesn't really matter does it uh
 

497
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,870
this doesn't really matter does it uh
let's put them

498
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
let's put them
 

499
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,470
let's put them
let's put them over here and we're going

500
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
let's put them over here and we're going
 

501
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,910
let's put them over here and we're going
to do the same thing we did with the

502
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
to do the same thing we did with the
 

503
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,910
to do the same thing we did with the
trap doors

504
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
trap doors
 

505
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,710
trap doors
we're gonna go two blocks and we'll have

506
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720

of we got to get a villager in here next
 

715
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,909
of we got to get a villager in here next
and that's probably going to be worse

716
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
and that's probably going to be worse
 

717
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,230

right in that spot
 

721
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,710
right in that spot
there and then we might

722
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
there and then we might
 

723
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,669
there and then we might
even be able to test this today

724
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679

 

725
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,470

739
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,590
easy from this and the tracks will take
them

740
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600

743
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,950
right up to the
the room we're working in the only thing

744
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
the room we're working in the only thing
 

745
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,789
the room we're working in the only thing
is i got to get him up to his spot so

746
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
is i got to get him up to his spot so
 

747
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,150
is i got to get him up to his spot so
i'll have to use

748
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
i'll have to use
 

749
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,950
i'll have to use
water elevators or or minecart tracks or

750
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
water elevators or or minecart tracks or
 

751
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,430
water elevators or or minecart tracks or
something to get them up there

752
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
something to get them up there
 

753
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,630
something to get them up there
so we just flip this on

754
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
so we just flip this on
 

755
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,909
so we just flip this on
and sift them out with this

756
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919

 

757
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,990

and there we go why is the trapdoor not

758
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
and there we go why is the trapdoor not
 

759
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,070
and there we go why is the trapdoor not
working

760
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
working
 

761
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,350
working

762
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
you almost got out i thought the
 

763
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,270
you almost got out i thought the
trapdoor was hooked up maybe my redstone

764
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
trapdoor was hooked up maybe my redstone
 

765
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,270

and assuming this all still works we

770
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
and assuming this all still works we
 

771
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,669
and assuming this all still works we
just give them medicine

772
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
just give them medicine
 

773
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,669

789
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,710

hmm that's too bad i'll have to force it

790
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
hmm that's too bad i'll have to force it
 

791
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,750
hmm that's too bad i'll have to force it
this time

792

i'm going to hook up to a redstone
 

987
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,310
i'm going to hook up to a redstone
circuit but for now

988
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
circuit but for now
 

989
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,470

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,510

see we gotta go one block higher

1000
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520

 

1001
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,950

so over here we will

1002
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
so over here we will
 

1003
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,070
so over here we will
set up some trip hooks

1004
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
set up some trip hooks
 

1005
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,269
set up some trip hooks
one over there one on the other side

1006
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
one over there one on the other side
 

1007
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,230
one over there one on the other side
and what these will do if a mob is in

1008
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
and what these will do if a mob is in
 

1009
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,950
and what these will do if a mob is in
this area

1010
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
this area
 

1011
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,510
this area
right here it's gonna turn on a redstone

1012
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
right here it's gonna turn on a redstone
 

1013
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,789
right here it's gonna turn on a redstone
clock

1014
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
clock
 

1015
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,310
clock
that will automatically automatically

1016
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
that will automatically automatically
 

1017
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,789
that will automatically automatically
control both of these doors and they'll

1018
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
control both of these doors and they'll
 

1019
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,830
control both of these doors and they'll
both open real quick like that

1020
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
both open real quick like that
 

1021
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,430
both open real quick like that
as long as there's a mob here if there's

1022
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
as long as there's a mob here if there's
 

1023
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,870
as long as there's a mob here if there's
no mob here i don't want the clock

1024
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
no mob here i don't want the clock
 

1025
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,430
no mob here i don't want the clock
running

1026
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
running
 

1027
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,549
running
so that is

1028
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
so that is
 

1029
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,549
so that is
the plan let's put that there

1030
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
the plan let's put that there
 

1031
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,269
the plan let's put that there
as a reminder and this will still work

1032
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
as a reminder and this will still work
 

1033
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,990
as a reminder and this will still work
with glass below like that which is good

1034
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
with glass below like that which is good
 

1035
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,950
with glass below like that which is good
should probably cover this

1036
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960

 

1037
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,870

beautiful all right so the idea is

1038
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
beautiful all right so the idea is
 

1039
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,430
beautiful all right so the idea is
mobs fall down here there's another

1040
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
mobs fall down here there's another
 

1041
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,149
mobs fall down here there's another
trapdoor

1042
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
trapdoor
 

1043
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,269
trapdoor
there uh zombies will seek out the

1044
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
there uh zombies will seek out the
 

1045
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,669
there uh zombies will seek out the
villager fairly quickly

1046
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
villager fairly quickly
 

1047
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,029
villager fairly quickly
but the creepers they only do or they'll

1048
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
but the creepers they only do or they'll
 

1049
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,909
but the creepers they only do or they'll
only move

1050
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
only move
 

1051
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,870
only move
quickly if they have a easy time finding

1052
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
quickly if they have a easy time finding
 

1053
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,430
quickly if they have a easy time finding
a spot to run to so that's why we have

1054
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
a spot to run to so that's why we have
 

1055
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,950
a spot to run to so that's why we have
all this land here we might have to

1056
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
all this land here we might have to
 

1057
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,430
all this land here we might have to
expand this some more yet this is 11 by

1058
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
expand this some more yet this is 11 by
 

1059
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,669
expand this some more yet this is 11 by
11

1060
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
11
 

1061
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,350
11
so they'll try to run over here and then

1062
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
so they'll try to run over here and then
 

1063
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,350
so they'll try to run over here and then
they'll fall down this

1064
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
they'll fall down this
 

1065
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,350
they'll fall down this
but the skeletons when they fall down

1066
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
but the skeletons when they fall down
 

1067
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,190
but the skeletons when they fall down
they don't really see a path to go to

1068
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
they don't really see a path to go to
 

1069
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,110
they don't really see a path to go to
because they really

1070
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
because they really
 

1071
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,190
because they really
i think they only really look at this

1072
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
i think they only really look at this
 

1073
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,230
i think they only really look at this
block this block

1074
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
block this block
 

1075
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,110
block this block
this trap door and that one so it's very

1076
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
this trap door and that one so it's very
 

1077
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,870
this trap door and that one so it's very
unlikely they're gonna move right away

1078
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
unlikely they're gonna move right away
 

1079
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,350
unlikely they're gonna move right away
when they

1080
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
when they
 

1081
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,470
when they
fall so as long as we flip this soon

1082
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
fall so as long as we flip this soon
 

1083
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,029
fall so as long as we flip this soon
enough

1084
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039

 

1085
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,110

as long as like after they fall if we

1086
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
as long as like after they fall if we
 

1087
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,510
as long as like after they fall if we
flip this pretty quickly afterwards

1088
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
flip this pretty quickly afterwards
 

1089
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,750
flip this pretty quickly afterwards
uh then it should keep skeletons from

1090
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
uh then it should keep skeletons from
 

1091
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,350
uh then it should keep skeletons from
going this way or

1092
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
going this way or
 

1093
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,710
going this way or
or that way uh because they are

1094
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
or that way uh because they are
 

1095
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,630
or that way uh because they are
able to go both those directions if they

1096
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
able to go both those directions if they
 

1097
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,390
able to go both those directions if they
choose to we just have to prevent them

1098
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
choose to we just have to prevent them
 

1099
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,990
choose to we just have to prevent them
from choosing that

1100
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000

 

1101
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,390

but enough talk let's give it a go hey

1102
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
but enough talk let's give it a go hey
 

1103
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,029
but enough talk let's give it a go hey
so let's

1104
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
so let's
 

1105
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,830
so let's
uh let's flip this this is all ready

1106
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840

 

1107
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,990

right

1108
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,000
right
 

1109
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,430
right
don't want to be wrong about this

1110
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
don't want to be wrong about this
 

1111
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,070
don't want to be wrong about this
because this could easily all explode

1112
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
because this could easily all explode
 

1113
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,590
because this could easily all explode
oh creeper first two yay

1114
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
oh creeper first two yay
 

1115
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,029
oh creeper first two yay
okay so he's over there

1116
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
okay so he's over there
 

1117
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,149
okay so he's over there
and he has a perfect

1118
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
and he has a perfect
 

1119
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,350
and he has a perfect
line of sight to us um

1120
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
line of sight to us um
 

1121
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,909
line of sight to us um
that shouldn't be let's get over to this

1122
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
that shouldn't be let's get over to this
 

1123
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,510
that shouldn't be let's get over to this
spot

1124
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520

 

1125
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,190

yeah so he moved fairly quick

1126
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
yeah so he moved fairly quick
 

1127
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,909
yeah so he moved fairly quick
that guy went there let's get this out

1128
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
that guy went there let's get this out
 

1129
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,230
that guy went there let's get this out
of here

1130
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
of here
 

1131
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,870
of here
the skeleton see he waits around for

1132
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
the skeleton see he waits around for
 

1133
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,430
the skeleton see he waits around for
quite a while

1134
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
quite a while
 

1135
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,669
quite a while
and before he has a chance to move this

1136
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
and before he has a chance to move this
 

1137
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,310
and before he has a chance to move this
will flip

1138
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320

 

1139
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,950

oh that's that's too long we need more

1140
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
oh that's that's too long we need more
 

1141
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,669
oh that's that's too long we need more
land here

1142
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679

 

1143
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,590

mobs do this thing now where they glitch

1144
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
mobs do this thing now where they glitch
 

1145
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,909
mobs do this thing now where they glitch
through the glass again

1146
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
through the glass again
 

1147
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,149
through the glass again
if they're under pressure that guy moved

1148
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
if they're under pressure that guy moved
 

1149
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,269
if they're under pressure that guy moved
quick

1150
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279

 

1151
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,389

that's fairly quick

1152
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399

 

1153
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,750

this is the main thing though that the

1154
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
this is the main thing though that the
 

1155
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,269
this is the main thing though that the
skeletons don't move let's just wait and

1156
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
skeletons don't move let's just wait and
 

1157
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,350
skeletons don't move let's just wait and
see how long it takes them to go

1158
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360

 

1159
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,149

there he goes and he didn't fall down

1160
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159

 

1161
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,710

this is really weird with the mobs i

1162
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
this is really weird with the mobs i
 

1163
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,549
this is really weird with the mobs i
hope they fix this

1164
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559

 

1165
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,549

this guy should push the skeleton off

1166
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
this guy should push the skeleton off
 

1167
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,710
this guy should push the skeleton off
yep

1168
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
yep
 

1169
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,669
yep
that's pretty cool

1170
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679

 

1171
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,510

and it should only let one through at a

1172
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
and it should only let one through at a
 

1173
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,950
and it should only let one through at a
time

1174
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
time
 

1175
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,750
time
uh with that gate up there they kind of

1176
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
uh with that gate up there they kind of
 

1177
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,029
uh with that gate up there they kind of
hold each other from

1178
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
hold each other from
 

1179
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,990
hold each other from
getting jammed all into one bunch

1180
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000

 

1181
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,990

oops so let's try one more zombie

1182
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000

 

1183
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,470

beautiful so we're going to drop them

1184
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
beautiful so we're going to drop them
 

1185
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,310
beautiful so we're going to drop them
into water streams below and then with

1186
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
into water streams below and then with
 

1187
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,630
into water streams below and then with
that

1188
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
that
 

1189
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,310
that
we're going to move them to where we

1190
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
we're going to move them to where we
 

1191
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,110
we're going to move them to where we
want and we need them separated for step

1192
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
want and we need them separated for step
 

1193
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,870
want and we need them separated for step
three of the project which we will get

1194
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
three of the project which we will get
 

1195
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,029
three of the project which we will get
to another time

1196
