37
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,150
everywheres
ever since then in the back of my mind

i've wanted to make a

we drop an anvil on

44
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
we drop an anvil on
 

45
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,350
we drop an anvil on
on the cows and then the meat starts

46
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
on the cows and then the meat starts
 

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,630
on the cows and then the meat starts
flying everywhere i thought that would

48
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
flying everywhere i thought that would
 

49
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,150
flying everywhere i thought that would
be a cool thing

50
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
be a cool thing
 

51
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,389
be a cool thing
but i haven't been able to automate it

52
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
but i haven't been able to automate it
 

53
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,110
but i haven't been able to automate it
like i haven't been able to find a way

54
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
like i haven't been able to find a way
 

55
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,150
like i haven't been able to find a way
to like reuse the anvils they always

56
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
to like reuse the anvils they always
 

57
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,549
to like reuse the anvils they always
break there's an issue with them because

58
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
break there's an issue with them because
 

59
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,310
break there's an issue with them because
as you know if you drop an anvil

60
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
as you know if you drop an anvil
 

61
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,390
as you know if you drop an anvil
it takes damage and eventually it's

62
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
it takes damage and eventually it's
 

63
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,590
it takes damage and eventually it's
gonna break right

64
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
gonna break right
 

65
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,870
gonna break right
so there's a way around that if you drop

66
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
so there's a way around that if you drop
 

67
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,950
so there's a way around that if you drop
it on a fence post like it is right now

68
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
it on a fence post like it is right now
 

69
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,749
it on a fence post like it is right now
it stays in its falling sand

70
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
it stays in its falling sand
 

71
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,710
it stays in its falling sand
uh entity mode so you check this out you

72
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
uh entity mode so you check this out you
 

73
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,390
uh entity mode so you check this out you
can actually launch it

74
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
can actually launch it
 

75
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,190
can actually launch it
and if it lands on the fence post again

76
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
and if it lands on the fence post again
 

77
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,230
and if it lands on the fence post again
it doesn't

78
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
it doesn't
 

79
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,270
it doesn't
break right it doesn't take any damage

80
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
break right it doesn't take any damage
 

81
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,149
break right it doesn't take any damage
and if you stand underneath here like if

82
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
and if you stand underneath here like if
 

83
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,749
and if you stand underneath here like if
you're a cow

84
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
you're a cow
 

85
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,310
you're a cow
you'll get whacked it'll actually do do

86
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
you'll get whacked it'll actually do do
 

87
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,749
you'll get whacked it'll actually do do
damage so that's good

88
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
damage so that's good
 

89
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,510
damage so that's good
the problem is which you'll see very

90
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
the problem is which you'll see very
 

91
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,550
the problem is which you'll see very
soon here

92
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
soon here
 

93
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,830
soon here
there we go after a certain amount of

94
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
there we go after a certain amount of
 

95
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,190
there we go after a certain amount of
falling

96
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
falling
 

97
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,670
falling
falling sand entities or falling anvils

98
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
falling sand entities or falling anvils
 

99
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,270
falling sand entities or falling anvils
eventually do just break

100
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
eventually do just break
 

101
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,510
eventually do just break
they turn into their item form which

102
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
they turn into their item form which
 

103
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,950
they turn into their item form which
kind of sucks

104
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
kind of sucks
 

105
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,469
kind of sucks
um this started off as a

106
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
um this started off as a
 

107
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,389
um this started off as a
as a slightly damaged and built now it's

108
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
as a slightly damaged and built now it's
 

109
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,709
as a slightly damaged and built now it's
a very damaged anvil as well

110
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
a very damaged anvil as well
 

111
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,389
a very damaged anvil as well
even though it never landed on it

112
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
even though it never landed on it
 

113
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,789
even though it never landed on it
anything it took damage

114
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
anything it took damage
 

115
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,229
anything it took damage
so it's kind of an interesting thing

116
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
so it's kind of an interesting thing
 

117
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,630
so it's kind of an interesting thing
here like an anvil will lose durability

118
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
here like an anvil will lose durability
 

119
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,270
here like an anvil will lose durability
doing this

120
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
doing this
 

121
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,750
doing this
but it won't ever totally break like

122
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
but it won't ever totally break like
 

123
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,750
but it won't ever totally break like
this very damaged anvil won't

124
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
this very damaged anvil won't
 

125
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,070
this very damaged anvil won't
disappear on us it'll turn to its item

126
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
disappear on us it'll turn to its item
 

127
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,110
disappear on us it'll turn to its item
form

128
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
form
 

129
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,790
form
once it's a falling sand entity for a

130
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
once it's a falling sand entity for a
 

131
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,150
once it's a falling sand entity for a
long time like this has been sitting

132
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
long time like this has been sitting
 

133
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,910
long time like this has been sitting
here so as soon as we try to

134
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
here so as soon as we try to
 

135
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,030
here so as soon as we try to
to bounce it up it's gonna break again

136
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
to bounce it up it's gonna break again
 

137
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,309
to bounce it up it's gonna break again
right so it turns it back to its item

138
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
right so it turns it back to its item
 

139
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,350
right so it turns it back to its item
form

140
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
form
 

141
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,990
form
it doesn't destroy the anvil but there's

142
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
it doesn't destroy the anvil but there's
 

143
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,910
it doesn't destroy the anvil but there's
no way to automatically place it back in

144
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
no way to automatically place it back in
 

145
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,270
no way to automatically place it back in
the world at the end so that's why i

146
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
the world at the end so that's why i
 

147
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,430
the world at the end so that's why i
haven't been able to automate

148
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
haven't been able to automate
 

149
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,070
haven't been able to automate
this sort of killing device maybe you

150
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
this sort of killing device maybe you
 

151
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,670
this sort of killing device maybe you
guys have an idea of how to

152
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
guys have an idea of how to
 

153
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,750
guys have an idea of how to
i have no clue though i haven't been

154
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
i have no clue though i haven't been
 

155
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,030
i have no clue though i haven't been
able to figure it out

156
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
able to figure it out
 

157
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,070
able to figure it out
now if you catch the anvil gently

158
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
now if you catch the anvil gently
 

159
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,390
now if you catch the anvil gently
like let's say we we stop it at the very

160
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
like let's say we we stop it at the very
 

161
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
like let's say we we stop it at the very
top of the arc there

162
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
top of the arc there
 

163
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,509
top of the arc there
and we put a block underneath it to turn

164
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
and we put a block underneath it to turn
 

165
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,990
and we put a block underneath it to turn
it back to its block form

166
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
it back to its block form
 

167
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,070
it back to its block form
that's no no bueno that doesn't work

168
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
that's no no bueno that doesn't work
 

169
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,750
that's no no bueno that doesn't work
either that will destroy the anvil

170
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
either that will destroy the anvil
 

171
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,509
either that will destroy the anvil
because it seems to calculate how long

172
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
because it seems to calculate how long
 

173
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,869
because it seems to calculate how long
it's been falling for

174
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
it's been falling for
 

175
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,830
it's been falling for
and then it applies all that damage even

176
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
and then it applies all that damage even
 

177
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,589
and then it applies all that damage even
if it's not moving very fast when it

178
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
if it's not moving very fast when it
 

179
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:09,990
if it's not moving very fast when it
hits

180
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
hits
 

181
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,589
hits
hits the ground and uh here's how it

182
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
hits the ground and uh here's how it
 

183
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,030
hits the ground and uh here's how it
works in case you're curious it's a

184
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
works in case you're curious it's a
 

185
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,750
works in case you're curious it's a
simple thing

186
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
simple thing
 

187
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,949
simple thing
sticky piston sticky piston the anvil

188
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
sticky piston sticky piston the anvil
 

189
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,350
sticky piston sticky piston the anvil
sits

190
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
sits
 

191
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,910
sits
on top of this fence post right and then

192
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
on top of this fence post right and then
 

193
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,030
on top of this fence post right and then
it moves it to the right

194
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
it moves it to the right
 

195
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,630
it moves it to the right
and then up so the slime block goes

196
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
and then up so the slime block goes
 

197
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,949
and then up so the slime block goes
underneath the anvil

198
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
underneath the anvil
 

199
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,470
underneath the anvil
and then it moves it upwards as the

200
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
and then it moves it upwards as the
 

201
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,070
and then it moves it upwards as the
anvil is falling down and that's what

202
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
anvil is falling down and that's what
 

203
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,789
anvil is falling down and that's what
balances it

204
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
balances it
 

205
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,030
balances it
okay guys so let's take a look here at

206
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
okay guys so let's take a look here at
 

207
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,229
okay guys so let's take a look here at
our big book

208
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
our big book
 

209
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,110
our big book
of never finishing projects uh we are

210
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
of never finishing projects uh we are
 

211
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,949
of never finishing projects uh we are
getting a few of these done

212
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
getting a few of these done
 

213
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,589
getting a few of these done
but number 17 on the list we have the

214
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
but number 17 on the list we have the
 

215
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,110
but number 17 on the list we have the
simon game that's what we're gonna work

216
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
simon game that's what we're gonna work
 

217
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,229
simon game that's what we're gonna work
on here today we're gonna do some

218
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
on here today we're gonna do some
 

219
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,070
on here today we're gonna do some
redstone stuff

220
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
redstone stuff
 

221
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,350
redstone stuff
try get that done if we can um every

222
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
try get that done if we can um every
 

223
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,270
try get that done if we can um every
project we get done on there

224
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
project we get done on there
 

225
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,509
project we get done on there
is a new one i can start and not finish

226
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
is a new one i can start and not finish
 

227
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,589
is a new one i can start and not finish
and not feel guilty

228
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
and not feel guilty
 

229
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,350
and not feel guilty
so we wanna get as many of those done as

230
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
so we wanna get as many of those done as
 

231
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,949
so we wanna get as many of those done as
we can

232
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
we can
 

233
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,630
we can
but yeah last episode we checked out

234
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
but yeah last episode we checked out
 

235
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,630
but yeah last episode we checked out
that new memory system

236
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
that new memory system
 

237
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,550
that new memory system
and a lot of you were excited about it i

238
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
and a lot of you were excited about it i
 

239
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,149
and a lot of you were excited about it i
just showed it off i didn't actually do

240
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
just showed it off i didn't actually do
 

241
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,030
just showed it off i didn't actually do
anything with it

242
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
anything with it
 

243
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,309
anything with it
today we're going to actually do

244
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
today we're going to actually do
 

245
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,550
today we're going to actually do
something with it we're going to use it

246
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
something with it we're going to use it
 

247
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
something with it we're going to use it
to try uh finish this game and make it

248
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
to try uh finish this game and make it
 

249
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,350
to try uh finish this game and make it
better

250
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
better
 

251
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,189
better
so let's let's start with the

252
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
so let's let's start with the
 

253
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,030
so let's let's start with the
demonstration i think it still works

254
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040

 

255
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,070

maybe blue let's just try random

256
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
maybe blue let's just try random
 

257
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,590
maybe blue let's just try random
pressure plates here

258
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
pressure plates here
 

259
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,110
pressure plates here
i think it's waiting for input right now

260
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
i think it's waiting for input right now
 

261
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,469
i think it's waiting for input right now
okay it was green next one is blue

262
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
okay it was green next one is blue
 

263
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,830
okay it was green next one is blue
i don't know why it's telling us the

264
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
i don't know why it's telling us the
 

265
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,189
i don't know why it's telling us the
answer okay then there's a

266
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
answer okay then there's a
 

267
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,110
answer okay then there's a
pause and now is it going to run through

268
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
pause and now is it going to run through
 

269
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,710
pause and now is it going to run through
the sequence

270
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
the sequence
 

271
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,550
the sequence
yeah okay here we go yellow

272
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
yeah okay here we go yellow
 

273
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,430
yeah okay here we go yellow
green notice how slow this is guys the

274
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
green notice how slow this is guys the
 

275
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,030
green notice how slow this is guys the
the timing between these is very long

276
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
the timing between these is very long
 

277
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,189
the timing between these is very long
after we redo the memory here today this

278
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
after we redo the memory here today this
 

279
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,070
after we redo the memory here today this
should be like

280
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

281
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110

hopefully but that was

282
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
hopefully but that was
 

283
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,550
hopefully but that was
like one of the big reasons why this

284
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
like one of the big reasons why this
 

285
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,150
like one of the big reasons why this
game was kind of

286
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
game was kind of
 

287
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,590
game was kind of
terrible and i didn't really want to

288
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
terrible and i didn't really want to
 

289
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,830
terrible and i didn't really want to
finish it the way it was

290
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
finish it the way it was
 

291
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,430
finish it the way it was
um the other thing

292
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
um the other thing
 

293
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,629
um the other thing
oh man this gives me nightmares coming

294
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
oh man this gives me nightmares coming
 

295
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,390
oh man this gives me nightmares coming
back here again

296
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
back here again
 

297
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,550
back here again
uh the other thing is this was the old

298
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
uh the other thing is this was the old
 

299
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,150
uh the other thing is this was the old
memory system over here you see these

300
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
memory system over here you see these
 

301
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,990
memory system over here you see these
hoppers and the droppers

302
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
hoppers and the droppers
 

303
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,870
hoppers and the droppers
um the way this was working each one of

304
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
um the way this was working each one of
 

305
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,270
um the way this was working each one of
these

306
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
these
 

307
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,670
these
held an entry so we got blue over there

308
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
held an entry so we got blue over there
 

309
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,029
held an entry so we got blue over there
yellow green we could only have like one

310
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
yellow green we could only have like one
 

311
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,990
yellow green we could only have like one
every every hopper dropper combo here so

312
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
every every hopper dropper combo here so
 

313
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,310
every every hopper dropper combo here so
if we wanted to store like 40 answers we

314
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
if we wanted to store like 40 answers we
 

315
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,070
if we wanted to store like 40 answers we
would need 40 droppers

316
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
would need 40 droppers
 

317
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,790
would need 40 droppers
and hoppers paired together here so this

318
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
and hoppers paired together here so this
 

319
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,469
and hoppers paired together here so this
was not even close to complete this was

320
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
was not even close to complete this was
 

321
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,550
was not even close to complete this was
going to get a lot bigger

322
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
going to get a lot bigger
 

323
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,310
going to get a lot bigger
and a lot slower

324
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320

 

325
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,270

so the good news is we are done with all

326
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
so the good news is we are done with all
 

327
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,230
so the good news is we are done with all
this stuff

328
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
this stuff
 

329
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,990
this stuff
we're going to switch over to a binary

330
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
we're going to switch over to a binary
 

331
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,510
we're going to switch over to a binary
system

332
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
system
 

333
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,670
system
using that hard drive sort of thing we

334
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
using that hard drive sort of thing we
 

335
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,350
using that hard drive sort of thing we
figured out

336
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
figured out
 

337
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,270
figured out
before we were using item filters you

338
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
before we were using item filters you
 

339
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,590
before we were using item filters you
see how it was detecting the clay blocks

340
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
see how it was detecting the clay blocks
 

341
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,909
see how it was detecting the clay blocks
the four different colors after it would

342
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
the four different colors after it would
 

343
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,710
the four different colors after it would
detect those

344
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
detect those
 

345
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,870
detect those
it would save save the answer to memory

346
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
it would save save the answer to memory
 

347
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,550
it would save save the answer to memory
over here

348
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
over here
 

349
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,510
over here
the redstone block would move over and

350
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
the redstone block would move over and
 

351
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,550
the redstone block would move over and
then

352
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
then
 

353
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,629
then
that would connect up to the display or

354
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
that would connect up to the display or
 

355
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,309
that would connect up to the display or
else it would check if it matched

356
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
else it would check if it matched
 

357
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,710
else it would check if it matched
our input depending on if it was showing

358
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
our input depending on if it was showing
 

359
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,830
our input depending on if it was showing
us

360
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
us
 

361
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,430
us
the sequence or if it was waiting for

362
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
the sequence or if it was waiting for
 

363
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,029
the sequence or if it was waiting for
our input

364
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
our input
 

365
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,950
our input
um so yeah anyways blah blah blah blah

366
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
um so yeah anyways blah blah blah blah
 

367
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,230
um so yeah anyways blah blah blah blah
blah

368
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
blah
 

369
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,870
blah
guess what we gonna do here rip it all

370
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
guess what we gonna do here rip it all
 

371
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,510
guess what we gonna do here rip it all
out

372
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
out
 

373
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,749
out
oh yes start fresh make it better

374
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
oh yes start fresh make it better
 

375
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,909
oh yes start fresh make it better
let's clean this baby up i think we rip

376
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
let's clean this baby up i think we rip
 

377
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,510
let's clean this baby up i think we rip
out everything pretty much

378
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
out everything pretty much
 

379
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,390
out everything pretty much
uh from like here to the left

380
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
uh from like here to the left
 

381
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,629
uh from like here to the left
can go everything up here is for the

382
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
can go everything up here is for the
 

383
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,990
can go everything up here is for the
display that can all stay

384
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
display that can all stay
 

385
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,589
display that can all stay
everything to the right here is for the

386
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
everything to the right here is for the
 

387
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,830
everything to the right here is for the
inputs we can leave that

388
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
inputs we can leave that
 

389
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,990
inputs we can leave that
but most of this needs to be redone over

390
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
but most of this needs to be redone over
 

391
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,870
but most of this needs to be redone over
here

392
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
here
 

393
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,029
here
and a lot of this was just like timings

394
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
and a lot of this was just like timings
 

395
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,469
and a lot of this was just like timings
to control

396
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
to control
 

397
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,589
to control
the the memory device here which we're

398
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
the the memory device here which we're
 

399
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,790
the the memory device here which we're
redoing so

400
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
redoing so
 

401
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,469
redoing so
yeah let's tear it out

402
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
yeah let's tear it out
 

403
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,550
yeah let's tear it out
whoo all right well look at that we have

404
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
whoo all right well look at that we have
 

405
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,710
whoo all right well look at that we have
a lot of free space here now

406
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
a lot of free space here now
 

407
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,430
a lot of free space here now
a lot of a lot of work to do to get this

408
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
a lot of a lot of work to do to get this
 

409
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,830
a lot of a lot of work to do to get this
uh

410
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
uh
 

411
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,710
uh
working again uh but i left it off over

412
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
working again uh but i left it off over
 

413
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,870
working again uh but i left it off over
here this is where we're gonna start

414
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
here this is where we're gonna start
 

415
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,990
here this is where we're gonna start
uh this connects directly to the display

416
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
uh this connects directly to the display
 

417
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,510
uh this connects directly to the display
stuff up there so if we press the red

418
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
stuff up there so if we press the red
 

419
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,710
stuff up there so if we press the red
one

420
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
one
 

421
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,390
one
you can see the red clay blocks pop out

422
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
you can see the red clay blocks pop out
 

423
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,309
you can see the red clay blocks pop out
of the screen

424
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
of the screen
 

425
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,749
of the screen
we're on the back side of course so it

426
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
we're on the back side of course so it
 

427
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,909
we're on the back side of course so it
doesn't look right but

428
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
doesn't look right but
 

429
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,110
doesn't look right but
yeah green blocks up there so now uh we

430
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
yeah green blocks up there so now uh we
 

431
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,870
yeah green blocks up there so now uh we
want to connect our display to our

432
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
want to connect our display to our
 

433
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,150
want to connect our display to our
memory

434
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
memory
 

435
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,629
memory
uh device but before we do that we

436
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
uh device but before we do that we
 

437
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,749
uh device but before we do that we
probably want to

438
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
probably want to
 

439
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,510
probably want to
add some way of controlling it because

440
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
add some way of controlling it because
 

441
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,430
add some way of controlling it because
when we're putting the input into the

442
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
when we're putting the input into the
 

443
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,350
when we're putting the input into the
game when we're giving our answers

444
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
game when we're giving our answers
 

445
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,430
game when we're giving our answers
to copy the sequence we don't want the

446
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
to copy the sequence we don't want the
 

447
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,270
to copy the sequence we don't want the
display

448
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
display
 

449
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,270
display
showing what the memory says there's

450
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
showing what the memory says there's
 

451
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,550
showing what the memory says there's
like two game modes

452
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
like two game modes
 

453
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,550
like two game modes
to this game it first it shows us the

454
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
to this game it first it shows us the
 

455
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,430
to this game it first it shows us the
answers and then it waits for us to

456
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
answers and then it waits for us to
 

457
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,670
answers and then it waits for us to
to input the answers right so we want to

458
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
to input the answers right so we want to
 

459
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,309
to input the answers right so we want to
shut the display off during the input

460
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
shut the display off during the input
 

461
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,510
shut the display off during the input
so to do that we're just going to have

462
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
so to do that we're just going to have
 

463
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,350
so to do that we're just going to have
some sticky pistons

464
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
some sticky pistons
 

465
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,589
some sticky pistons
running along here when the clay block

466
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
running along here when the clay block
 

467
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,790
running along here when the clay block
is down

468
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
is down
 

469
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,869
is down
the display will be active when it's up

470
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
the display will be active when it's up
 

471
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,150
the display will be active when it's up
it'll be off

472
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160

 

473
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,390

okay so we're already off to a bad start

474
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
okay so we're already off to a bad start
 

475
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,110
okay so we're already off to a bad start
here i think this is a redstone bug

476
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
here i think this is a redstone bug
 

477
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,150
here i think this is a redstone bug
for some reason the red one is staying

478
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
for some reason the red one is staying
 

479
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,990
for some reason the red one is staying
down

480
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000

 

481
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,149

no idea why it's not being powered right

482
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
no idea why it's not being powered right
 

483
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,190
no idea why it's not being powered right
now right

484
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200

 

485
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,430

but when you update it

486
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
but when you update it
 

487
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,710
but when you update it
yeah something really wonky is going on

488
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah something really wonky is going on
 

489
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,150
yeah something really wonky is going on
why did this have to happen to me

490
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
why did this have to happen to me
 

491
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,990
why did this have to happen to me
uh i guess we'll have to do it like this

492
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
uh i guess we'll have to do it like this
 

493
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,150
uh i guess we'll have to do it like this
i got a wavy line going over top

494
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
i got a wavy line going over top
 

495
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,310
i got a wavy line going over top
i don't like that it takes up more space

496
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
i don't like that it takes up more space
 

497
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,710
i don't like that it takes up more space
but uh

498
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
but uh
 

499
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,110
but uh
at least it works right i think what was

500
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
at least it works right i think what was
 

501
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,150
at least it works right i think what was
happening for some reason

502
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
happening for some reason
 

503
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,949
happening for some reason
this block was unpowering first right

504
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
this block was unpowering first right
 

505
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,550
this block was unpowering first right
and then this one was still powered so

506
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
and then this one was still powered so
 

507
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,030
and then this one was still powered so
it was

508
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
it was
 

509
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,870
it was
diagonally powering the piston causing

510
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
diagonally powering the piston causing
 

511
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,150
diagonally powering the piston causing
it to bud

512
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
it to bud
 

513
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,910
it to bud
even though the redstone wire was all

514
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
even though the redstone wire was all
 

515
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,470
even though the redstone wire was all
supposed to unpower at the same time

516
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
supposed to unpower at the same time
 

517
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,470
supposed to unpower at the same time
don't ever recall that being an issue in

518
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
don't ever recall that being an issue in
 

519
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,269
don't ever recall that being an issue in
mine graph but it is now apparently

520
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
mine graph but it is now apparently
 

521
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,590
mine graph but it is now apparently
all right so let's say for example in

522
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
all right so let's say for example in
 

523
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,150
all right so let's say for example in
memory it's showing the

524
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
memory it's showing the
 

525
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,949
memory it's showing the
it should be red right on the display

526
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
it should be red right on the display
 

527
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,350
it should be red right on the display
then

528
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
then
 

529
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,630
then
if we want to display that

530
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640

 

531
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,310

press a button we can control how long

532
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
press a button we can control how long
 

533
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,310
press a button we can control how long
it shows up on the on the screen by how

534
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
it shows up on the on the screen by how
 

535
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,470
it shows up on the on the screen by how
long this is powered

536
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
long this is powered
 

537
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,269
long this is powered
or if this is during the input sequence

538
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
or if this is during the input sequence
 

539
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,550
or if this is during the input sequence
we don't have to display it on the

540
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
we don't have to display it on the
 

541
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,070
we don't have to display it on the
screen we have the option

542
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
screen we have the option
 

543
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,470
screen we have the option
so that's cool uh next thing we got to

544
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
so that's cool uh next thing we got to
 

545
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,750
so that's cool uh next thing we got to
do here is uh

546
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
do here is uh
 

547
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,590
do here is uh
again connect this to the memory so

548
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
again connect this to the memory so
 

549
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,670
again connect this to the memory so
we're using a binary system you know

550
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
we're using a binary system you know
 

551
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,269
we're using a binary system you know
zeros and ones

552
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
zeros and ones
 

553
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,750
zeros and ones
problem is zero and one that's only two

554
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
problem is zero and one that's only two
 

555
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,509
problem is zero and one that's only two
possibilities two outcomes

556
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
possibilities two outcomes
 

557
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,910
possibilities two outcomes
we need four in total here red blue

558
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
we need four in total here red blue
 

559
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,030
we need four in total here red blue
yellow green

560
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
yellow green
 

561
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,870
yellow green
so we're gonna have to combine two bits

562
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
so we're gonna have to combine two bits
 

563
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,069
so we're gonna have to combine two bits
together to

564
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
together to
 

565
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,110
together to
create four outcomes okay

566
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
create four outcomes okay
 

567
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,829
create four outcomes okay
now to do that isn't so simple

568
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
now to do that isn't so simple
 

569
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,790
now to do that isn't so simple
because we need to build a binary

570
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
because we need to build a binary
 

571
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,870
because we need to build a binary
decoder

572
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
decoder
 

573
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,590
decoder
um which i've made in creative already

574
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
um which i've made in creative already
 

575
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,269
um which i've made in creative already
so i'm just gonna build it here and

576
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
so i'm just gonna build it here and
 

577
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,550
so i'm just gonna build it here and
show it to you how it works and here it

578
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
show it to you how it works and here it
 

579
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,310
show it to you how it works and here it
is guys so check it out this is my

580
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
is guys so check it out this is my
 

581
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,389
is guys so check it out this is my
two-bit decoder

582
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
two-bit decoder
 

583
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,630
two-bit decoder
pay attention we have four redstone

584
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
pay attention we have four redstone
 

585
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,630
pay attention we have four redstone
torches down there and we have two wires

586
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
torches down there and we have two wires
 

587
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,550
torches down there and we have two wires
up here so this

588
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
up here so this
 

589
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,870
up here so this
device takes the information from these

590
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
device takes the information from these
 

591
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,910
device takes the information from these
two wires the on

592
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
two wires the on
 

593
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,030
two wires the on
off information and converts it to four

594
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
off information and converts it to four
 

595
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,509
off information and converts it to four
unique

596
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
unique
 

597
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,710
unique
outputs okay so right now it's off off

598
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
outputs okay so right now it's off off
 

599
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,590
outputs okay so right now it's off off
and that the green one's on right now if

600
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
and that the green one's on right now if
 

601
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,069
and that the green one's on right now if
we

602
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
we
 

603
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,069
we
do this off on we have the yellow one on

604
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
do this off on we have the yellow one on
 

605
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,269
do this off on we have the yellow one on
if we do on off we have the blue one

606
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
if we do on off we have the blue one
 

607
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,389
if we do on off we have the blue one
and on on is the red one

608
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
and on on is the red one
 

609
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,630
and on on is the red one
so that's that's the key it it splits it

610
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
so that's that's the key it it splits it
 

611
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,430
so that's that's the key it it splits it
into four outputs we can use very easily

612
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
into four outputs we can use very easily
 

613
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,509
into four outputs we can use very easily
with our display

614
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519

 

615
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,350

hmm all right a little bit later here

616
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
hmm all right a little bit later here
 

617
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,590
hmm all right a little bit later here
guys i've been uh pulling my hair out

618
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
guys i've been uh pulling my hair out
 

619
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,509
guys i've been uh pulling my hair out
trying to get this thing working

620
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
trying to get this thing working
 

621
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,150
trying to get this thing working
and this is about as fast as i think i

622
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
and this is about as fast as i think i
 

623
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,430
and this is about as fast as i think i
can get it to work

624
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440

 

625
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,949

which i would like it a little bit

626
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
which i would like it a little bit
 

627
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,630
which i would like it a little bit
quicker honestly but

628
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
quicker honestly but
 

629
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,790
quicker honestly but
it's not terrible terrible it's way

630
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
it's not terrible terrible it's way
 

631
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,350
it's not terrible terrible it's way
better than it was

632
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
better than it was
 

633
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,110
better than it was
let's hop down here we'll try to speed

634
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
let's hop down here we'll try to speed
 

635
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,870
let's hop down here we'll try to speed
it up a bit more and just see what

636
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
it up a bit more and just see what
 

637
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,949
it up a bit more and just see what
happens

638
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
happens
 

639
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,630
happens
alright so notice uh

640
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
alright so notice uh
 

641
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,350
alright so notice uh
notice the lights over there as soon as

642
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
notice the lights over there as soon as
 

643
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,389
notice the lights over there as soon as
they settle

644
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
they settle
 

645
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,470
they settle
these piston arms go down yellow

646
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
these piston arms go down yellow
 

647
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,269
these piston arms go down yellow
green you see how the blue kind of

648
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
green you see how the blue kind of
 

649
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,389
green you see how the blue kind of
flashed there

650
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
flashed there
 

651
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,990
flashed there
but that would that didn't affect it

652
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
but that would that didn't affect it
 

653
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,829
but that would that didn't affect it
because the piston arms weren't down

654
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
because the piston arms weren't down
 

655
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,550
because the piston arms weren't down
during that flash so it's only

656
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
during that flash so it's only
 

657
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,670
during that flash so it's only
once it settles that it actually sends

658
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
once it settles that it actually sends
 

659
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,230
once it settles that it actually sends
the information to the display

660
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
the information to the display
 

661
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,790
the information to the display
uh let's go ahead though and take one

662
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
uh let's go ahead though and take one
 

663
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,030
uh let's go ahead though and take one
item out of here

664
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040

 

665
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,110

and it probably broke everything now

666
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
and it probably broke everything now
 

667
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,269
and it probably broke everything now
right

668
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279

 

669
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,350

let's go look it it doesn't look like

670
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
let's go look it it doesn't look like
 

671
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,990
let's go look it it doesn't look like
it's good though

672
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000

 

673
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,949

all right what's the display doing now

674
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959

 

675
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,949

it's broken yep

676
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
it's broken yep
 

677
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,870
it's broken yep
some sometimes uh green and red were

678
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
some sometimes uh green and red were
 

679
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,310
some sometimes uh green and red were
activating at the same time there

680
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
activating at the same time there
 

681
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,590
activating at the same time there
yeah so it's too fast for it well

682
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah so it's too fast for it well
 

683
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,350
yeah so it's too fast for it well
i tell you what guys i've kind of had

684
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
i tell you what guys i've kind of had
 

685
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,509
i tell you what guys i've kind of had
enough of this uh for today here

686
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
enough of this uh for today here
 

687
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,509
enough of this uh for today here
i i wanted to try finish it but i know

688
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
i i wanted to try finish it but i know
 

689
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,069
i i wanted to try finish it but i know
it's gonna take me many more hours so

690
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
it's gonna take me many more hours so
 

691
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,389
it's gonna take me many more hours so
i think we should uh call it here on

692
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
i think we should uh call it here on
 

693
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,150
i think we should uh call it here on
this and move on to something else

694
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
this and move on to something else
 

695
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,230
this and move on to something else
i'll just show you what we did uh so far

696
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
i'll just show you what we did uh so far
 

697
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,310
i'll just show you what we did uh so far
here though we made good progress

698
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
here though we made good progress
 

699
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,030
here though we made good progress
we got our tube our two-bit decoder here

700
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
we got our tube our two-bit decoder here
 

701
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,350
we got our tube our two-bit decoder here
like

702
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
like
 

703
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,350
like
like we set up before and now we have

704
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
like we set up before and now we have
 

705
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,750
like we set up before and now we have
the binary readers set up we have two of

706
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
the binary readers set up we have two of
 

707
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,389
the binary readers set up we have two of
them

708
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
them
 

709
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,389
them
we're using a brewing stand method now

710
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
we're using a brewing stand method now
 

711
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,750
we're using a brewing stand method now
instead of the water bucket thing i

712
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
instead of the water bucket thing i
 

713
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,790
instead of the water bucket thing i
showed originally

714
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
showed originally
 

715
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,190
showed originally
in the last video this was your guys's

716
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
in the last video this was your guys's
 

717
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,190
in the last video this was your guys's
suggestion and it works great

718
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
suggestion and it works great
 

719
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,670
suggestion and it works great
it's a really good idea you also

720
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
it's a really good idea you also
 

721
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,590
it's a really good idea you also
suggested using named items which you

722
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
suggested using named items which you
 

723
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,710
suggested using named items which you
could do

724
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
could do
 

725
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,310
could do
but this method you don't have to name

726
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
but this method you don't have to name
 

727
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,069
but this method you don't have to name
anything so i like it a lot

728
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
anything so i like it a lot
 

729
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,629
anything so i like it a lot
so if you have a non-stackable item like

730
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
so if you have a non-stackable item like
 

731
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,670
so if you have a non-stackable item like
a shovel in here

732
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
a shovel in here
 

733
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,110
a shovel in here
this is a zero in our binary reader

734
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
this is a zero in our binary reader
 

735
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,870
this is a zero in our binary reader
and we activate the dropper nothing

736
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
and we activate the dropper nothing
 

737
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,710
and we activate the dropper nothing
happens it stays in the dropper but if

738
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
happens it stays in the dropper but if
 

739
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,310
happens it stays in the dropper but if
it's a water bottle

740
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
it's a water bottle
 

741
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,590
it's a water bottle
or some other brewing item it goes into

742
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
or some other brewing item it goes into
 

743
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,269
or some other brewing item it goes into
the brewing stand

744
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
the brewing stand
 

745
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,189
the brewing stand
so that's that's our one and you can see

746
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
so that's that's our one and you can see
 

747
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,710
so that's that's our one and you can see
here

748
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
here
 

749
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,829
here
i fall down darn it

750
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839

 

751
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,670

oh seriously

752
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
oh seriously
 

753
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,629
oh seriously
come on i'm like sliding off that block

754
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
come on i'm like sliding off that block
 

755
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,230
come on i'm like sliding off that block
you see that i'm hitting the block and

756
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
you see that i'm hitting the block and
 

757
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,110
you see that i'm hitting the block and
then i'm like sliding off of it somehow

758
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
then i'm like sliding off of it somehow
 

759
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,269
then i'm like sliding off of it somehow
there we go oh man one ender pearl left

760
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
there we go oh man one ender pearl left
 

761
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:01,910
there we go oh man one ender pearl left
to go

762
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
to go
 

763
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,030
to go
restock here so yeah we have a zero and

764
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
restock here so yeah we have a zero and
 

765
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,509
restock here so yeah we have a zero and
one

766
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
one
 

767
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,829
one
in our reader right now uh this is our

768
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
in our reader right now uh this is our
 

769
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,750
in our reader right now uh this is our
data stream in this chest

770
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
data stream in this chest
 

771
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,150
data stream in this chest
and as it goes through we kind of have

772
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
and as it goes through we kind of have
 

773
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,949
and as it goes through we kind of have
to prevent

774
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
to prevent
 

775
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,350
to prevent
it from re-entering here so i'm storing

776
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
it from re-entering here so i'm storing
 

777
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,509
it from re-entering here so i'm storing
them up here

778
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
them up here
 

779
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,389
them up here
until this chest empties so if we press

780
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
until this chest empties so if we press
 

781
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,910
until this chest empties so if we press
this

782
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
this
 

783
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,870
this
it'll advance it forward by one and we

784
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
it'll advance it forward by one and we
 

785
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,750
it'll advance it forward by one and we
have a one

786
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
have a one
 

787
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,230
have a one
one and this connects directly to our

788
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
one and this connects directly to our
 

789
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,670
one and this connects directly to our
two bit decoder so it's actually

790
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
two bit decoder so it's actually
 

791
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,509
two bit decoder so it's actually
outputting a signal here so it's on the

792
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
outputting a signal here so it's on the
 

793
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,110
outputting a signal here so it's on the
red right now

794
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
red right now
 

795
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,230
red right now
um we've got one item left here

796
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
um we've got one item left here
 

797
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,470
um we've got one item left here
activated again and we have a zero zero

798
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
activated again and we have a zero zero
 

799
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,509
activated again and we have a zero zero
this time so

800
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
this time so
 

801
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,310
this time so
that is the green and yeah it works

802
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
that is the green and yeah it works
 

803
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,670
that is the green and yeah it works
pretty good

804
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
pretty good
 

805
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,629
pretty good
um you can see the items are still in in

806
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
um you can see the items are still in in
 

807
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,389
um you can see the items are still in in
the dropper or in the brewing stand here

808
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
the dropper or in the brewing stand here
 

809
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,230
the dropper or in the brewing stand here
though

810
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
though
 

811
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,629
though
right and i have a comparator signal

812
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
right and i have a comparator signal
 

813
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,350
right and i have a comparator signal
here

814
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
here
 

815
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,030
here
for both of them which we merge together

816
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
for both of them which we merge together
 

817
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,189
for both of them which we merge together
and that goes up to this hopper here

818
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
and that goes up to this hopper here
 

819
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,629
and that goes up to this hopper here
which is locked

820
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
which is locked
 

821
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,110
which is locked
until this uh the dropper and the

822
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
until this uh the dropper and the
 

823
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,870
until this uh the dropper and the
brewing stand are both empty and we're

824
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
brewing stand are both empty and we're
 

825
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,389
brewing stand are both empty and we're
at the end of the cycle

826
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
at the end of the cycle
 

827
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,550
at the end of the cycle
so next time we press this these items

828
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
so next time we press this these items
 

829
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,629
so next time we press this these items
should start flowing back into here

830
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
should start flowing back into here
 

831
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,990
should start flowing back into here
and preserve the order

832
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000

 

833
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,150

or is it one more oh we had one more

834
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
or is it one more oh we had one more
 

835
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,550
or is it one more oh we had one more
item in there i forgot

836
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
item in there i forgot
 

837
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,870
item in there i forgot
okay so this time we have a one one red

838
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
okay so this time we have a one one red
 

839
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,790
okay so this time we have a one one red
again

840
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
again
 

841
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,069
again
okay activate it one more time

842
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
okay activate it one more time
 

843
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,990
okay activate it one more time
and you can see they start flowing in

844
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000

 

845
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,590

so i kind of want to do a little bit

846
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
so i kind of want to do a little bit
 

847
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,189
so i kind of want to do a little bit
more building here today

848
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
more building here today
 

849
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,110
more building here today
last episode we worked on the pyramid

850
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
last episode we worked on the pyramid
 

851
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,189
last episode we worked on the pyramid
here came up with a design for it

852
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
here came up with a design for it
 

853
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,310
here came up with a design for it
and uh the word is in nobody likes it

854
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
and uh the word is in nobody likes it
 

855
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,230
and uh the word is in nobody likes it
a lot of you said it was the worst thing

856
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
a lot of you said it was the worst thing
 

857
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,990
a lot of you said it was the worst thing
i've ever built

858
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
i've ever built
 

859
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,150
i've ever built
okay i can take it i didn't take it guys

860
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
okay i can take it i didn't take it guys
 

861
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,470
okay i can take it i didn't take it guys
uh yeah it does have its flaws for sure

862
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
uh yeah it does have its flaws for sure
 

863
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,110
uh yeah it does have its flaws for sure
got some good critique on it uh too many

864
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
got some good critique on it uh too many
 

865
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,590
got some good critique on it uh too many
holes

866
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
holes
 

867
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,470
holes
kind of expected that's um too much too

868
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
kind of expected that's um too much too
 

869
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,829
kind of expected that's um too much too
much detail for

870
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
much detail for
 

871
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,350
much detail for
like as you get farther away from a

872
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
like as you get farther away from a
 

873
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,910
like as you get farther away from a
build you you need less detail right

874
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
build you you need less detail right
 

875
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,189
build you you need less detail right
and this is like like a close-up build

876
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
and this is like like a close-up build
 

877
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,949
and this is like like a close-up build
and like from this distance sure it

878
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
and like from this distance sure it
 

879
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,470
and like from this distance sure it
looks good

880
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
looks good
 

881
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,269
looks good
the way it is but from this distance no

882
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
the way it is but from this distance no
 

883
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,949
the way it is but from this distance no
no no

884
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
no no
 

885
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,550
no no
so we'll try to remove some of the

886
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
so we'll try to remove some of the
 

887
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,470
so we'll try to remove some of the
detail there's also nothing for the eye

888
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
detail there's also nothing for the eye
 

889
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,990
detail there's also nothing for the eye
to focus on which is another

890
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
to focus on which is another
 

891
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,629
to focus on which is another
issue um a lot of you said we should add

892
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
issue um a lot of you said we should add
 

893
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,310
issue um a lot of you said we should add
a golden beacon at the top i like that

894
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
a golden beacon at the top i like that
 

895
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,910
a golden beacon at the top i like that
idea we'll do that

896
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
idea we'll do that
 

897
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,430
idea we'll do that
and yeah we'll get to it in just a

898
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
and yeah we'll get to it in just a
 

899
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,629
and yeah we'll get to it in just a
second here i want to show you this

900
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
second here i want to show you this
 

901
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,189
second here i want to show you this
though

902
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
though
 

903
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,749
though
i put some trod and dirt under or or

904
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
i put some trod and dirt under or or
 

905
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,910
i put some trod and dirt under or or
path blocks they're called

906
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
path blocks they're called
 

907
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,430
path blocks they're called
under the cactus here i think that's a

908
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
under the cactus here i think that's a
 

909
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,110
under the cactus here i think that's a
cool thing right

910
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
cool thing right
 

911
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,470
cool thing right
and then i tried putting it against the

912
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
and then i tried putting it against the
 

913
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,230
and then i tried putting it against the
wall here this might be a good thing for

914
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
wall here this might be a good thing for
 

915
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,710
wall here this might be a good thing for
us to include in the sandy city

916
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
us to include in the sandy city
 

917
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,430
us to include in the sandy city
wanted to uh mess with that a little bit

918
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
wanted to uh mess with that a little bit
 

919
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,990
wanted to uh mess with that a little bit
my big

920
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
my big
 

921
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,350
my big
issue with like sand builds like this

922
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
issue with like sand builds like this
 

923
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,509
issue with like sand builds like this
is uh it's hard to mix in other types of

924
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
is uh it's hard to mix in other types of
 

925
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,629
is uh it's hard to mix in other types of
blocks and it's all

926
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
blocks and it's all
 

927
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,189
blocks and it's all
all yellow you know there's not enough

928
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
all yellow you know there's not enough
 

929
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,350
all yellow you know there's not enough
variation to it

930
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
variation to it
 

931
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,750
variation to it
um a lot of people will mix in blue and

932
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
um a lot of people will mix in blue and
 

933
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,390
um a lot of people will mix in blue and
oranges

934
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
oranges
 

935
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,069
oranges
i don't like that very much so to be

936
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
i don't like that very much so to be
 

937
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,470
i don't like that very much so to be
honest personally

938
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
honest personally
 

939
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,470
honest personally
but i kind of like this it's a brown

940
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
but i kind of like this it's a brown
 

941
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,710
but i kind of like this it's a brown
block so maybe in places we'll

942
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
block so maybe in places we'll
 

943
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,549
block so maybe in places we'll
we'll try it out here so i'm going to

944
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
we'll try it out here so i'm going to
 

945
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,390
we'll try it out here so i'm going to
put some down maybe over here

946
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400

 

947
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,669

and see what that's like just mix it in

948
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
and see what that's like just mix it in
 

949
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,110
and see what that's like just mix it in
along the wall and stuff too

950
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
along the wall and stuff too
 

951
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,070
along the wall and stuff too
probably that needs to be changed

952
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
probably that needs to be changed
 

953
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,310
probably that needs to be changed
that yeah just doing little things like

954
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
that yeah just doing little things like
 

955
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,310
that yeah just doing little things like
that in places i think will help

956
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
that in places i think will help
 

957
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,270
that in places i think will help
this place look a lot better okay very

958
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
this place look a lot better okay very
 

959
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,870
this place look a lot better okay very
cool very cool let's take a little walk

960
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
cool very cool let's take a little walk
 

961
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,909
cool very cool let's take a little walk
around here

962
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
around here
 

963
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,549
around here
so i added in some patches of this path

964
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
so i added in some patches of this path
 

965
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,350
so i added in some patches of this path
block

966
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
block
 

967
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,430
block
around sandy city here just in places

968
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
around sandy city here just in places
 

969
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,630
around sandy city here just in places
not too much

970
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
not too much
 

971
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,230
not too much
just to get a feel for it see what you

972
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
just to get a feel for it see what you
 

973
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,070
just to get a feel for it see what you
guys have to say about it

974
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
guys have to say about it
 

975
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,070
guys have to say about it
i like it in the sense that it uh breaks

976
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
i like it in the sense that it uh breaks
 

977
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,990
i like it in the sense that it uh breaks
up the ground it adds another color to

978
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
up the ground it adds another color to
 

979
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,310
up the ground it adds another color to
it

980
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
it
 

981
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,590
it
so it's not all one big glob of the same

982
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
so it's not all one big glob of the same
 

983
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,190
so it's not all one big glob of the same
thing

984
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
thing
 

985
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,190
thing
but uh i don't know if this is really

986
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
but uh i don't know if this is really
 

987
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,230
but uh i don't know if this is really
really the way to do it

988
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
really the way to do it
 

989
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,230
really the way to do it
the patches i also tried another thing

990
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
the patches i also tried another thing
 

991
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,310
the patches i also tried another thing
here where i just like

992
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
here where i just like
 

993
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,630
here where i just like
put it all along the wall because one

994
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
put it all along the wall because one
 

995
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,710
put it all along the wall because one
problem is our wall color is the same as

996
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
problem is our wall color is the same as
 

997
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,990
problem is our wall color is the same as
the ground color right

998
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
the ground color right
 

999
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,029
the ground color right
so there's no real separation

1000
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
so there's no real separation
 

1001
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,510
so there's no real separation
like when you look over over there for

1002
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
like when you look over over there for
 

1003
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,190
like when you look over over there for
example the ground and the wall

1004
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
example the ground and the wall
 

1005
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,909
example the ground and the wall
it's almost hard to tell the difference

1006
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
it's almost hard to tell the difference
 

1007
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,669
it's almost hard to tell the difference
but if you have a separation material

1008
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
but if you have a separation material
 

1009
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,590
but if you have a separation material
like this it might

1010
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
like this it might
 

1011
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,549
like this it might
be a good idea see what you guys have to

1012
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
be a good idea see what you guys have to
 

1013
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,190
be a good idea see what you guys have to
say about that

1014
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
say about that
 

1015
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,630
say about that
anyways uh another thing we did the

1016
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
anyways uh another thing we did the
 

1017
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,870
anyways uh another thing we did the
sombrero cactus last time you guys liked

1018
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
sombrero cactus last time you guys liked
 

1019
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,990
sombrero cactus last time you guys liked
it

1020
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
it
 

1021
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,909
it
uh one idea was though to change the

1022
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
uh one idea was though to change the
 

1023
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,070
uh one idea was though to change the
birchwood to a spruce wood so we'll do

1024
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
birchwood to a spruce wood so we'll do
 

1025
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,990
birchwood to a spruce wood so we'll do
that as well

1026
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
that as well
 

1027
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,990
that as well
just so that we're not using all this

1028
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
just so that we're not using all this
 

1029
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,590
just so that we're not using all this
yellow color you know the more we can

1030
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
yellow color you know the more we can
 

1031
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,029
yellow color you know the more we can
change up the colors around here the

1032
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
change up the colors around here the
 

1033
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,710
change up the colors around here the
better because it's all pretty

1034
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
better because it's all pretty
 

1035
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,710
better because it's all pretty
pretty similar yeah i like that more for

1036
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
pretty similar yeah i like that more for
 

1037
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,070
pretty similar yeah i like that more for
sure

1038
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
sure
 

1039
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,549
sure
anyways onto the pyramid here so it

1040
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
anyways onto the pyramid here so it
 

1041
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,830
anyways onto the pyramid here so it
would be great if we could mix in

1042
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
would be great if we could mix in
 

1043
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,270
would be great if we could mix in
another type of block but

1044
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
another type of block but
 

1045
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,870
another type of block but
i really have trouble finding one i like

1046
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
i really have trouble finding one i like
 

1047
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,669
i really have trouble finding one i like
i know everyone says water and lapis and

1048
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
i know everyone says water and lapis and
 

1049
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,669
i know everyone says water and lapis and
orange sand and all that

1050
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
orange sand and all that
 

1051
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,750
orange sand and all that
they just stand out so much if that was

1052
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
they just stand out so much if that was
 

1053
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,070
they just stand out so much if that was
an aqua blue it would look great

1054
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
an aqua blue it would look great
 

1055
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,549
an aqua blue it would look great
but it's a deep blue and that's like a

1056
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
but it's a deep blue and that's like a
 

1057
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,789
but it's a deep blue and that's like a
really bright orange if it was more of a

1058
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
really bright orange if it was more of a
 

1059
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,190
really bright orange if it was more of a
brownish orange it would look great but

1060
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
brownish orange it would look great but
 

1061
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,110
brownish orange it would look great but
it's not

1062
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
it's not
 

1063
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,190
it's not
how about let's try to get rid of some

1064
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
how about let's try to get rid of some
 

1065
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,110
how about let's try to get rid of some
of these holes just to begin with here

1066
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
of these holes just to begin with here
 

1067
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,110
of these holes just to begin with here
i'm thinking we do something like this

1068
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
i'm thinking we do something like this
 

1069
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,029
i'm thinking we do something like this
we bring it out or bring it forward one

1070
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
we bring it out or bring it forward one
 

1071
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,430
we bring it out or bring it forward one
block

1072
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
block
 

1073
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,470
block
and then we alternate uh stairs and

1074
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
and then we alternate uh stairs and
 

1075
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,270
and then we alternate uh stairs and
blocks

1076
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
blocks
 

1077
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,789
blocks
maybe would look good we'll try it

1078
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
maybe would look good we'll try it
 

1079
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,590
maybe would look good we'll try it
we'll try it and then we'll bring also

1080
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
we'll try it and then we'll bring also
 

1081
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,350
we'll try it and then we'll bring also
the spiky part of the wall forward a

1082
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
the spiky part of the wall forward a
 

1083
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,750
the spiky part of the wall forward a
block

1084
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760

 

1085
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,909

oh we did that one already okay let's

1086
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
oh we did that one already okay let's
 

1087
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,270
oh we did that one already okay let's
hop down check it out

1088
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
hop down check it out
 

1089
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,310
hop down check it out
okay i think it's better right it's

1090
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
okay i think it's better right it's
 

1091
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,190
okay i think it's better right it's
better

1092
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
better
 

1093
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,789
better
it needs more variation notes it's like

1094
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
it needs more variation notes it's like
 

1095
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,310
it needs more variation notes it's like
a straight line

1096
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
a straight line
 

1097
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,029
a straight line
uh maybe at this midpoint we change it

1098
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
uh maybe at this midpoint we change it
 

1099
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,990
uh maybe at this midpoint we change it
up a little bit more

1100
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
up a little bit more
 

1101
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,950
up a little bit more
do it like that okay now let's hop down

1102
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
do it like that okay now let's hop down
 

1103
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,310
do it like that okay now let's hop down
it's gonna have to make a little

1104
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
it's gonna have to make a little
 

1105
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,710
it's gonna have to make a little
adjustments yeah that's better

1106
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
adjustments yeah that's better
 

1107
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,789
adjustments yeah that's better
okay we're making more improvements do

1108
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
okay we're making more improvements do
 

1109
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,789
okay we're making more improvements do
we even need that many notches maybe we

1110
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
we even need that many notches maybe we
 

1111
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,590
we even need that many notches maybe we
don't

1112
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
don't
 

1113
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,870
don't
because i'm worried it's going to create

1114
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
because i'm worried it's going to create
 

1115
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,870
because i'm worried it's going to create
that whole effect again

1116
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
that whole effect again
 

1117
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,950
that whole effect again
if we have too many of those if we uh

1118
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
if we have too many of those if we uh
 

1119
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,270
if we have too many of those if we uh
if we do more of an arch instead like if

1120
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
if we do more of an arch instead like if
 

1121
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,789
if we do more of an arch instead like if
that's a stair

1122
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
that's a stair
 

1123
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,149
that's a stair
and this is a stair

1124
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
and this is a stair
 

1125
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,950
and this is a stair
it'll be a little bit smoother that way

1126
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960

 

1127
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,110

okay a little bit weird because we have

1128
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
okay a little bit weird because we have
 

1129
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,230
okay a little bit weird because we have
that arch

1130
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
that arch
 

1131
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,190
that arch
there it looks like it's offset now

1132
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
there it looks like it's offset now
 

1133
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,270
there it looks like it's offset now
right

1134
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
right
 

1135
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,430
right
so i redid the second layer there now

1136
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
so i redid the second layer there now
 

1137
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,870
so i redid the second layer there now
and i think it looks a lot better

1138
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
and i think it looks a lot better
 

1139
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,630
and i think it looks a lot better
right still might need a few more

1140
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
right still might need a few more
 

1141
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,630
right still might need a few more
adjustments but it's an improvement i

1142
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
adjustments but it's an improvement i
 

1143
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,430
adjustments but it's an improvement i
think

1144
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
think
 

1145
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,990
think
i'm going to try to widen those arches

1146
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
i'm going to try to widen those arches
 

1147
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,710
i'm going to try to widen those arches
that

1148
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
that
 

1149
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,789
that
inside one there to match more of the

1150
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
inside one there to match more of the
 

1151
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,750
inside one there to match more of the
outside

1152
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
outside
 

1153
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,789
outside
shape uh i centered them which helps a

1154
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
shape uh i centered them which helps a
 

1155
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,510
shape uh i centered them which helps a
lot but i think

1156
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
lot but i think
 

1157
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,270
lot but i think
if we made it wider it might look cool

1158
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
if we made it wider it might look cool
 

1159
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,110
if we made it wider it might look cool
too

1160
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
too
 

1161
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,390
too
you know what we have a little bit of a

1162
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
you know what we have a little bit of a
 

1163
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,230
you know what we have a little bit of a
hard call here now because i did that

1164
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
hard call here now because i did that
 

1165
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,190
hard call here now because i did that
and i think it looks worse maybe because

1166
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
and i think it looks worse maybe because
 

1167
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,270
and i think it looks worse maybe because
we only did the two

1168
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
we only did the two
 

1169
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,630
we only did the two
and it'll look better once we change

1170
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
and it'll look better once we change
 

1171
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,070
and it'll look better once we change
more of the pyramid but i think i'm just

1172
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
more of the pyramid but i think i'm just
 

1173
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,270
more of the pyramid but i think i'm just
going to go back to

1174
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
going to go back to
 

1175
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,669
going to go back to
the the thinner ones right

1176
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679

 

1177
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,350

all right so we went back to the thinner

1178
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
all right so we went back to the thinner
 

1179
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,870
all right so we went back to the thinner
arches again

1180
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
arches again
 

1181
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,990
arches again
i've kind of gone through the whole

1182
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
i've kind of gone through the whole
 

1183
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,909
i've kind of gone through the whole
pyramid now with with some of these

1184
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
pyramid now with with some of these
 

1185
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,549
pyramid now with with some of these
changes

1186
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
changes
 

1187
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,470
changes
i've also added birch leaves at every

1188
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
i've also added birch leaves at every
 

1189
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,669
i've also added birch leaves at every
layer which help

1190
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
layer which help
 

1191
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,149
layer which help
to add to the separation between the

1192
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
to add to the separation between the
 

1193
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,669
to add to the separation between the
layers i think

1194
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
layers i think
 

1195
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,390
layers i think
um still a lot of holes is it too many

1196
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
um still a lot of holes is it too many
 

1197
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
um still a lot of holes is it too many
still

1198
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
still
 

1199
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,510
still
i'm not sure i kind of liked having the

1200
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
i'm not sure i kind of liked having the
 

1201
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,990
i'm not sure i kind of liked having the
bottom with all the holes

1202
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
bottom with all the holes
 

1203
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,310
bottom with all the holes
and then the other layers they're broken

1204
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
and then the other layers they're broken
 

1205
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,430
and then the other layers they're broken
up quite a bit more

1206
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
up quite a bit more
 

1207
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,789
up quite a bit more
and you can see there's a bit of a

1208
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
and you can see there's a bit of a
 

1209
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,149
and you can see there's a bit of a
pattern to it how it does a triangle

1210
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
pattern to it how it does a triangle
 

1211
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,310
pattern to it how it does a triangle
and then we have that tower there in the

1212
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
and then we have that tower there in the
 

1213
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,070
and then we have that tower there in the
middle and over there i think we should

1214
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
middle and over there i think we should
 

1215
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,149
middle and over there i think we should
get rid of that and maybe put in an

1216
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
get rid of that and maybe put in an
 

1217
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,590
get rid of that and maybe put in an
entrance like an arch archway entrance

1218
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
entrance like an arch archway entrance
 

1219
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,710
entrance like an arch archway entrance
would look cool

1220
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720

 

1221
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,630

yeah okay if we make a entrance to the

1222
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
yeah okay if we make a entrance to the
 

1223
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,070
yeah okay if we make a entrance to the
pyramid over here there is actually a

1224
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
pyramid over here there is actually a
 

1225
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,669
pyramid over here there is actually a
little bit of space here we could

1226
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
little bit of space here we could
 

1227
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,870
little bit of space here we could
build inside so that's good i think what

1228
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
build inside so that's good i think what
 

1229
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,310
build inside so that's good i think what
i'm going to try to do is build it out

1230
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
i'm going to try to do is build it out
 

1231
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,310
i'm going to try to do is build it out
of dark oak

1232
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
of dark oak
 

1233
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,390
of dark oak
like so we'll take up the space of the

1234
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
like so we'll take up the space of the
 

1235
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,230
like so we'll take up the space of the
the tower we ripped out

1236
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
the tower we ripped out
 

1237
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,270
the tower we ripped out
put another one over here and then we'll

1238
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
put another one over here and then we'll
 

1239
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,710
put another one over here and then we'll
start arching this

1240
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
start arching this
 

1241
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,630
start arching this
uh together and just see what that looks

1242
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
uh together and just see what that looks
 

1243
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,990
uh together and just see what that looks
like uh

1244
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
like uh
 

1245
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,510
like uh
we might need to oh actually that's

1246
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
we might need to oh actually that's
 

1247
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,029
we might need to oh actually that's
that's getting pretty tall these layers

1248
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
that's getting pretty tall these layers
 

1249
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,669
that's getting pretty tall these layers
are pretty cramped together

1250
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
are pretty cramped together
 

1251
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,510
are pretty cramped together
not the best design um

1252
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
not the best design um
 

1253
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,630
not the best design um
i don't know about this well we'll try

1254
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
i don't know about this well we'll try
 

1255
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,830
i don't know about this well we'll try
it out we'll try it out

1256
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
it out we'll try it out
 

1257
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,950
it out we'll try it out
okay and then i just let's just do this

1258
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
okay and then i just let's just do this
 

1259
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,230
okay and then i just let's just do this
right now just to see what that would

1260
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
right now just to see what that would
 

1261
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,230
right now just to see what that would
look like from the ground

1262
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240

 

1263
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,990

uh-huh okay let's just try this for

1264
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
uh-huh okay let's just try this for
 

1265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,230
uh-huh okay let's just try this for
right now

1266
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
right now
 

1267
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,350
right now
this will be opened up it's gonna look

1268
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
this will be opened up it's gonna look
 

1269
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,590
this will be opened up it's gonna look
really funny

1270
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
really funny
 

1271
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,789
really funny
i know it already

1272
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799

 

1273
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,230

yep pretty funny yeah i think it's gonna

1274
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
yep pretty funny yeah i think it's gonna
 

1275
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,070
yep pretty funny yeah i think it's gonna
look better here if we put sandstone in

1276
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
look better here if we put sandstone in
 

1277
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,590
look better here if we put sandstone in
front of the the wood here

1278
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
front of the the wood here
 

1279
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,190
front of the the wood here
so we'll try that out i'm going to

1280
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
so we'll try that out i'm going to
 

1281
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,950
so we'll try that out i'm going to
replace this dark oak with spruce though

1282
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
replace this dark oak with spruce though
 

1283
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,470
replace this dark oak with spruce though
that way it's a little bit more of a

1284
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
that way it's a little bit more of a
 

1285
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,230
that way it's a little bit more of a
continuation and

1286
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
continuation and
 

1287
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,830
continuation and
in front of this we should probably put

1288
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
in front of this we should probably put
 

1289
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,870
in front of this we should probably put
some sandstone

1290
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880

 

1291
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,710

okay and i lowered it by one as well

1292
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
okay and i lowered it by one as well
 

1293
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,909
okay and i lowered it by one as well
which i think is important because it

1294
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
which i think is important because it
 

1295
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,710
which i think is important because it
was

1296
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
was
 

1297
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,430
was
it was too tall otherwise is it this

1298
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
it was too tall otherwise is it this
 

1299
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,350
it was too tall otherwise is it this
isn't necessarily like an entrance into

1300
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
isn't necessarily like an entrance into
 

1301
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,390
isn't necessarily like an entrance into
the building it might just be like

1302
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
the building it might just be like
 

1303
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,669
the building it might just be like
somewhere you come out of the building

1304
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
somewhere you come out of the building
 

1305
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,630
somewhere you come out of the building
to look down on

1306
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
to look down on
 

1307
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,310
to look down on
on the people's uh but we may eventually

1308
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
on the people's uh but we may eventually
 

1309
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,110
on the people's uh but we may eventually
put us

1310
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
put us
 

1311
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,430
put us
a staircase to go down i don't really

1312
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
a staircase to go down i don't really
 

1313
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,870
a staircase to go down i don't really
want to though because we got the wall

1314
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
want to though because we got the wall
 

1315
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,149
want to though because we got the wall
down there and we also have the reed

1316
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
down there and we also have the reed
 

1317
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,350
down there and we also have the reed
field there

1318
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
field there
 

1319
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,470
field there
which i would like to keep

1320
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
which i would like to keep
 

1321
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,350
which i would like to keep
oh that's the floor from the next level

1322
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360

 

1323
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,990

okay let's look now again a lot of like

1324
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
okay let's look now again a lot of like
 

1325
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,230
okay let's look now again a lot of like
jumping down and checking it out

1326
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240

 

1327
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,149

i don't know about that should we keep

1328
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
i don't know about that should we keep
 

1329

viewing it from
if we're flying let's see if we can take

1342
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
if we're flying let's see if we can take
 

1343
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,830
if we're flying let's see if we can take
off here

1344
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
off here
 

1345
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,350
off here
actually i'll just i'll just under pearl

1346
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
actually i'll just i'll just under pearl
 

1347
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,029
actually i'll just i'll just under pearl
up it's easier

1348
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
up it's easier
 

1349
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,549
up it's easier
yeah if we're flying this pyramid is

1350
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
yeah if we're flying this pyramid is
 

1351
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,310
yeah if we're flying this pyramid is
going to look a lot better if we're up

1352
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
going to look a lot better if we're up
 

1353
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,070
going to look a lot better if we're up
from some higher ground because the

1354
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
from some higher ground because the
 

1355
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,750
from some higher ground because the
layers separate a lot better

1356
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
layers separate a lot better
 

1357
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,990
layers separate a lot better
