comment suggestion is that i should
 

35
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,790
comment suggestion is that i should
put snow where the leaves are and then

36
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
put snow where the leaves are and then
 

37
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,389
put snow where the leaves are and then
fill in like a circle with all the

38
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
fill in like a circle with all the
 

39
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,709
fill in like a circle with all the
all the transparent space with ice so

40
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
all the transparent space with ice so
 

41
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,350
all the transparent space with ice so
like that would be ice that would be ice

42
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
like that would be ice that would be ice
 

43
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,430
like that would be ice that would be ice
that would be ice that would be ice and

44
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
that would be ice that would be ice and
 

45
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,229
that would be ice that would be ice and
all the leaf stuff would be snow

46
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
all the leaf stuff would be snow
 

47
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,069
all the leaf stuff would be snow
i think that'll look really good and

48
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
i think that'll look really good and
 

49
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,750
i think that'll look really good and
then they'll give me a full platform up

50
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
then they'll give me a full platform up
 

51
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,830
then they'll give me a full platform up
there to walk around and look at

52
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
there to walk around and look at
 

53
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,870
there to walk around and look at
and look at the terrain so to start out

54
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
and look at the terrain so to start out
 

55
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,270
and look at the terrain so to start out
with i have some snow harvested

56
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
with i have some snow harvested
 

57
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,750
with i have some snow harvested
and we'll start laying that down i'll do

58
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
and we'll start laying that down i'll do
 

59
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,030
and we'll start laying that down i'll do
that off camera

60
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
that off camera
 

61
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,350
that off camera
and again we'll have to wait to 1.3 to

62
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
and again we'll have to wait to 1.3 to
 

63
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,710
and again we'll have to wait to 1.3 to
do the ice parts to fill in the cracks

64
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
do the ice parts to fill in the cracks
 

65
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,710
do the ice parts to fill in the cracks
but it sounds like 1.3 is just around

66
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
but it sounds like 1.3 is just around
 

67
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,870
but it sounds like 1.3 is just around
the corner like any day

68
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
the corner like any day
 

69
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,789
the corner like any day
maybe even by the time this episode goes

70
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
maybe even by the time this episode goes
 

71
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,149
maybe even by the time this episode goes
up who knows

72
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
up who knows
 

73
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,749
up who knows
so shouldn't have to wait too long to do

74
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
so shouldn't have to wait too long to do
 

75
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,550
so shouldn't have to wait too long to do
that

76
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
that
 

77
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,630
that
and also uh we might do some

78
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
and also uh we might do some
 

79
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,749
and also uh we might do some
some stuff around the landscape like

80
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
some stuff around the landscape like
 

81
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,310
some stuff around the landscape like
add some more glowing trees and maybe

82
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
add some more glowing trees and maybe
 

83
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,789
add some more glowing trees and maybe
plant some stuff in the mountains

84
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
plant some stuff in the mountains
 

85
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,710
plant some stuff in the mountains

88
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
didn't really know what to do with it
 

89
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,870
didn't really know what to do with it
some people suggested i should build

90
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
some people suggested i should build
 

91
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,710
some people suggested i should build
some pyramids

92
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
some pyramids
 

93
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,830
some pyramids
which could be cool to have a few of

94
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
which could be cool to have a few of
 

95
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,469
which could be cool to have a few of
those uh

96
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
those uh
 

97
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,230
those uh

00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
you know i've never built a pyramid in
 

99
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,670
you know i've never built a pyramid in
minecraft before that's

100
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680

 

101
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,350

which is it's kind of crazy because

102
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
which is it's kind of crazy because
 

103
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,270
which is it's kind of crazy because
that's like the second thing people

104
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
that's like the second thing people
 

105
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,670
that's like the second thing people
build

106
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
build
 

107
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,190
build
in the game first they build their

108
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
in the game first they build their
 

109
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,870
in the game first they build their
wooden house and the next thing they

110
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
wooden house and the next thing they
 

111
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,190
wooden house and the next thing they
build is like a pyramid

112
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
build is like a pyramid
 

113
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,070
build is like a pyramid
it seems like that's i remember seeing

114
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
it seems like that's i remember seeing
 

115
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,430
it seems like that's i remember seeing
so many videos about

116
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
so many videos about
 

117
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,589
so many videos about
people building the tallest pyramid in

118
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
people building the tallest pyramid in
 

119
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,470
people building the tallest pyramid in
the game

120
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
the game
 

121
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,150
the game
um possible like the full 128 and

122
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
um possible like the full 128 and
 

123
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,589
um possible like the full 128 and
and now there's probably videos of the

124
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
and now there's probably videos of the
 

125
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,510
and now there's probably videos of the
256 and

126
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
256 and
 

127
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,190
256 and
because it's such a simple thing to

128
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
because it's such a simple thing to
 

129
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,869
because it's such a simple thing to
build

130
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
build
 

131
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,150
build
um so we might do pyramids but a great

132
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
um so we might do pyramids but a great
 

133
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,390
um so we might do pyramids but a great
idea i got is to make an oasis in the

134
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
idea i got is to make an oasis in the
 

135
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,990
idea i got is to make an oasis in the
desert

136
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
desert
 

137
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,710
desert
and that could be cool that could be a

138
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
and that could be cool that could be a
 

139
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,750
and that could be cool that could be a
lot of fun

140
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
lot of fun
 

141
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,750
lot of fun
anyway i'm gonna do the snowflake i'll

142
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
anyway i'm gonna do the snowflake i'll
 

143
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,070
anyway i'm gonna do the snowflake i'll
get back to you in a little bit

144
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080

 

145
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,750

yeah here's a good perspective of the

146
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
yeah here's a good perspective of the
 

147
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,509
yeah here's a good perspective of the
glowing tree numbers uh

148
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
glowing tree numbers uh
 

149
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,030
glowing tree numbers uh
we got quite a few here but

150
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
we got quite a few here but
 

151
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,550
we got quite a few here but
uh like all that back there that would

152
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
uh like all that back there that would
 

153
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,030
uh like all that back there that would
be cool if that was all glowing trees

154
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
be cool if that was all glowing trees
 

155
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,390
be cool if that was all glowing trees
and

156
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400

 

157
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,190

and that stuff there so i'll work on

158
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
and that stuff there so i'll work on
 

159
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,390
and that stuff there so i'll work on
that a little bit today too but i'm just

160
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
that a little bit today too but i'm just
 

161
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,509
that a little bit today too but i'm just
going to go underneath

162
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
going to go underneath
 

163
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,309
going to go underneath
the leaf stuff here i guess i should go

164
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319

 

165
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,110

maybe i'll go that far down

166
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120

 

167
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,550

168
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
making myself some scaffolding
 

169
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,309
making myself some scaffolding

170
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
to walk on and i'm just going to go
 

171
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,910

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
underneath all this
 

173
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,589

and put that put snow underneath
and that should be fairly easy because

176
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
and that should be fairly easy because
 

177
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,869
and that should be fairly easy because
we got the shape all laid out

178
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
we got the shape all laid out
 

179
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:40,149

i'll probably leave it pointed on the
edges instead of doing the circle like i

218
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
edges instead of doing the circle like i
 

219

and then we will start decorating our
 

257
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,670

341
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,589
computer seems to be doing it too
but thankfully it stopped after a few

i i swig wiggle potion real quick
 

513
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,990
i i swig wiggle potion real quick
i want to get rid of the item slot i'll

514
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
i want to get rid of the item slot i'll
 

515
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,069
i want to get rid of the item slot i'll
just press q and toss it

516
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
just press q and toss it
 

517
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,750
just press q and toss it
so it frees up the spot but

518
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
so it frees up the spot but
 

519
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,069
so it frees up the spot but
if you have that key far away it can be

520
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
if you have that key far away it can be
 

521
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,030
if you have that key far away it can be
a challenge

522
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
a challenge
 

523
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,230
a challenge
to press it

524
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240

 

525
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,069

okay now let's see should we do the

526
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
okay now let's see should we do the
 

527
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,629
okay now let's see should we do the
trees

528
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
trees
 

529
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,670
trees
or should we well one thing i definitely

530
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
or should we well one thing i definitely
 

531
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,230
or should we well one thing i definitely
wanted to

532
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
wanted to
 

533
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,509
wanted to
do today is hook up the other portal to

534
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
do today is hook up the other portal to
 

535
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,150
do today is hook up the other portal to
the other base so what i'm gonna have to

536
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
the other base so what i'm gonna have to
 

537
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,590
the other base so what i'm gonna have to
do is go there get the coordinates

538
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
do is go there get the coordinates
 

539
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,430
do is go there get the coordinates
then go to the nether and make a portal

540
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
then go to the nether and make a portal
 

541
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,829
then go to the nether and make a portal
for it so we'll we'll do that next

542
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
for it so we'll we'll do that next
 

543
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,949
for it so we'll we'll do that next
okay can we make this jump

544
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
okay can we make this jump
 

545
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,310
okay can we make this jump
what do you think if we don't

546
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
what do you think if we don't
 

547
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,590
what do you think if we don't
we might survive anyway nope can't make

548
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
we might survive anyway nope can't make
 

549
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,550
we might survive anyway nope can't make
it

550
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
it
 

551
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,670
it
uh oh

552
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680

 

553
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,829

i threw a i threw a pearl i don't think

554
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
i threw a i threw a pearl i don't think
 

555
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,190
i threw a i threw a pearl i don't think
it teleported me

556
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
it teleported me
 

557
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,829
it teleported me
all right guys here we are i do have

558
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
all right guys here we are i do have
 

559
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,949
all right guys here we are i do have
another portal here already

560
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
another portal here already
 

561
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,509
another portal here already
something i just put out of the way

562
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
something i just put out of the way
 

563
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,430
something i just put out of the way
we're going to try connect to it

564
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
we're going to try connect to it
 

565
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,590
we're going to try connect to it
and maybe in the future move it

566
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
and maybe in the future move it
 

567
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,710
and maybe in the future move it
but i built this one on this side like i

568
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
but i built this one on this side like i
 

569
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,670
but i built this one on this side like i
didn't build it in the nether

570
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
didn't build it in the nether
 

571
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,990
didn't build it in the nether
and it takes me to my main nether portal

572
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
and it takes me to my main nether portal
 

573
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,990
and it takes me to my main nether portal
which then takes me somewhere else if i

574
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
which then takes me somewhere else if i
 

575
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,670
which then takes me somewhere else if i
go through it again so

576
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
go through it again so
 

577
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,990
go through it again so
i think to connect to this one i need to

578
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
i think to connect to this one i need to
 

579
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,949
i think to connect to this one i need to
build the portal actually in the nether

580
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
build the portal actually in the nether
 

581
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,670
build the portal actually in the nether
and divide my coordinates here by eight

582
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
and divide my coordinates here by eight
 

583
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,470
and divide my coordinates here by eight
so we're

584
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
so we're
 

585
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,790
so we're
about negative 472.

586
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
about negative 472.
 

587
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,550
about negative 472.
where is that spider y

588
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
where is that spider y
 

589
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,150
where is that spider y
23 and zed

590
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160

 

591
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,430

8 18. would you have to divide

592
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
8 18. would you have to divide
 

593
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,110
8 18. would you have to divide
y by eight i wonder that would be at the

594
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
y by eight i wonder that would be at the
 

595
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,310
y by eight i wonder that would be at the
bottom of the world right

596
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320

 

597
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,430

no you must not have to divide y just x

598
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
no you must not have to divide y just x
 

599
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,870
no you must not have to divide y just x
and z

600
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
and z
 

601
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,710
and z
okay so

602
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
okay so
 

603
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,670
okay so
let's get somewhere safe i'll do the

604
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
let's get somewhere safe i'll do the
 

605
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,069
let's get somewhere safe i'll do the
math

606
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
math
 

607
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,430
math
and we'll figure out where we have to

608
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
and we'll figure out where we have to
 

609
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,030
and we'll figure out where we have to
put it

610
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040

 

611
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,629

okay it works out that the portal should

612
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
okay it works out that the portal should
 

613
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,150
okay it works out that the portal should
go here negative

614
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
go here negative
 

615
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,069
go here negative
59 x and 102 zed

616
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
59 x and 102 zed
 

617
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,750
59 x and 102 zed
but i checked the wiki to see what it

618
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
but i checked the wiki to see what it
 

619
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,350
but i checked the wiki to see what it
had to say about it

620
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
had to say about it
 

621
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,069
had to say about it
and apparently i always thought that the

622
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
and apparently i always thought that the
 

623
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,910
and apparently i always thought that the
nether portals got linked in this game

624
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
nether portals got linked in this game
 

625
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,790
nether portals got linked in this game
but they don't

626
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
but they don't
 

627
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,829
but they don't
it's all based on their position

628
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
it's all based on their position
 

629
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,550
it's all based on their position
i guess it checks it every time and

630
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560

 

631
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,350

there is a 257 by 257

632
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
there is a 257 by 257
 

633
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,550
there is a 257 by 257
by 128 box that gets

634
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
by 128 box that gets
 

635
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,710
by 128 box that gets
checked centered around the player for a

636
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
checked centered around the player for a
 

637
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,829
checked centered around the player for a
portal

638
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
portal
 

639
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,230
portal
and whatever portal is closest to that

640
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
and whatever portal is closest to that
 

641
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,590
and whatever portal is closest to that
is the one

642
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600

 

643
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,550

that gets chosen

644
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
that gets chosen
 

645
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,150
that gets chosen
yeah i always forget to bring a bow

646
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160

 

647
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,910

um so that works out

648
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
um so that works out
 

649
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,110
um so that works out
to being an eight block leeway

650
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
to being an eight block leeway
 

651
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,870
to being an eight block leeway
in the nether i have because

652
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
in the nether i have because
 

653
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,790
in the nether i have because
every block in that nether counts is

654
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
every block in that nether counts is
 

655
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,030
every block in that nether counts is
eight in the overworld

656
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040

 

657
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,189

he's so annoying so

658
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
he's so annoying so
 

659
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,870
he's so annoying so
i can put it over

660
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
i can put it over
 

661
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,990
i can put it over
where were we 59 102

662
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
where were we 59 102
 

663
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,870
where were we 59 102
i could move up to eight blocks this way

664
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
i could move up to eight blocks this way
 

665
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,829
i could move up to eight blocks this way
or this way or this way the y doesn't

666
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
or this way or this way the y doesn't
 

667
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,269
or this way or this way the y doesn't
matter

668
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
matter
 

669
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,069
matter
so if i put it here it should work from

670
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
so if i put it here it should work from
 

671
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,870
so if i put it here it should work from
what i understand anyway

672
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880

 

673
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,629

not something i'll have a lot of

674
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
not something i'll have a lot of
 

675
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,470
not something i'll have a lot of
experience with don't make nether

676
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
experience with don't make nether
 

677
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,110
experience with don't make nether
portals all that often

678
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
portals all that often
 

679
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,110
portals all that often
unfortunately if i do this though i'd
