areas aren't lit up now too but we're
 

169
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,620
areas aren't lit up now too but we're
going to work on on the water system

170
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:09,630
going to work on on the water system
 

171
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,110
going to work on on the water system
today anyway so what I'll do here first

172
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,120
today anyway so what I'll do here first

all right there we go so now we'll set
up our boat elevator and we'll do the

180
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:40,730
up our boat elevator and we'll do the
 

181
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,320
up our boat elevator and we'll do the
new style with the glass panes so it's

182
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,330
new style with the glass panes so it's
 

183
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:56,800
new style with the glass panes so it's
just a 3x3 type thing let's see that I

184
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:56,810
just a 3x3 type thing let's see that I
 

185
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,620
just a 3x3 type thing let's see that I
might remove some of some more of this

186
00:05:59,620 --> 00:05:59,630
might remove some of some more of this
 

187
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,940
might remove some of some more of this
cliff because it doesn't look as good

188
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:00,950
cliff because it doesn't look as good
 

189
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,230
cliff because it doesn't look as good
when the glass connects like that the

190
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,240
when the glass connects like that the
 

191
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,690
when the glass connects like that the
yeah I just gotta go all the way up

yeah I just gotta go all the way up
 

193
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,090
yeah I just gotta go all the way up
doing this and then fill in the center

194
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,100
doing this and then fill in the center
 

195
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:34,580
doing this and then fill in the center
oops with water

196
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,590

 

197
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:56,020

okay

198
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,030

 

199
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,540

whoa-ho-ho

200

whoa-ho-ho
 

201
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:20,410
whoa-ho-ho
did not mean to - they're all done

202
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:20,420
did not mean to - they're all done
 

203
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,060
did not mean to - they're all done
actually took a lot of glass more than I

204
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,070
actually took a lot of glass more than I
 

205
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,370
actually took a lot of glass more than I
was expecting there it is it goes oh

206
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,380
was expecting there it is it goes oh
 

207
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,340
was expecting there it is it goes oh
it's probably 20 blocks high or so and

208
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,350
it's probably 20 blocks high or so and
 

209
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,920
it's probably 20 blocks high or so and
now we just need to fill it with water

210
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:32,930
now we just need to fill it with water
 

211
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,630
now we just need to fill it with water
I'm I don't know what would look best

212
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm I don't know what would look best
 

213
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm I don't know what would look best
but I think I'll just put signs up here

214
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,430
but I think I'll just put signs up here
 

215
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,610
but I think I'll just put signs up here
for now to hold the water in place kind

216
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:43,620
for now to hold the water in place kind
 

217
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,000
for now to hold the water in place kind
of looks weird yes but just for now

218
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,010
of looks weird yes but just for now
 

219
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,120
of looks weird yes but just for now
anyway we'll figure something out and we

220
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,130
anyway we'll figure something out and we
 

221
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,660
anyway we'll figure something out and we
just place water all the way up got two

222
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:56,670
just place water all the way up got two
 

223
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:02,010
just place water all the way up got two
more buckets with me

224
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,020

 

225
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,740

yeah so what can we talk about while we

226
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:07,750
yeah so what can we talk about while we
 

227
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,810
yeah so what can we talk about while we
do this I did kind of announce that I'm

228
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:12,820
do this I did kind of announce that I'm
 

229
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,770
do this I did kind of announce that I'm
doing a survival map now I started

230
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:16,780
doing a survival map now I started
 

231
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,460
doing a survival map now I started
working on it having fun doing that

232
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:19,470
working on it having fun doing that
 

233
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,620
working on it having fun doing that
there's going to be a lot of traps guys

234
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:22,630
there's going to be a lot of traps guys
 

235
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,480
there's going to be a lot of traps guys
a lot of traps I wasn't really sure how

236
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,490
a lot of traps I wasn't really sure how
 

237
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,580
a lot of traps I wasn't really sure how
many I was going to do at first but you

238
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:29,590
many I was going to do at first but you
 

239
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,500
many I was going to do at first but you
know they just keep coming to me so I'm

240
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:31,510
know they just keep coming to me so I'm
 

241
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,900
know they just keep coming to me so I'm
guessing there's going to be a lot of

242
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:33,910
guessing there's going to be a lot of
 

243
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,120
guessing there's going to be a lot of
traps throughout the whole map I keep

244
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,130
traps throughout the whole map I keep
 

245
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,190
traps throughout the whole map I keep
coming up with some pretty creative

246
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,200
coming up with some pretty creative
 

247
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,450
coming up with some pretty creative
ideas for traps it's like yeah one of

248
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:42,460
ideas for traps it's like yeah one of
 

249
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,640
ideas for traps it's like yeah one of
those things I have a knack for I think

250
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:46,650

 

251
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,130

should be a lot of fun if you don't mind

252
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,140
should be a lot of fun if you don't mind
 

253
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,670
should be a lot of fun if you don't mind
dying all the time it'll probably take

254
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:56,680
dying all the time it'll probably take
 

255
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,530
dying all the time it'll probably take
me forever to finish the map though if I

256
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,540
me forever to finish the map though if I
 

257
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,660
me forever to finish the map though if I
do ever finish it - hopefully I do it's

258
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:03,670
do ever finish it - hopefully I do it's
 

259
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,540
do ever finish it - hopefully I do it's
going to be a lot like vex super hostile

260
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,550
going to be a lot like vex super hostile
 

261
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,970
going to be a lot like vex super hostile
series that's what it's inspired from

262
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:08,980
series that's what it's inspired from
 

263
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,610
series that's what it's inspired from
but obviously it'll have my own style to

264
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:11,620
but obviously it'll have my own style to
 

265
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,830
but obviously it'll have my own style to
it I don't want to copy him directly or

266
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:13,840
it I don't want to copy him directly or
 

267
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,780
it I don't want to copy him directly or
anything like that going to be a lot of

268
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:17,790
anything like that going to be a lot of
 

269
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,360
anything like that going to be a lot of
mechanisms and it's lots of Pistons

270
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,370
mechanisms and it's lots of Pistons
 

271
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:30,150
mechanisms and it's lots of Pistons
stuff should be cool okay so now we just

272
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
stuff should be cool okay so now we just
 

273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,040
stuff should be cool okay so now we just
need like a pool that we can drive our

274
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,050
need like a pool that we can drive our
 

275
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,420
need like a pool that we can drive our
boats into here to test it out so I'll

276
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:36,430
boats into here to test it out so I'll
 

277
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,610
boats into here to test it out so I'll
do that and then we'll try it no no no

278
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:41,620
do that and then we'll try it no no no
 

279
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,350
do that and then we'll try it no no no
it's going to work man you just you just

280
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
it's going to work man you just you just
 

281
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,720
it's going to work man you just you just
kind of imagine it a little bit you'll

282
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:45,730
kind of imagine it a little bit you'll
 

283
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,720
kind of imagine it a little bit you'll
come up with your boat and then they'll

284
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,730
come up with your boat and then they'll
 

285
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,230
come up with your boat and then they'll
be like a lake up here with rivers and

286
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
be like a lake up here with rivers and
 

287
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,140
be like a lake up here with rivers and
stuff on the surface everything will be

288
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,150
stuff on the surface everything will be
 

289
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,160
stuff on the surface everything will be
accessible by boat it's my dream I'm

290
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,170
accessible by boat it's my dream I'm
 

291
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,070
accessible by boat it's my dream I'm
going to make it happen you'll see and

292
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,080
going to make it happen you'll see and
 

293
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,260
going to make it happen you'll see and
then it'll work trust me what we'll do

294
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,270
then it'll work trust me what we'll do
 

295
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,470
then it'll work trust me what we'll do
is we'll have a like a free drop here -

296
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
is we'll have a like a free drop here -
 

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,110
is we'll have a like a free drop here -
for getting down so from the lake

for getting down so from the lake
 

299
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,180
for getting down so from the lake
there'll be a free drop to a lake below

300
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,190
there'll be a free drop to a lake below
 

301
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,790
there'll be a free drop to a lake below
the

302
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
the
 

303
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,720
the
we'll not late but a pool of water below

304
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:18,730
we'll not late but a pool of water below
 

305
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,790
we'll not late but a pool of water below
and that's how you'll get down this is

306
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:21,800
and that's how you'll get down this is
 

307
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,850
and that's how you'll get down this is
just for coming up and it should work

308
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:24,860
just for coming up and it should work

00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:51,669
able to steer your boat into here no
problem I'll take you up up here and

320
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:51,679
problem I'll take you up up here and
 

321
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,439
problem I'll take you up up here and
then there'll be a lake or something to

322
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:53,449
then there'll be a lake or something to
 

323
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,600
then there'll be a lake or something to
connect to is the plan

324
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,610

 

325
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:03,120

in front of you somewhere

326
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,130

 

327
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,020

uh-huh anyway ah I'm going to take a

328
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,030
uh-huh anyway ah I'm going to take a
 

329
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,190
uh-huh anyway ah I'm going to take a
little break from this maybe y'all

330
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
little break from this maybe y'all
 

331
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,990
little break from this maybe y'all
rehaul out the slime farm or something

332
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000

 

333
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,560

cool slime farms back then take long to

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,570
cool slime farms back then take long to
 

335
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,620
cool slime farms back then take long to
remake and it's almost exactly the same

336
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:25,630

 

337
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,220

so apparently you can use your sword now

338
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,230
so apparently you can use your sword now
 

339
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,140
so apparently you can use your sword now
to get slime balls from these guys which

340
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,150
to get slime balls from these guys which
 

341
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,580
to get slime balls from these guys which
is cool and we have six slime balls what

342
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:39,590
is cool and we have six slime balls what
 

343
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,100
is cool and we have six slime balls what
can we do with six slime balls hmm maybe

344
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,110
can we do with six slime balls hmm maybe
 

345
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,160
can we do with six slime balls hmm maybe
we'll try make a mushroom farm or

346
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,170
we'll try make a mushroom farm or
 

347
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,230
we'll try make a mushroom farm or
something I worked on that wheat and cow

348
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,240
something I worked on that wheat and cow
 

349
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,320
something I worked on that wheat and cow
farm too and I got a fair bit done

350
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,330
farm too and I got a fair bit done
 

351
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,220
farm too and I got a fair bit done
staying closer to the way it was

352
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,230
staying closer to the way it was
 

353
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,440
staying closer to the way it was
probably won't take me long to recover

354
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,450
probably won't take me long to recover
 

355
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:09,900
probably won't take me long to recover
from this loss ah one nice thing I died

356
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:09,910
from this loss ah one nice thing I died
 

357
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,240
from this loss ah one nice thing I died
before when I had a ton of stuff on me I

358
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,250
before when I had a ton of stuff on me I
 

359
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,300
before when I had a ton of stuff on me I
got from taming so now I have a second

360
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,310
got from taming so now I have a second
 

361
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,250
got from taming so now I have a second
chance of getting that stuff again

362
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,260
chance of getting that stuff again
 

363
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,720
chance of getting that stuff again
without dying so there's some benefits

364
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:22,730
without dying so there's some benefits
 

365
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,650
without dying so there's some benefits
to having to resort to my backup here

366
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:28,660

 

367
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,850

yeah so I think I'm going to try make

368
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:30,860
yeah so I think I'm going to try make
 

369
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,120
yeah so I think I'm going to try make
some mushroom farms here just very

370
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,130
some mushroom farms here just very
 

371
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,940
some mushroom farms here just very
simple ones I know you can get mushrooms

372
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:36,950
simple ones I know you can get mushrooms
 

373
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,810
simple ones I know you can get mushrooms
by harvesting the giant mushrooms that

374
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:40,820
by harvesting the giant mushrooms that
 

375
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,720
by harvesting the giant mushrooms that
you grow with bone meal net but I'm

376
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:43,730
you grow with bone meal net but I'm
 

377
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,400
you grow with bone meal net but I'm
going to try make the old-style

378
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,410
going to try make the old-style
 

379
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,710
going to try make the old-style
mushroom farms even though they're nerf

380
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:47,720
mushroom farms even though they're nerf
 

381
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,580
mushroom farms even though they're nerf
now there's a there's a limit now only

382
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,590
now there's a there's a limit now only
 

383
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,580
now there's a there's a limit now only
five mushrooms can grow within a nine by

384
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:54,590
five mushrooms can grow within a nine by
 

385
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,900
five mushrooms can grow within a nine by
nine by three area I believe so these

386
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:58,910
nine by three area I believe so these
 

387
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,670
nine by three area I believe so these
are just going to be really small farms

388
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:00,680
are just going to be really small farms
 

389
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,540
are just going to be really small farms
I think the way I want to do it is I

390
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:04,550
I think the way I want to do it is I
 

391
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,950
I think the way I want to do it is I
want to have a pressure plate to harvest

392
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:07,960
want to have a pressure plate to harvest
 

393
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,730
want to have a pressure plate to harvest
stick it over here get started

394
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:15,740

 

395
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,670

that will stay in here and then let's go

396
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
that will stay in here and then let's go
 

397
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,860
that will stay in here and then let's go
in and it's going to hollow out an area

398
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:29,870
in and it's going to hollow out an area
 

399
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:41,010
in and it's going to hollow out an area
here for the mushrooms to grow let's see

400
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,020

 

401
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,810

how to do it I think I think I'll just

402
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:46,820
how to do it I think I think I'll just
 

403
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:55,110
how to do it I think I think I'll just
make a little tiny Oh shape thing so

404
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120

 

405
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,360

have we'll have the water here and it'll

406
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,370
have we'll have the water here and it'll
 

407
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,620
have we'll have the water here and it'll
go left and right around a block I'll

408
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:05,630
go left and right around a block I'll
 

409
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,769
go left and right around a block I'll
have more blocks here yeah so if we have

410
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:11,779
have more blocks here yeah so if we have
 

411
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,070
have more blocks here yeah so if we have
water here it'll flow around and stop

412
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,080
water here it'll flow around and stop
 

413
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,030
water here it'll flow around and stop
like that that's how I want to do it put

414
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
like that that's how I want to do it put
 

415
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,780
like that that's how I want to do it put
that there for now and so I'll put some

416
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,790
that there for now and so I'll put some
 

417
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:31,500
that there for now and so I'll put some
sticky pistons down here like so

418
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,510
sticky pistons down here like so
 

419
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,760
sticky pistons down here like so
block one over here

420
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:35,770
block one over here
 

421
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:44,530
block one over here
block okay and polish this up a little

422
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:44,540
block okay and polish this up a little
 

423
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,780
block okay and polish this up a little
bit and these will be special blocks I

424
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,790
bit and these will be special blocks I
 

425
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,949
bit and these will be special blocks I
got to start using different types of

426
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:53,959
got to start using different types of
 

427
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,800
got to start using different types of
blocks I think I'm getting too addicted

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:56,810
blocks I think I'm getting too addicted
 

429
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,269
blocks I think I'm getting too addicted
to these stone bricks but I'm not sure

430
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
to these stone bricks but I'm not sure
 

431
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,350
to these stone bricks but I'm not sure
what else to use people say sandstone

432
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
what else to use people say sandstone
 

433
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,290
what else to use people say sandstone
doesn't go with these very well and I

434
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,300
doesn't go with these very well and I
 

435
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,910
doesn't go with these very well and I
love sandstone I want to actually I

436
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:12,920
love sandstone I want to actually I
 

437
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,090
love sandstone I want to actually I
wanted to try those nether brick or the

438
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,100
wanted to try those nether brick or the
 

439
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,790
wanted to try those nether brick or the
nether brick out I like that I like the

440
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
nether brick out I like that I like the
 

441
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:27,260
nether brick out I like that I like the
look of those okay how do we do this now

442
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,270
look of those okay how do we do this now
 

443
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,900
look of those okay how do we do this now
so maybe underneath pressure plates

444
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:30,910
so maybe underneath pressure plates
 

445
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,600
so maybe underneath pressure plates
above there I'm going to switch this

446
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,610
above there I'm going to switch this
 

447
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,700
above there I'm going to switch this
with Kabul so I know it's where the wire

448
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:35,710
with Kabul so I know it's where the wire
 

449
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:46,200
with Kabul so I know it's where the wire
goes and it will go over through here we

450
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,210
goes and it will go over through here we
 

451
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,310
goes and it will go over through here we
should run into the Pistons I believe we

452
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
should run into the Pistons I believe we
 

453
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:58,500
should run into the Pistons I believe we
keep going hopefully maybe not out there

454
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,510
keep going hopefully maybe not out there
 

455
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:07,320
keep going hopefully maybe not out there
there okay how do we do this I think

456
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,330
there okay how do we do this I think
 

457
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,680
there okay how do we do this I think
I'll just come one block too low here

458
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,690
I'll just come one block too low here
 

459
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,670
I'll just come one block too low here
I'm going to put a redstone torch on

460
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
I'm going to put a redstone torch on
 

461
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,990
I'm going to put a redstone torch on
this block

462
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,000
this block
 

463
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,990
this block
ooh right over here for the pistons this

464
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
ooh right over here for the pistons this
 

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
ooh right over here for the pistons this
will be for wire let's see what do we do

466
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,010
will be for wire let's see what do we do
 

467
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,140
will be for wire let's see what do we do
here I'm going to put block here can you

468
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,150
here I'm going to put block here can you
 

469
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,560
here I'm going to put block here can you
guys see I hope you can see and I will

470
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,570
guys see I hope you can see and I will
 

471
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,550
guys see I hope you can see and I will
have a repeater which will send power to

472
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:47,560
have a repeater which will send power to
 

473
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,220
have a repeater which will send power to
the torch and then wire

474
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,230

 

475
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,440

yes very good

476
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,450
yes very good
 

477
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,940
yes very good
so now if I step on the pressure plate

478
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:01,950

 

479
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,990

flying anymore but now we need to do it
 

639
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,830
flying anymore but now we need to do it
for the bottom as well I guess the best

640
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
for the bottom as well I guess the best
 

641
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,860
for the bottom as well I guess the best
way of doing that will be to dig down

642
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:54,870
way of doing that will be to dig down
 

643
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,419
way of doing that will be to dig down
blocks all around in the ring oh and we

644
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:00,429
blocks all around in the ring oh and we
 

645
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:09,590
blocks all around in the ring oh and we
got stuff below I guess should be fine

646
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600

 

647
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,780

actually

648
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:11,790
actually
 

649
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,860
actually
over here I'm not going to put a piston

650
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:15,870
over here I'm not going to put a piston
 

651
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:23,040
over here I'm not going to put a piston
stupid that block I wonder what's down

652
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,050
stupid that block I wonder what's down
 

653
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,520
stupid that block I wonder what's down
there oh I think that's where I have my

654
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,530
there oh I think that's where I have my
 

655
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:33,450
there oh I think that's where I have my
pumped into actually Oh too far ok

656
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,460
pumped into actually Oh too far ok
 

657
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:43,670
pumped into actually Oh too far ok
Pistons all around

658
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:43,680

 

659
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,820

like that and then we'll have to put

660
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:49,830
like that and then we'll have to put
 

661
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:56,060
like that and then we'll have to put
wire beside it so like over here is a

662
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,070
wire beside it so like over here is a
 

663
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:04,610
wire beside it so like over here is a
good spot go around I'm going to replace

664
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:04,620
good spot go around I'm going to replace
 

665
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,560
good spot go around I'm going to replace
this with cobble this is something I do

666
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:06,570
this with cobble this is something I do
 

667
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,830
this with cobble this is something I do
so I know it's where the wire belongs if

668
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
so I know it's where the wire belongs if
 

669
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,570
so I know it's where the wire belongs if
water ever washes it away or something

670
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:11,580
water ever washes it away or something
 

671
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,080
water ever washes it away or something
or if I'm digging I don't I generally

672
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,090
or if I'm digging I don't I generally
 

673
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,520
or if I'm digging I don't I generally
won't dig through cobble unless I know

674
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,530
won't dig through cobble unless I know
 

675
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:31,540
won't dig through cobble unless I know
what's there okay I'll put our wire down

676
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:31,550
what's there okay I'll put our wire down
 

677
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:37,810
what's there okay I'll put our wire down
and this will all be hidden so it's fine

678
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:37,820

 

679
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:48,830

once you have your shelves there or it

680
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:48,840
once you have your shelves there or it
 

681
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,310
once you have your shelves there or it
should be and just put something in

682
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,320
should be and just put something in
 

683
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,270
should be and just put something in
front here I don't know it'll work

684
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,280
front here I don't know it'll work
 

685
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,260
front here I don't know it'll work
okay so I'll do it for the other side

686
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,270
okay so I'll do it for the other side
 

687
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,220
okay so I'll do it for the other side
now yeah and in the back we'll just have

688
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,230
now yeah and in the back we'll just have
 

689
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,020
now yeah and in the back we'll just have
two bookshelves that are always there

690
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,030
two bookshelves that are always there
 

691
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,850
two bookshelves that are always there
that don't move just because it

692
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:07,860
that don't move just because it
 

693
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,740
that don't move just because it
simplifies things a bit and it doesn't

694
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:09,750
simplifies things a bit and it doesn't
 

695
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,080
simplifies things a bit and it doesn't
really matter too much cuz it's still

696
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,090
really matter too much cuz it's still
 

697
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,290
really matter too much cuz it's still
fairly low level stuff oh well I just

698
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,300
fairly low level stuff oh well I just
 

699
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,120
fairly low level stuff oh well I just
doesn't have effect because it's they're

700
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,130
doesn't have effect because it's they're
 

701
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:28,190
doesn't have effect because it's they're
not bookshelves right and okay yeah I'm

702
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,200
not bookshelves right and okay yeah I'm
 

703
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,340
not bookshelves right and okay yeah I'm
liking this this should work out nice I

704
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,350
liking this this should work out nice I
 

705
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,140
liking this this should work out nice I
think what I want to do now is try get

706
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,150
think what I want to do now is try get
 

707
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,480
think what I want to do now is try get
that lever down to here so that wait can

708
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,490
that lever down to here so that wait can
 

709
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:47,540
that lever down to here so that wait can
I go there no maybe we'll try put it up

710
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:47,550
I go there no maybe we'll try put it up
 

711
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:54,450
I go there no maybe we'll try put it up
here somewhere then maybe here

712
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:54,460

 

713
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:04,210

that will be our targets okay so we can

714
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,220
that will be our targets okay so we can
 

715
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,620
that will be our targets okay so we can
do that pretty easily I think just go

716
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:07,630
do that pretty easily I think just go
 

717
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,730
do that pretty easily I think just go
let's get rid of this gravel it's that

718
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:09,740
let's get rid of this gravel it's that
 

719
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:21,910
let's get rid of this gravel it's that
way we want it all to be hidden if

720
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:21,920
way we want it all to be hidden if
 

721
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,470
way we want it all to be hidden if
possible although if this bookshelf

722
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
possible although if this bookshelf
 

723
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,050
possible although if this bookshelf
comes up you'll see the wire behind so

724
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,060
comes up you'll see the wire behind so
 

725
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,570
comes up you'll see the wire behind so
we should go in one more block because

726
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:31,580
we should go in one more block because
 

727
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,780
we should go in one more block because
this will go up and if I put a wire here

728
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:34,790
this will go up and if I put a wire here
 

729
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,000
this will go up and if I put a wire here
you'll see it so maybe I'll have to put

730
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,010
you'll see it so maybe I'll have to put
 

731
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,590
you'll see it so maybe I'll have to put
it here or down here let's put it down

732
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:44,600
it here or down here let's put it down
 

733
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,630
it here or down here let's put it down
here I'll probably switch this with

734
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:49,640
here I'll probably switch this with
 

735
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,190
here I'll probably switch this with
sandstone I'll have one there and other

736
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,200
sandstone I'll have one there and other
 

737
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,470
sandstone I'll have one there and other
one there that controls the bottom right

738
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,480
one there that controls the bottom right
 

739
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,370
one there that controls the bottom right
this will control the top right if we

740
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:03,380
this will control the top right if we
 

741
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:16,410
this will control the top right if we
can get it to go there um let's see I

742
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:16,420
can get it to go there um let's see I
 

743
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:26,530
can get it to go there um let's see I
shall do it off camera sorry about that

744
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:26,540
shall do it off camera sorry about that
 

745
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,110
shall do it off camera sorry about that
it's just so much easier to do stuff

746
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
it's just so much easier to do stuff
 

747
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,790
it's just so much easier to do stuff
when you don't have to worry about

748
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:30,800
when you don't have to worry about
 

749
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,470
when you don't have to worry about
timing and talking and all that stuff

750
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
timing and talking and all that stuff
 

751
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,670
timing and talking and all that stuff
okay so what I'm actually gonna do is

752
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:36,680
okay so what I'm actually gonna do is
 

753
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,530
okay so what I'm actually gonna do is
the switches with sandstone now because

754
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:38,540
the switches with sandstone now because
 

755
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,720
the switches with sandstone now because
I know I want it I need it relievers

756
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:43,730
I know I want it I need it relievers
 

757
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,640
I know I want it I need it relievers
there I'm going to use some redstone

758
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,650
there I'm going to use some redstone
 

759
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:51,760
there I'm going to use some redstone
torches at indicator lights so we have

760
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:51,770
torches at indicator lights so we have
 

761
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,520
torches at indicator lights so we have
some kind of visual indication if it's

762
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,530
some kind of visual indication if it's
 

763
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,200
some kind of visual indication if it's
on or off

764
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,210
on or off
 

765
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,919
on or off
then I have the wire ready to go here

766
00:27:59,919 --> 00:27:59,929
then I have the wire ready to go here
 

767
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:04,640
then I have the wire ready to go here
goes up like that and it is long on

768
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:04,650
goes up like that and it is long on
 

769
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,100
goes up like that and it is long on
Earth's short enough to so one two three

770
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,110
Earth's short enough to so one two three
 

771
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,870
Earth's short enough to so one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten

772
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:11,880
four five six seven eight nine ten
 

773
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,080
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve

774
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,090
eleven twelve
 

775
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,000
eleven twelve
redstone power to travel fifteen blocks

776
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,010
redstone power to travel fifteen blocks
 

777
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:23,600
redstone power to travel fifteen blocks
so it's within range they all go down

778
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:23,610
so it's within range they all go down
 

779
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,400
so it's within range they all go down
it's very nice

780
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,410
it's very nice
 

781
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,360
it's very nice
so now copy that on the other side I'll

782
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,370
so now copy that on the other side I'll
 

783
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,799
so now copy that on the other side I'll
probably have this built up it'd all be

784
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:33,809
probably have this built up it'd all be
 

785
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:42,169
probably have this built up it'd all be
hidden there will be something behind

786
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:42,179
hidden there will be something behind
 

787
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,100
hidden there will be something behind
here to and behind I'll replace all this

788
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,110
here to and behind I'll replace all this
 

789
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,930
here to and behind I'll replace all this
stone with something to probably

790
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:47,940
stone with something to probably
 

791
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,230
stone with something to probably
sandstone I don't know just to give it a

792
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,240
sandstone I don't know just to give it a
 

793
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,760
sandstone I don't know just to give it a
clean look we'll try hide all the

794
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:52,770
clean look we'll try hide all the
 

795
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,169
clean look we'll try hide all the
pistons and I may lower the ground to

796
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:57,179
