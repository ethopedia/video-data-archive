00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,270
welcome back to another episode of our
let's play series

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
let's play series
 

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,270
let's play series
to begin with today guys we're going to

10
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
to begin with today guys we're going to
 

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,029
to begin with today guys we're going to
be doing something weird

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
be doing something weird
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,510
be doing something weird
something very strange we're going to be

14
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
something very strange we're going to be
 

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,710
something very strange we're going to be
exploiting a bug in the game

16
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
exploiting a bug in the game
 

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,790
exploiting a bug in the game
this is actually been in the game for

18
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
this is actually been in the game for
 

19
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,950
this is actually been in the game for
quite a while now

20
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
quite a while now
 

21
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,589
quite a while now
and i've always wanted to do like

22
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
and i've always wanted to do like
 

23
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:29,990
and i've always wanted to do like
something

24
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
something
 

25
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,470
something
with it but i'm worried if i do a big

26
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
with it but i'm worried if i do a big
 

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,990
with it but i'm worried if i do a big
elaborate build

28
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
elaborate build
 

29
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,510
elaborate build
revolving around it it's going to get

30
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
revolving around it it's going to get
 

31
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,549
revolving around it it's going to get
patched and then i'm going to have a

32
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
patched and then i'm going to have a
 

33
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,790
patched and then i'm going to have a
broken thing in my world

34
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
broken thing in my world
 

35
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,389
broken thing in my world
but also i didn't really understand it

36
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
but also i didn't really understand it
 

37
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,990
but also i didn't really understand it
too well today i got a better idea of

38
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
too well today i got a better idea of
 

39
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,670
too well today i got a better idea of
how it works

40
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
how it works
 

41
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,029
how it works
because sometimes it would work for me

42
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
because sometimes it would work for me
 

43
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,869
because sometimes it would work for me
and sometimes i it wouldn't and i didn't

44
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
and sometimes i it wouldn't and i didn't
 

45
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,630
and sometimes i it wouldn't and i didn't
understand why

46
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
understand why
 

47
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,229
understand why
but effectively it allows you to

48
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
but effectively it allows you to
 

49
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,150
but effectively it allows you to
teleport anywhere in your world

50
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
teleport anywhere in your world
 

51
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,750
teleport anywhere in your world
very quickly which is very cool

52
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
very quickly which is very cool
 

53
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,350
very quickly which is very cool
well not anywhere in your world but if

54
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
well not anywhere in your world but if
 

55
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,510
well not anywhere in your world but if
you set up the portals properly

56
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
you set up the portals properly
 

57
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,869
you set up the portals properly
basically anywhere you want um so it's a

58
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
basically anywhere you want um so it's a
 

59
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,070
basically anywhere you want um so it's a
portal glitch

60
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
portal glitch
 

61
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,750
portal glitch
let's let's demonstrate first look at

62
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
let's let's demonstrate first look at
 

63
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,550
let's let's demonstrate first look at
our coordinates xyz we're at minus 62

64
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
our coordinates xyz we're at minus 62
 

65
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,750
our coordinates xyz we're at minus 62
and 524 it uh approximately divides by

66
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
and 524 it uh approximately divides by
 

67
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,030
and 524 it uh approximately divides by
eights

68
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
eights
 

69
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,870
eights
i'm still not quite sure about that

70
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
i'm still not quite sure about that
 

71
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,190
i'm still not quite sure about that
though but if i throw an ender pearl

72
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
though but if i throw an ender pearl
 

73
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,670
though but if i throw an ender pearl
through here

74
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
through here
 

75
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,310
through here
we go to minus 29 and 89 so it's not

76
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
we go to minus 29 and 89 so it's not
 

77
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,710
we go to minus 29 and 89 so it's not
always dividing by eight

78
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
always dividing by eight
 

79
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,550
always dividing by eight
which is a little weird you tell you can

80
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
which is a little weird you tell you can
 

81
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,910
which is a little weird you tell you can
tell i've done this before

82
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
tell i've done this before
 

83
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,109
tell i've done this before
got a ladder to escape so what it's

84
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
got a ladder to escape so what it's
 

85
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,230
got a ladder to escape so what it's
doing

86
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
doing
 

87
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,590
doing
you throw the ender pearl through the

88
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
you throw the ender pearl through the
 

89
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,429
you throw the ender pearl through the
portal and

90
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
portal and
 

91
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,069
portal and
it it divides the coordinates of the

92
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
it it divides the coordinates of the
 

93
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,590
it it divides the coordinates of the
ender pearl by eight

94
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
ender pearl by eight
 

95
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,510
ender pearl by eight
like it would when it goes to the nether

96
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
like it would when it goes to the nether
 

97
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,030
like it would when it goes to the nether
except it doesn't actually go to the

98
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
except it doesn't actually go to the
 

99
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,590
except it doesn't actually go to the
nether

100
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
nether
 

101
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,030
nether
teleports in the overworld and then if

102
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
teleports in the overworld and then if
 

103
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,630
teleports in the overworld and then if
that chunk is loaded

104
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
that chunk is loaded
 

105
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,550
that chunk is loaded
or if the ender pearl stays loaded long

106
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
or if the ender pearl stays loaded long
 

107
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,469
or if the ender pearl stays loaded long
enough then it will

108
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
enough then it will
 

109
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,670
enough then it will
collide with something and you'll

110
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
collide with something and you'll
 

111
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,950
collide with something and you'll
teleport and the flip side to this guys

112
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
teleport and the flip side to this guys
 

113
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,469
teleport and the flip side to this guys
if we're in the nether here instead of

114
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
if we're in the nether here instead of
 

115
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,910
if we're in the nether here instead of
dividing by eights

116
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
dividing by eights
 

117
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,350
dividing by eights
or eight-ish it multiplies by eight-ish

118
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
or eight-ish it multiplies by eight-ish
 

119
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,070
or eight-ish it multiplies by eight-ish
so if we're at 90 minus 90 and minus 374

120
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
so if we're at 90 minus 90 and minus 374
 

121
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,830
so if we're at 90 minus 90 and minus 374
we should go to roughly eight times that

122
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840

 

123
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,910

oh again you got to kind of get the

124
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
oh again you got to kind of get the
 

125
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,229
oh again you got to kind of get the
ender pearl throw just right too though

126
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
ender pearl throw just right too though
 

127
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,350
ender pearl throw just right too though
otherwise you'll hit though oh

128
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
otherwise you'll hit though oh
 

129
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,150
otherwise you'll hit though oh
oh he went through um

130
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
oh he went through um
 

131
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,030
oh he went through um
there we go that works

132
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040

 

133
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,830

and you can tell i've done that before

134
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
and you can tell i've done that before
 

135
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,550
and you can tell i've done that before
too

136
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
too
 

137
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,990
too
whoa whoa

138
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
whoa whoa
 

139
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,110
whoa whoa
nelly i just fell to my death

140
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
nelly i just fell to my death
 

141
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,630
nelly i just fell to my death
yeah be careful about digging straight

142
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
yeah be careful about digging straight
 

143
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,350
yeah be careful about digging straight
down after you do that apparently

144
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360

 

145
00:02:49,360 --> 00:03:00,470

fortress big fortress

146
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480

 

147
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,550

all right guys so we are over at the

148
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
all right guys so we are over at the
 

149
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,550
all right guys so we are over at the
amplified base now we're gonna see if we

150
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
amplified base now we're gonna see if we
 

151
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,630
amplified base now we're gonna see if we
can use this portal trick

152
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
can use this portal trick
 

153
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,390
can use this portal trick
creeper blast to our advantage

154
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
creeper blast to our advantage
 

155
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,149
creeper blast to our advantage
uh we're gonna see if we can get a quick

156
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
uh we're gonna see if we can get a quick
 

157
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,670
uh we're gonna see if we can get a quick
way back home

158
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
way back home
 

159
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,309
way back home
using it how hard is it to actually link

160
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
using it how hard is it to actually link
 

161
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,309
using it how hard is it to actually link
up the coordinates and stuff that's what

162
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
up the coordinates and stuff that's what
 

163
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,509
up the coordinates and stuff that's what
we're trying to figure out so we're

164
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
we're trying to figure out so we're
 

165
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,309
we're trying to figure out so we're
gonna set up a brand new portal here

166
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
gonna set up a brand new portal here
 

167
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,390
gonna set up a brand new portal here
uh we're gonna throw it into the left

168
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
uh we're gonna throw it into the left
 

169
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,350
uh we're gonna throw it into the left
block every time let's plan for that

170
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
block every time let's plan for that
 

171
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,350
block every time let's plan for that
let's see if we can get it to take us

172
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
let's see if we can get it to take us
 

173
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,550
let's see if we can get it to take us
somewhere yeah we went somewhere

174
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
somewhere yeah we went somewhere
 

175
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,830
somewhere yeah we went somewhere
underground that's good kind of

176
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
underground that's good kind of
 

177
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,030
underground that's good kind of
so we're minus nine and

178
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
so we're minus nine and
 

179
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,350
so we're minus nine and
minus six thirty six okay sounds like i

180
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
minus six thirty six okay sounds like i
 

181
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,470
minus six thirty six okay sounds like i
heard a pig

182
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
heard a pig
 

183
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,390
heard a pig
so we're not all the way back home what

184
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
so we're not all the way back home what
 

185
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,149
so we're not all the way back home what
we would do now is set up another

186
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
we would do now is set up another
 

187
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,550
we would do now is set up another
portal and that'll take us pretty much

188
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
portal and that'll take us pretty much
 

189
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,750
portal and that'll take us pretty much
the rest of the way

190
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
the rest of the way
 

191
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,110
the rest of the way
back to zero zero okay

192
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
back to zero zero okay
 

193
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,350
back to zero zero okay
all right let's see if this is broken

194
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
all right let's see if this is broken
 

195
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,910
all right let's see if this is broken
there might be some repercussions to

196
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
there might be some repercussions to
 

197
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,750
there might be some repercussions to
doing this guys don't do it in your

198
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
doing this guys don't do it in your
 

199
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,030
doing this guys don't do it in your
world

200
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
world
 

201
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,229
world
bugs can actually be bad sometimes

202
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
bugs can actually be bad sometimes
 

203
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,830
bugs can actually be bad sometimes
yeah that's weird

204
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840

 

205
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,429

that is really weird um

206
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
that is really weird um
 

207
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,629
that is really weird um
i don't think this was here before

208
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
i don't think this was here before
 

209
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,629
i don't think this was here before
i'm just saying some some odd things

210
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
i'm just saying some some odd things
 

211
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,189
i'm just saying some some odd things
have happened

212
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
have happened
 

213
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,590
have happened
okay that might be why my gold firm had

214
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
okay that might be why my gold firm had
 

215
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,030
okay that might be why my gold firm had
so much portal trouble too

216
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
so much portal trouble too
 

217
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,189
so much portal trouble too
because i've done this a long time ago

218
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
because i've done this a long time ago
 

219
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,110
because i've done this a long time ago
maybe i broke the portals

220
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120

 

221
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,110

i don't know and if we

222
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
i don't know and if we
 

223
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
i don't know and if we
actually i think we gotta fly it don't

224
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
actually i think we gotta fly it don't
 

225
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,950
actually i think we gotta fly it don't
we

226
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
we
 

227
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,629
we
let's see if we fly this way am i gonna

228
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
let's see if we fly this way am i gonna
 

229
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,790
let's see if we fly this way am i gonna
teleport eventually

230
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
teleport eventually
 

231
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,310
teleport eventually
is that what that's what happened last

232
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
is that what that's what happened last
 

233
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,310
is that what that's what happened last
time

234
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
time
 

235
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,469
time
let's see if it happens this time

236
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479

 

237
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,110

yep oh man that's that's weird

238
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
yep oh man that's that's weird
 

239
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,430
yep oh man that's that's weird
that is some weird stuff happening so i

240
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
that is some weird stuff happening so i
 

241
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,710
that is some weird stuff happening so i
think some of the ender pearls actually

242
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
think some of the ender pearls actually
 

243
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,469
think some of the ender pearls actually
went through this portal

244
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
went through this portal
 

245
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,150
went through this portal
and then when the chunk loaded again it

246
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
and then when the chunk loaded again it
 

247
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,909
and then when the chunk loaded again it
teleported me there

248
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919

 

249
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,990

and now if we go through again

250
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
and now if we go through again
 

251
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,189
and now if we go through again
let's look at our coordinates this time

252
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
let's look at our coordinates this time
 

253
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,310
let's look at our coordinates this time
so we're at minus 45

254
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
so we're at minus 45
 

255
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,590
so we're at minus 45
minus 5085.

256
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
minus 5085.
 

257
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,950
minus 5085.
there we go i wonder if it duplicates

258
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
there we go i wonder if it duplicates
 

259
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,110
there we go i wonder if it duplicates
the ender pearls

260
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
the ender pearls
 

261
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,710
the ender pearls
kind of wondering if that's what's

262
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
kind of wondering if that's what's
 

263
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,110
kind of wondering if that's what's
happening now

264
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
happening now
 

265
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,150
happening now
okay do it again

266
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
okay do it again
 

267
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,430
okay do it again
come on

268
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440

 

269
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,189

i can't figure out the distance though

270
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
i can't figure out the distance though
 

271
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,070
i can't figure out the distance though
there we go perfect okay so that takes

272
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
there we go perfect okay so that takes
 

273
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,590
there we go perfect okay so that takes
us to here minus 45 and -107

274
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
us to here minus 45 and -107
 

275
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,870
us to here minus 45 and -107
we're pretty much oh i think i can take

276
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
we're pretty much oh i think i can take
 

277
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,270
we're pretty much oh i think i can take
off from the water

278
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
off from the water
 

279
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,390
off from the water
ah it's too much too much work uh that

280
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
ah it's too much too much work uh that
 

281
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,469
ah it's too much too much work uh that
takes us pretty much home now

282
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
takes us pretty much home now
 

283
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,670
takes us pretty much home now
we are right over here

284
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
we are right over here
 

285
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,710
we are right over here
so that's pretty cool

286
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720

 

287
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,790

oh yeah i found this guy by the way

288
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
oh yeah i found this guy by the way
 

289
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,029
oh yeah i found this guy by the way
remember how we lost the creeper

290
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
remember how we lost the creeper
 

291
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,950
remember how we lost the creeper
he somehow made his way over to this

292
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
he somehow made his way over to this
 

293
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,309
he somehow made his way over to this
boat

294
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
boat
 

295
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,270
boat
and uh he's fine he's all good let's try

296
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
and uh he's fine he's all good let's try
 

297
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,430
and uh he's fine he's all good let's try
out the portal once more here

298
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
out the portal once more here
 

299
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,909
out the portal once more here
and see if it's still glitched out if it

300
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
and see if it's still glitched out if it
 

301
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,830
and see if it's still glitched out if it
is i'm gonna try reload my game and see

302
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
is i'm gonna try reload my game and see
 

303
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,870
is i'm gonna try reload my game and see
if that fixes it

304
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880

 

305
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,629

still glitched out yep still glitched

306
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
still glitched out yep still glitched
 

307
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,629
still glitched out yep still glitched
out

308
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
out
 

309
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,670
out
okay so the world has been reloaded the

310
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
okay so the world has been reloaded the
 

311
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,230
okay so the world has been reloaded the
game has been reloaded

312
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
game has been reloaded
 

313
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,270
game has been reloaded
let's see if it's still messed up

314
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
let's see if it's still messed up
 

315
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,350
let's see if it's still messed up
i'm really hoping it's not it's not

316
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
i'm really hoping it's not it's not
 

317
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,629
i'm really hoping it's not it's not
oh so it was saving it a memory

318
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
oh so it was saving it a memory
 

319
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,430
oh so it was saving it a memory
somewhere

320
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
somewhere
 

321
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,950
somewhere
but it didn't actually have a permanent

322
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
but it didn't actually have a permanent
 

323
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,350
but it didn't actually have a permanent
effect on my world that's good

324
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
effect on my world that's good
 

325
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,309
effect on my world that's good
that is very good but anyways i'm gonna

326
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
that is very good but anyways i'm gonna
 

327
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,670
that is very good but anyways i'm gonna
play around with that a little bit more

328
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
play around with that a little bit more
 

329
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,189
play around with that a little bit more
probably and hopefully

330
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
probably and hopefully
 

331
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,350
probably and hopefully
figure out some of the finer details to

332
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
figure out some of the finer details to
 

333
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,350
figure out some of the finer details to
it the thing i learned about it today

334
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
it the thing i learned about it today
 

335
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,230
it the thing i learned about it today
though

336
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
though
 

337
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,830
though
sometimes when you throw the ender pearl

338
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
sometimes when you throw the ender pearl
 

339
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,350
sometimes when you throw the ender pearl
through the portal

340
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
through the portal
 

341
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,749
through the portal
it doesn't actually teleport you and

342
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
it doesn't actually teleport you and
 

343
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,629
it doesn't actually teleport you and
that happens

344
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
that happens
 

345
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,749
that happens
i'm pretty sure because when the ender

346
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
i'm pretty sure because when the ender
 

347
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,710
i'm pretty sure because when the ender
pro goes through

348
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
pro goes through
 

349
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,749
pro goes through
it loads the chunk but only for a short

350
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
it loads the chunk but only for a short
 

351
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,270
it loads the chunk but only for a short
amount of time so if it's like in an

352
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
amount of time so if it's like in an
 

353
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,550
amount of time so if it's like in an
open air

354
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
open air
 

355
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,790
open air
area and the ender pearl has to fly

356
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
area and the ender pearl has to fly
 

357
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,309
area and the ender pearl has to fly
several seconds for that

358
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
several seconds for that
 

359
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,390
several seconds for that
to hit something it's going to unload

360
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
to hit something it's going to unload
 

361
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,309
to hit something it's going to unload
the chunk before that happens

362
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
the chunk before that happens
 

363
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,309
the chunk before that happens
so you need to put the portals in like

364
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
so you need to put the portals in like
 

365
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,510
so you need to put the portals in like
an area with a lot of blocks around

366
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
an area with a lot of blocks around
 

367
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,390
an area with a lot of blocks around
i'm guessing is what i understand now

368
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
i'm guessing is what i understand now
 

369
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,350
i'm guessing is what i understand now
anyways

370
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
anyways
 

371
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,950
anyways
our goal for today guys we're trying to

372
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
our goal for today guys we're trying to
 

373
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,790
our goal for today guys we're trying to
build a super smell tree we looked into

374
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
build a super smell tree we looked into
 

375
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,390
build a super smell tree we looked into
this last time

376
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
this last time
 

377
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,350
this last time
and it's actually a pretty complicated

378
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
and it's actually a pretty complicated
 

379
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,870
and it's actually a pretty complicated
thing to do here

380
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
thing to do here
 

381
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,990
thing to do here
so if we if we put the items in

382
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
so if we if we put the items in
 

383
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,589
so if we if we put the items in
the chest the hopper minecart pulls them

384
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
the chest the hopper minecart pulls them
 

385
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,029
the chest the hopper minecart pulls them
out super fast

386
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
out super fast
 

387
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,950
out super fast
but then the problem comes up is how do

388
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
but then the problem comes up is how do
 

389
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,790
but then the problem comes up is how do
we distribute

390
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
we distribute
 

391
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,749
we distribute
the items from the that hopper mine cart

392
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
the items from the that hopper mine cart
 

393
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,309
the items from the that hopper mine cart
here

394
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
here
 

395
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,909
here
because if we put them into a normal

396
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
because if we put them into a normal
 

397
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,510
because if we put them into a normal
hopper it's slow

398
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
hopper it's slow
 

399
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,749
hopper it's slow
uh if we put like eight hopper minecarts

400
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
uh if we put like eight hopper minecarts
 

401
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,589
uh if we put like eight hopper minecarts
underneath this chest

402
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
underneath this chest
 

403
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,350
underneath this chest
how do you separate the hopper minecarts

404
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
how do you separate the hopper minecarts
 

405
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,629
how do you separate the hopper minecarts
then cause they're all together you know

406
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
then cause they're all together you know
 

407
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,430
then cause they're all together you know
and how do you do

408
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
and how do you do
 

409
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,150
and how do you do
how do you separate them quickly you

410
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
how do you separate them quickly you
 

411
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,469
how do you separate them quickly you
can't really

412
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
can't really
 

413
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,550
can't really
the other problem is hopper mine carts

414
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
the other problem is hopper mine carts
 

415
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,909
the other problem is hopper mine carts
are kind of broken

416
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
are kind of broken
 

417
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,350
are kind of broken
in my opinion they can't

418
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
in my opinion they can't
 

419
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,749
in my opinion they can't
so here's here's some bad game design or

420
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
so here's here's some bad game design or
 

421
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,070
so here's here's some bad game design or
it's a bug or something

422
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
it's a bug or something
 

423
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,869
it's a bug or something
like regular hoppers can pull items out

424
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
like regular hoppers can pull items out
 

425
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,990
like regular hoppers can pull items out
of a chest and they can

426
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
of a chest and they can
 

427
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,390
of a chest and they can
put items into a chest they have a pull

428
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
put items into a chest they have a pull
 

429
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,110
put items into a chest they have a pull
and

430
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
and
 

431
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,949
and
push or pull and puts mechanic to them

432
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
push or pull and puts mechanic to them
 

433
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,949
push or pull and puts mechanic to them
hopper minecarts can only pull items

434
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
hopper minecarts can only pull items
 

435
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,709
hopper minecarts can only pull items
they can't put anything

436
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
they can't put anything
 

437
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,829
they can't put anything
into the chest the only reason why this

438
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
into the chest the only reason why this
 

439
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,149
into the chest the only reason why this
hopper

440
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
hopper
 

441
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,829
hopper
got items is because it pulled it out of

442
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
got items is because it pulled it out of
 

443
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,190
got items is because it pulled it out of
the hopper mine cart

444

the hopper mine cart
 

445
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,110
the hopper mine cart
if we didn't have hoppers you could not

446
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
if we didn't have hoppers you could not
 

447
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,590
if we didn't have hoppers you could not
unload hopper mine carts

448
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
unload hopper mine carts
 

449
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,670
unload hopper mine carts
all right guys so let's get started on

450
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
all right guys so let's get started on
 

451
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,829
all right guys so let's get started on
our super smelter here i've decided to

452
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
our super smelter here i've decided to
 

453
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,990
our super smelter here i've decided to
put it across from the nexus we're going

454
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
put it across from the nexus we're going
 

455
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,470
put it across from the nexus we're going
to

456
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
to
 

457
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,269
to
line it up in the middle here and the

458
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
line it up in the middle here and the
 

459
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,269
line it up in the middle here and the
first thing we got to do is dig a hole

460
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
first thing we got to do is dig a hole
 

461
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,030
first thing we got to do is dig a hole
let's dig a hole uh most of the smeltery

462
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
let's dig a hole uh most of the smeltery
 

463
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,790
let's dig a hole uh most of the smeltery
stuff is going to be underground

464
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800

 

465
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,670

i figure we'll need to go down eight

466
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
i figure we'll need to go down eight
 

467
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,630
i figure we'll need to go down eight
blocks

468
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
blocks
 

469
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,670
blocks
and oh there's redstone there oh i think

470
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
and oh there's redstone there oh i think
 

471
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,310
and oh there's redstone there oh i think
that was from the end reporter

472
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
that was from the end reporter
 

473
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,670
that was from the end reporter
yes yes it was

474
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
yes yes it was
 

475
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,110
yes yes it was
that's fine yes

476
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
that's fine yes
 

477
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,910
that's fine yes
how far down are we one two three four

478
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
how far down are we one two three four
 

479
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,470
how far down are we one two three four
five

480
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
five
 

481
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,389
five
six oh we're actually pretty close here

482
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
six oh we're actually pretty close here
 

483
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,670
six oh we're actually pretty close here
maybe we'll shave off a little bit more

484
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680

 

485
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,949

all right it's very good we got

486
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
all right it's very good we got
 

487
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,790
all right it's very good we got
ourselves a hold that here

488
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
ourselves a hold that here
 

489
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,030
ourselves a hold that here
now i'm going to put down a layer of

490
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
now i'm going to put down a layer of
 

491
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,550
now i'm going to put down a layer of
wooden planks

492
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
wooden planks
 

493
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,230
wooden planks
i'm trying something different here

494
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
i'm trying something different here
 

495
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,310
i'm trying something different here
usually when i do redstone

496
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
usually when i do redstone
 

497
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,430
usually when i do redstone
i dig out the bare minimum and then keep

498
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
i dig out the bare minimum and then keep
 

499
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,509
i dig out the bare minimum and then keep
expanding as i need more space this way

500
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
expanding as i need more space this way
 

501
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,430
expanding as i need more space this way
we're gonna have lots plenty of space

502
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
we're gonna have lots plenty of space
 

503
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,870
we're gonna have lots plenty of space
we'll be able to look around and

504
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
we'll be able to look around and
 

505
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,870
we'll be able to look around and
walk around our redstone build as we

506
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
walk around our redstone build as we
 

507
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,389
walk around our redstone build as we
build it

508
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
build it
 

509
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,630
build it
and it'll look nicer more pleasant

510
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
and it'll look nicer more pleasant
 

511
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,190
and it'll look nicer more pleasant
because we have a beautiful wood floor

512
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
because we have a beautiful wood floor
 

513
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,670
because we have a beautiful wood floor
aha i'm learning guys i'm learning how

514
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
aha i'm learning guys i'm learning how
 

515
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,310
aha i'm learning guys i'm learning how
to play this game

516
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
to play this game
 

517
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,710
to play this game
and there we go guys cool so let's see

518
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
and there we go guys cool so let's see
 

519
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,870
and there we go guys cool so let's see
if we can design this together

520
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
if we can design this together
 

521
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,870
if we can design this together
i have a rough idea of what i'm doing

522
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
i have a rough idea of what i'm doing
 

523
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,790
i have a rough idea of what i'm doing
but i haven't worked out all the details

524
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
but i haven't worked out all the details
 

525
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,389
but i haven't worked out all the details
to this build yet so that's

526
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
to this build yet so that's
 

527
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,670
to this build yet so that's
that's the fun part but uh basically on

528
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
that's the fun part but uh basically on
 

529
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,430
that's the fun part but uh basically on
the ground here

530
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
the ground here
 

531
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,069
the ground here
i want a rail line to pick up items out

532
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
i want a rail line to pick up items out
 

533
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,910
i want a rail line to pick up items out
of the furnaces so they'll be

534
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
of the furnaces so they'll be
 

535
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,389
of the furnaces so they'll be
hopper mine carts at this level there'll

536
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
hopper mine carts at this level there'll
 

537
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,829
hopper mine carts at this level there'll
be

538
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
be
 

539
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,350
be
furnaces at this level and to put the

540
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
furnaces at this level and to put the
 

541
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,030
furnaces at this level and to put the
items into the furnace we'll have a

542
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
items into the furnace we'll have a
 

543
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,590
items into the furnace we'll have a
hopper

544
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
hopper
 

545
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,630
hopper
here um we got to figure out the heights

546
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
here um we got to figure out the heights
 

547
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,590
here um we got to figure out the heights
to all these things

548
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
to all these things
 

549
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,030
to all these things
because this we're building this in

550
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
because this we're building this in
 

551
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,590
because this we're building this in
reverse which makes it complicated

552
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
reverse which makes it complicated
 

553
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,350
reverse which makes it complicated
and then there'll be another hopper mine

554
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
and then there'll be another hopper mine
 

555
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,389
and then there'll be another hopper mine
cart running over top of that

556
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
cart running over top of that
 

557
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,310
cart running over top of that
all right so then we'll fill it at this

558
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
all right so then we'll fill it at this
 

559
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,150
all right so then we'll fill it at this
level

560
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
level
 

561
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,790
level
yeah okay so i marked out our center

562
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
yeah okay so i marked out our center
 

563
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,590
yeah okay so i marked out our center
here

564
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
here
 

565
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,670
here
and we're going to try to build this

566
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
and we're going to try to build this
 

567
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,949
and we're going to try to build this
together

568
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
together
 

569
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,430
together
in case you guys want to copy it i want

570
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
in case you guys want to copy it i want
 

571
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,590
in case you guys want to copy it i want
you to see how i do it

572
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
you to see how i do it
 

573
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,430
you to see how i do it
if you don't know as a youtuber it's

574
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
if you don't know as a youtuber it's
 

575
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,910
if you don't know as a youtuber it's
very difficult to build in minecraft

576
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
very difficult to build in minecraft
 

577
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,910
very difficult to build in minecraft
while talking the only way i can do it

578
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
while talking the only way i can do it
 

579
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,030
while talking the only way i can do it
personally

580
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
personally
 

581
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,670
personally
is if i create like a rough outline in

582
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
is if i create like a rough outline in
 

583
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,310
is if i create like a rough outline in
memory

584
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
memory
 

585
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,509
memory
in my memory my brain instead of using

586
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
in my memory my brain instead of using
 

587
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,710
in my memory my brain instead of using
short-term memory

588
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
short-term memory
 

589
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,670
short-term memory
for what i want to say it's a

590
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
for what i want to say it's a
 

591
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,230
for what i want to say it's a
complicated process guys

592
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
complicated process guys
 

593
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,910
complicated process guys
so i've i got a rough idea of what i

594
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
so i've i got a rough idea of what i
 

595
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,190
so i've i got a rough idea of what i
want to build here and a rough idea of

596
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
want to build here and a rough idea of
 

597
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,350
want to build here and a rough idea of
what i want to say basically

598
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
what i want to say basically
 

599
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,150
what i want to say basically
uh so what we're trying to do is build a

600
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
uh so what we're trying to do is build a
 

601
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,470
uh so what we're trying to do is build a
super fast furnace array here

602
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
super fast furnace array here
 

603
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,990
super fast furnace array here
and i've decided we're going to split 64

604
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
and i've decided we're going to split 64
 

605
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,670
and i've decided we're going to split 64
furnaces into eight groups so there's

606
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
furnaces into eight groups so there's
 

607
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,310
furnaces into eight groups so there's
gonna be eight groups of eight furnaces

608
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
gonna be eight groups of eight furnaces
 

609
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,990
gonna be eight groups of eight furnaces
each of the groups will have one hopper

610
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
each of the groups will have one hopper
 

611
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
each of the groups will have one hopper
mine carts for

612
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
mine carts for
 

613
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,470
mine carts for
delivering the items into the furnace

614
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
delivering the items into the furnace
 

615
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,829
delivering the items into the furnace
one hopper minecart for

616
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
one hopper minecart for
 

617
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,910
one hopper minecart for
filling it with fuel and another hopper

618
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
filling it with fuel and another hopper
 

619
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,670
filling it with fuel and another hopper
minecart for

620
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
minecart for
 

621
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,350
minecart for
picking up items so three total

622
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
picking up items so three total
 

623
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,670
picking up items so three total
for a grand total of twenty four three

624
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
for a grand total of twenty four three
 

625
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,110
for a grand total of twenty four three
times eight

626
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
times eight
 

627
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,949
times eight
twenty four it's a lot of hopper mine

628
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
twenty four it's a lot of hopper mine
 

629
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,389
twenty four it's a lot of hopper mine
carts

630
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
carts
 

631
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,230
carts
i didn't realize realize that until just

632
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
i didn't realize realize that until just
 

633
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,509
i didn't realize realize that until just
now

634
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
now
 

635
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,269
now
uh but there'll be a track running up

636
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
uh but there'll be a track running up
 

637
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,190
uh but there'll be a track running up
across here

638
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
across here
 

639
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,750
across here
with one hopper mine carts there'll be

640
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
with one hopper mine carts there'll be
 

641
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,550
with one hopper mine carts there'll be
another track

642
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
another track
 

643
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,389
another track
running across here with another one and

644
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
running across here with another one and
 

645
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,629
running across here with another one and
the key here to making this super fast

646
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
the key here to making this super fast
 

647
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,069
the key here to making this super fast
guys is we're going to be using

648
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
guys is we're going to be using
 

649
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,949
guys is we're going to be using
a splitter in the middle here um this is

650
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
a splitter in the middle here um this is
 

651
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,269
a splitter in the middle here um this is
a

652
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
a
 

653
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,829
a
technical thing i've never built before

654
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
technical thing i've never built before
 

655
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,550
technical thing i've never built before
but if you need

656
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
but if you need
 

657
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,190
but if you need
super fast piping this might be

658
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
super fast piping this might be
 

659
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,670
super fast piping this might be
something you want to use

660
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
something you want to use
 

661
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,629
something you want to use
let's see oh i might have got the

662
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
let's see oh i might have got the
 

663
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,670
let's see oh i might have got the
positions wrong here

664
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
positions wrong here
 

665
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,910
positions wrong here
let's see how would this work we would

666
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
let's see how would this work we would
 

667
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,870
let's see how would this work we would
want to come out

668
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
want to come out
 

669
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,230
want to come out
two blocks on this side probably

670
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
two blocks on this side probably
 

671
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,949
two blocks on this side probably
it's like we have an odd odd center odd

672
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
it's like we have an odd odd center odd
 

673
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,150
it's like we have an odd odd center odd
number center but

674
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
number center but
 

675
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,870
number center but
it's actually an even build so it's

676
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
it's actually an even build so it's
 

677
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,949
it's actually an even build so it's
gonna be a bit confusing

678
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
gonna be a bit confusing
 

679
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,030
gonna be a bit confusing
um i think

680
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040

 

681
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,470

i think there's gonna be some blocks

682
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
i think there's gonna be some blocks
 

683
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,949
i think there's gonna be some blocks
down here the track's actually going to

684
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
down here the track's actually going to
 

685
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,310
down here the track's actually going to
go all the way up to here you need a

686
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
go all the way up to here you need a
 

687
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,990
go all the way up to here you need a
block next to the track

688
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
block next to the track
 

689
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,430
block next to the track
so that when it gets powered it'll

690
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
so that when it gets powered it'll
 

691
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,590
so that when it gets powered it'll
actually make the minecart move

692
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
actually make the minecart move
 

693
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,629
actually make the minecart move
all right and the other key to this is

694
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
all right and the other key to this is
 

695
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,670
all right and the other key to this is
we're going to have a

696
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
we're going to have a
 

697
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,629
we're going to have a
fern not a furnace a hopper filling the

698
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
fern not a furnace a hopper filling the
 

699
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,509
fern not a furnace a hopper filling the
mine cart

700
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
mine cart
 

701
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,550
mine cart
but as we saw hoppers are slow

702
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
but as we saw hoppers are slow
 

703
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,590
but as we saw hoppers are slow
so we need to make

704
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
so we need to make
 

705
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,790
so we need to make
many hoppers and distribute the load

706
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
many hoppers and distribute the load
 

707
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,069
many hoppers and distribute the load
among

708
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
among
 

709
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,710
among
all of them is the plan so what we got

710
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
all of them is the plan so what we got
 

711
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,470
all of them is the plan so what we got
to do is

712
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
to do is
 

713
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,110
to do is
something like this i think we'll mirror

714
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
something like this i think we'll mirror
 

715
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,269
something like this i think we'll mirror
it on this side as well oops

716
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
it on this side as well oops
 

717
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,750
it on this side as well oops
don't do that and then there's going to

718
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
don't do that and then there's going to
 

719
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,550
don't do that and then there's going to
be two

720
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
be two
 

721
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,430
be two
double chests here so i think which way

722
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
double chests here so i think which way
 

723
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,790
double chests here so i think which way
i think we want them this way

724
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
i think we want them this way
 

725
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,790
i think we want them this way
and then trap chest so we can place it

726
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
and then trap chest so we can place it
 

727
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,990
and then trap chest so we can place it
next to that

728
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
next to that
 

729
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,269
next to that
so the most hop or the

730
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
so the most hop or the
 

731
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,030
so the most hop or the
the maximum number of hoppers you can

732
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
the maximum number of hoppers you can
 

733
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,550
the maximum number of hoppers you can
put under a double chest is

734
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
put under a double chest is
 

735
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,590
put under a double chest is
two regular hoppers right so

736
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
two regular hoppers right so
 

737
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,590
two regular hoppers right so
that allows two items to be pulled out

738
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
that allows two items to be pulled out
 

739
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,910
that allows two items to be pulled out
at a time here instead of just one

740
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
at a time here instead of just one
 

741
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,790
at a time here instead of just one
so that makes it a little bit faster and

742
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
so that makes it a little bit faster and
 

743
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,949
so that makes it a little bit faster and
then we do that over here too

744
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
then we do that over here too
 

745
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,069
then we do that over here too
um let's see

746
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
um let's see
 

747
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,230
um let's see
but now in order to supply two items at

748
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
but now in order to supply two items at
 

749
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,310
but now in order to supply two items at
a time we need to connect two hoppers to

750
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
a time we need to connect two hoppers to
 

751
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,710
a time we need to connect two hoppers to
this

752
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
this
 

753
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,829
this
chest as well so to do that we're gonna

754
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
chest as well so to do that we're gonna
 

755
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,949
chest as well so to do that we're gonna
have one hopper here

756
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
have one hopper here
 

757
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,069
have one hopper here
one hopper there two total goes into two

758
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
one hopper there two total goes into two
 

759
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,069
one hopper there two total goes into two
down here

760
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
down here
 

761
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,790
down here
and we'll do that likewise two to this

762
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
and we'll do that likewise two to this
 

763
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,550
and we'll do that likewise two to this
one

764
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
one
 

765
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,910
one
and we do something like that okay

766
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
and we do something like that okay
 

767
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,150
and we do something like that okay
then we copy that again over here

768
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
then we copy that again over here
 

769
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,750
then we copy that again over here
and now that we've mirrored it this is

770
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
and now that we've mirrored it this is
 

771
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,230
and now that we've mirrored it this is
what it looks like so the whole point

772
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
what it looks like so the whole point
 

773
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,629
what it looks like so the whole point
of all this here pretty much is just to

774
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
of all this here pretty much is just to
 

775
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,230
of all this here pretty much is just to
create some distance

776
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
create some distance
 

777
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,670
create some distance
between the hoppers at the top there

778
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
between the hoppers at the top there
 

779
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,269
between the hoppers at the top there
like that hopper there

780
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
like that hopper there
 

781
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,949
like that hopper there
kind of just corresponds to that one

782
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
kind of just corresponds to that one
 

783
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,110
kind of just corresponds to that one
there that one there to that one there

784
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
there that one there to that one there
 

785
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,750
there that one there to that one there
that to that that to that that to that

786
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
that to that that to that that to that
 

787
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,590
that to that that to that that to that
the reason we want some distance between

788
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
the reason we want some distance between
 

789
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,509
the reason we want some distance between
these hoppers is so we can control them

790
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
these hoppers is so we can control them
 

791
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,590
these hoppers is so we can control them
hopper mine carts easily down there

792
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
hopper mine carts easily down there
 

793
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,990
hopper mine carts easily down there
uh if the eight harbor minecarts were

794
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
uh if the eight harbor minecarts were
 

795
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,430
uh if the eight harbor minecarts were
underneath these eight hoppers at the

796
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
underneath these eight hoppers at the
 

797
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,550
underneath these eight hoppers at the
top

798
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
top
 

799
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,030
top
how would we ever launch them we need

800
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
how would we ever launch them we need
 

801
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,870
how would we ever launch them we need
the blocks next to the hopper minecarts

802
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
the blocks next to the hopper minecarts
 

803
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,629
the blocks next to the hopper minecarts
to launch them right so

804
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
to launch them right so
 

805
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,629
to launch them right so
just makes it a lot easier to deal with

806
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
just makes it a lot easier to deal with
 

807
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,629
just makes it a lot easier to deal with
them and now what we're gonna do we're

808
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
them and now what we're gonna do we're
 

809
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,189
them and now what we're gonna do we're
gonna hop

810
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
gonna hop
 

811
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,710
gonna hop
on here and put in our splitter

812
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
on here and put in our splitter
 

813
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,910
on here and put in our splitter
main system thing so hopper mine cart

814
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
main system thing so hopper mine cart
 

815
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,590
main system thing so hopper mine cart
here we're gonna use two in total

816
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
here we're gonna use two in total
 

817
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,670
here we're gonna use two in total
and i believe these are four times

818
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
and i believe these are four times
 

819
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,670
and i believe these are four times
faster at picking up

820
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
faster at picking up
 

821
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,030
faster at picking up
items than regular hoppers i'm pretty

822
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
items than regular hoppers i'm pretty
 

823
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,230
items than regular hoppers i'm pretty
sure anyways

824
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
sure anyways
 

825
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,230
sure anyways
so this works out beautifully because

826
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
so this works out beautifully because
 

827
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,069
so this works out beautifully because
each hopper minecarts is going to go

828
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
each hopper minecarts is going to go
 

829
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,030
each hopper minecarts is going to go
into four regular hoppers

830
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
into four regular hoppers
 

831
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,470
into four regular hoppers
like so and then

832
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
like so and then
 

833
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,629
like so and then
what we want to do is put a chest above

834
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
what we want to do is put a chest above
 

835
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,110
what we want to do is put a chest above
these a double chest

836
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
these a double chest
 

837
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,230
these a double chest
to again uh speed it up here

838
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240

 

839
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,910

so i think we're going to put it right

840
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
so i think we're going to put it right
 

841
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,509
so i think we're going to put it right
here right

842
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
here right
 

843
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,550
here right
got to be careful how i nudge these so

844
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
got to be careful how i nudge these so
 

845
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,389
got to be careful how i nudge these so
above this one we're gonna have one side

846
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
above this one we're gonna have one side
 

847
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,430
above this one we're gonna have one side
of the chest

848
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
of the chest
 

849
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,949
of the chest
and then above this one the other side

850
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
and then above this one the other side
 

851
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,550
and then above this one the other side
of it

852
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
of it
 

853
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,269
of it
all right so the contents of this chest

854
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
all right so the contents of this chest
 

855
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,310
all right so the contents of this chest
should get split

856
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
should get split
 

857
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,350
should get split
using these hopper minecarts into

858
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
using these hopper minecarts into
 

859
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,990
using these hopper minecarts into
the eight hoppers we have down there

860
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
the eight hoppers we have down there
 

861
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,189
the eight hoppers we have down there
let's try it out

862
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
let's try it out
 

863
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,269
let's try it out
so if we put in a stack of stone bricks

864
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
so if we put in a stack of stone bricks
 

865
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,590
so if we put in a stack of stone bricks
you see how fast that empties too it's

866
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
you see how fast that empties too it's
 

867
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,949
you see how fast that empties too it's
so cool

868
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
so cool
 

869
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,069
so cool
so this should get eights no no

870
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
so this should get eights no no
 

871
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,550
so this should get eights no no
no okay these are not positioned

872
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
no okay these are not positioned
 

873
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,910
no okay these are not positioned
properly

874
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
properly
 

875
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,350
properly
which one's wrong

876
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360

 

877
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,310

so that got 16 that got 16 okay so they

878
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
so that got 16 that got 16 okay so they
 

879
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,509
so that got 16 that got 16 okay so they
all went to this side

880
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519

 

881
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,470

let's reposition this so this one for

882
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
let's reposition this so this one for
 

883
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,189
let's reposition this so this one for
some reason

884
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
some reason
 

885
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,269
some reason
must be too far away

886
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279

 

887
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,710

or is it because there's a block over

888
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
or is it because there's a block over
 

889
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,350
or is it because there's a block over
top does that matter

890
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
top does that matter
 

891
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,069
top does that matter
i don't think it does yeah that was

892
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
i don't think it does yeah that was
 

893
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,110
i don't think it does yeah that was
faster right

894
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
faster right
 

895
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,990
faster right
yeah that was pretty fast so now eight

896
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
yeah that was pretty fast so now eight
 

897
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,470
yeah that was pretty fast so now eight
in each of these

898
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
in each of these
 

899
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,189
in each of these
right yep looks good

900
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
right yep looks good
 

901
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,710
right yep looks good
all right so this will give you a better

902
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
all right so this will give you a better
 

903
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,789
all right so this will give you a better
idea of what we have to do here so that

904
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
idea of what we have to do here so that
 

905
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,470
idea of what we have to do here so that
that line there is for the fuel that's

906
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
that line there is for the fuel that's
 

907
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,990
that line there is for the fuel that's
for the items items

908
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
for the items items
 

909
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,189
for the items items
fuel fuel items items fuel is the way i

910
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
fuel fuel items items fuel is the way i
 

911
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,549
fuel fuel items items fuel is the way i
got this arranged

912
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
got this arranged
 

913
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,789
got this arranged
um this is where the floor of the

914
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
um this is where the floor of the
 

915
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,789
um this is where the floor of the
smeltery building is gonna be where we

916
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
smeltery building is gonna be where we
 

917
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,630
smeltery building is gonna be where we
are here so if we wanna smelt something

918
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
are here so if we wanna smelt something
 

919
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,029
are here so if we wanna smelt something
all we gotta do is look down

920
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
all we gotta do is look down
 

921
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,270
all we gotta do is look down
put in the chest and then it'll go into

922
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
put in the chest and then it'll go into
 

923
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,590
put in the chest and then it'll go into
the furnaces very quickly hopefully

924
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
the furnaces very quickly hopefully
 

925
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,990
the furnaces very quickly hopefully
is what we're trying to do let's check

926
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
is what we're trying to do let's check
 

927
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,070
is what we're trying to do let's check
out the speed of this by the way

928
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
out the speed of this by the way
 

929
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,070
out the speed of this by the way
now as we said before the only way to

930
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
now as we said before the only way to
 

931
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,070
now as we said before the only way to
unload a hopper minecart is with regular

932
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
unload a hopper minecart is with regular
 

933
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,549
unload a hopper minecart is with regular
hoppers right so we're limited by the

934
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
hoppers right so we're limited by the
 

935
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,310
hoppers right so we're limited by the
hopper speed still

936
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
hopper speed still
 

937
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,310
hopper speed still
so if we put 64 in here

938
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320

 

939
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,470

it still has that slow filling time on

940
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
it still has that slow filling time on
 

941
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,909
it still has that slow filling time on
this unfortunately

942
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
this unfortunately
 

943
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,669
this unfortunately
but we got to wait for it to get eight

944
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
but we got to wait for it to get eight
 

945
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,070
but we got to wait for it to get eight
items at at the very least i think

946
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
items at at the very least i think
 

947
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,669
items at at the very least i think
then we will send these hopper mine

948
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
then we will send these hopper mine
 

949
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,230
then we will send these hopper mine
carts off they'll run down this line

950
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
carts off they'll run down this line
 

951
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,150
carts off they'll run down this line
drop off one item to each of the

952
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
drop off one item to each of the
 

953
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,830
drop off one item to each of the
furnaces

954
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
furnaces
 

955
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,669
furnaces
and then bounce back to get pick up some

956
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
and then bounce back to get pick up some
 

957
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,470
and then bounce back to get pick up some
more items if they have 16 items in

958
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
more items if they have 16 items in
 

959
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,990
more items if they have 16 items in
they will drop off one item on the

960
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
they will drop off one item on the
 

961
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,990
they will drop off one item on the
return trip as well

962
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
return trip as well
 

963
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,590
return trip as well
which is fine as well um

964
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
which is fine as well um
 

965
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,870
which is fine as well um
yeah and then hopper mine carts will

966
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
yeah and then hopper mine carts will
 

967
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,190
yeah and then hopper mine carts will
drop

968
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
drop
 

969
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,830
drop
off fuel into these and then this one

970
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
off fuel into these and then this one
 

971
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,510
off fuel into these and then this one
over here will pick up the items so i

972
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
over here will pick up the items so i
 

973
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,669
over here will pick up the items so i
i smelted one thing here yeah you see

974
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
i smelted one thing here yeah you see
 

975
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,270
i smelted one thing here yeah you see
it's got some cracks stone in there

976
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
it's got some cracks stone in there
 

977
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,630
it's got some cracks stone in there
so if we send off the mine carts

978
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
so if we send off the mine carts
 

979
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,110
so if we send off the mine carts
they were silent that was weird you see

980
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
they were silent that was weird you see
 

981
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,150
they were silent that was weird you see
it picked up the

982
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
it picked up the
 

983
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,190
it picked up the
the crack stone put it in here um then

984
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
the crack stone put it in here um then
 

985
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,390
the crack stone put it in here um then
press this one to send them back

986
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
press this one to send them back
 

987
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,070
press this one to send them back
oh yeah and another cool thing about

988
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
oh yeah and another cool thing about
 

989
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,310
oh yeah and another cool thing about
this extra stuff we added here is it

990
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
this extra stuff we added here is it
 

991
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,150
this extra stuff we added here is it
gives us a lot of storage space because

992
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
gives us a lot of storage space because
 

993
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,470
gives us a lot of storage space because
we got four double chests over there

994
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
we got four double chests over there
 

995
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,590
we got four double chests over there
we can't just uh for example hook up a

996
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
we can't just uh for example hook up a
 

997
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,750
we can't just uh for example hook up a
hopper to this chest here

998
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
hopper to this chest here
 

999
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,590
hopper to this chest here
because then we're limited by the speed

1000
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
because then we're limited by the speed
 

1001
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,750
because then we're limited by the speed
of the hopper right so

1002
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
of the hopper right so
 

1003
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,789
of the hopper right so
they would funnel down way too slow

1004
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
they would funnel down way too slow
 

1005
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,789
they would funnel down way too slow
and you could only actually smelt like

1006
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
and you could only actually smelt like
 

1007
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,950
and you could only actually smelt like
one double chest of things

1008
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
one double chest of things
 

1009
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,310
one double chest of things
by doing it this way we

1010
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
by doing it this way we
 

1011
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,710
by doing it this way we
basically have storage for five double

1012
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
basically have storage for five double
 

1013
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,549
basically have storage for five double
chests plus all the hopper space and

1014
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
chests plus all the hopper space and
 

1015
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,150
chests plus all the hopper space and
and stuff like that so um the only

1016
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
and stuff like that so um the only
 

1017
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,070
and stuff like that so um the only
limiting factor to it is you got to wait

1018
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
limiting factor to it is you got to wait
 

1019
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,750
limiting factor to it is you got to wait
for the items to get out of this chest

1020
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
for the items to get out of this chest
 

1021
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,710
for the items to get out of this chest
before you can put more

1022
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
before you can put more
 

1023
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,029
before you can put more
more in but that happens very quickly i

1024
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
more in but that happens very quickly i
 

1025
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,270
more in but that happens very quickly i
don't think it's going to be a problem

1026
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
don't think it's going to be a problem
 

1027
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,110
don't think it's going to be a problem
and since we're dropping the items off

1028
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
and since we're dropping the items off
 

1029
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,029
and since we're dropping the items off
here to be smelted we probably want to

1030
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
here to be smelted we probably want to
 

1031
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,870
here to be smelted we probably want to
pick them up here

1032
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
pick them up here
 

1033
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,630
pick them up here
after they've been smelted too would be

1034
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
after they've been smelted too would be
 

1035
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,350
after they've been smelted too would be
ideal probably

1036
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
ideal probably
 

1037
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,549
ideal probably
two or three double chests here maybe

1038
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
two or three double chests here maybe
 

1039
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,029
two or three double chests here maybe
use hoppers then i'm not sure

1040
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039

 

1041
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,070

maybe not maybe not maybe we don't let's

1042
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
maybe not maybe not maybe we don't let's
 

1043
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,510
maybe not maybe not maybe we don't let's
just plan for one double chest and then

1044
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
just plan for one double chest and then
 

1045
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,150
just plan for one double chest and then
we'll try to improve it if we can

1046
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
we'll try to improve it if we can
 

1047
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,230
we'll try to improve it if we can
so to get the items up here i think

1048
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
so to get the items up here i think
 

1049
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,470
so to get the items up here i think
we're going to use dropper elevators

1050
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
we're going to use dropper elevators
 

1051
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,870
we're going to use dropper elevators
not water streams because they're

1052
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
not water streams because they're
 

1053
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,470
not water streams because they're
they're more reliable

1054
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
they're more reliable
 

1055
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,789
they're more reliable
and i think we can make them work faster

1056
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
and i think we can make them work faster
 

1057
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,669
and i think we can make them work faster
too

1058
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
too
 

1059
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,950
too
so from here where the minecart drops

1060
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
so from here where the minecart drops
 

1061
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,909
so from here where the minecart drops
the stuff off that's been smelted

1062
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
the stuff off that's been smelted
 

1063
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,350
the stuff off that's been smelted
where did that go it's in here

1064
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
where did that go it's in here
 

1065
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,549
where did that go it's in here
um i clicked on the wrong thing

1066
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
um i clicked on the wrong thing
 

1067
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,070
um i clicked on the wrong thing
yeah that'll go into here and then we

1068
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
yeah that'll go into here and then we
 

1069
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,149
yeah that'll go into here and then we
want to set up a dropper here i would

1070
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
want to set up a dropper here i would
 

1071
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:24,870
want to set up a dropper here i would
say and

1072
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
say and
 

1073
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,230
say and
here and then start a line of droppers

1074
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
here and then start a line of droppers
 

1075
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,270
here and then start a line of droppers
going down like this

1076
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
going down like this
 

1077
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,110
going down like this
and likewise on the other side they'll

1078
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
and likewise on the other side they'll
 

1079
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,830
and likewise on the other side they'll
be dropper oh

1080
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
be dropper oh
 

1081
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,270
be dropper oh
over here i hope you guys aren't too

1082
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
over here i hope you guys aren't too
 

1083
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,390
over here i hope you guys aren't too
bored by this

1084
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
bored by this
 

1085
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,549
bored by this
um we've been doing a lot of building

1086
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
um we've been doing a lot of building
 

1087
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,909
um we've been doing a lot of building
lately and some people have called me

1088
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
lately and some people have called me
 

1089
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,350
lately and some people have called me
out on it's like man you never do

1090
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
out on it's like man you never do
 

1091
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,230
out on it's like man you never do
technical builds anymore etho

1092
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
technical builds anymore etho
 

1093
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,510
technical builds anymore etho
so yeah today's a technical build day

1094
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
so yeah today's a technical build day
 

1095
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,270
so yeah today's a technical build day
i know it's not everybody's cup of tea

1096
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
i know it's not everybody's cup of tea
 

1097
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,669
i know it's not everybody's cup of tea
but yeah so this part of the build is a

1098
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
but yeah so this part of the build is a
 

1099
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,510
but yeah so this part of the build is a
little bit of a challenge as well

1100
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
little bit of a challenge as well
 

1101
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,430
little bit of a challenge as well
because we're gonna have to deal with a

1102
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
because we're gonna have to deal with a
 

1103
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,270
because we're gonna have to deal with a
whole bunch of items all at once so when

1104
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
whole bunch of items all at once so when
 

1105
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,230
whole bunch of items all at once so when
these

1106
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
these
 

1107
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,310
these
make their return they're going to start

1108
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
make their return they're going to start
 

1109
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,270
make their return they're going to start
dropping off eight

1110
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
dropping off eight
 

1111
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,149
dropping off eight
blocks that'll go into this dropper at

1112
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
blocks that'll go into this dropper at
 

1113
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,750
blocks that'll go into this dropper at
each of these stations eight of them in

1114
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
each of these stations eight of them in
 

1115
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,870
each of these stations eight of them in
total right

1116
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
total right
 

1117
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,510
total right
so we gotta send 64 items through the

1118
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
so we gotta send 64 items through the
 

1119
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,070
so we gotta send 64 items through the
droppers

1120
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
droppers
 

1121
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,549
droppers
very quickly that's why i want to double

1122
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
very quickly that's why i want to double
 

1123
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,750
very quickly that's why i want to double
up have like two

1124
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
up have like two
 

1125
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,990
up have like two
two chains of them uh i think that'll

1126
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
two chains of them uh i think that'll
 

1127
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,149
two chains of them uh i think that'll
help it out for one thing

1128
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
help it out for one thing
 

1129
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,549
help it out for one thing
and we'll all we gotta do i think is run

1130
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
and we'll all we gotta do i think is run
 

1131
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,789
and we'll all we gotta do i think is run
a redstone line like that across

1132
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
a redstone line like that across
 

1133
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,510
a redstone line like that across
and also make sure they reach these over

1134
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
and also make sure they reach these over
 

1135
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,110
and also make sure they reach these over
here

1136
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
here
 

1137
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,110
here
so that do something like that gotta

1138
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
so that do something like that gotta
 

1139
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,470
so that do something like that gotta
make sure it doesn't connect to the

1140
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
make sure it doesn't connect to the
 

1141
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,710
make sure it doesn't connect to the
wires up there so this is gonna get very

1142
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
wires up there so this is gonna get very
 

1143
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,669
wires up there so this is gonna get very
cramped in here

1144
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
cramped in here
 

1145
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,390
cramped in here
there'll be blocks running along there

1146
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
there'll be blocks running along there
 

1147
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,070
there'll be blocks running along there
that should be good

1148
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
that should be good
 

1149
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,830
that should be good
actually i think we may have just

1150
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
actually i think we may have just
 

1151
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,549
actually i think we may have just
created a bottleneck here i'm not sure

1152
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
created a bottleneck here i'm not sure
 

1153
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,470
created a bottleneck here i'm not sure
uh let's let's try this out because we

1154
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
uh let's let's try this out because we
 

1155
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,149
uh let's let's try this out because we
have eight

1156
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
have eight
 

1157
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,870
have eight
droppers converging into two that's bad

1158
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
droppers converging into two that's bad
 

1159
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,470
droppers converging into two that's bad
news

1160
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
news
 

1161
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,270
news
that is bad news that's a traffic jam so

1162
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
that is bad news that's a traffic jam so
 

1163
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,390
that is bad news that's a traffic jam so
when this would

1164
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
when this would
 

1165
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,149
when this would
return the items it'll drop off eight

1166
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
return the items it'll drop off eight
 

1167
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,149
return the items it'll drop off eight
blocks into each of these droppers

1168
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
blocks into each of these droppers
 

1169
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,669
blocks into each of these droppers
so we're gonna simulate that here we got

1170
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
so we're gonna simulate that here we got
 

1171
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,990
so we're gonna simulate that here we got
eight in each of these and when we flip

1172
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
eight in each of these and when we flip
 

1173
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,070
eight in each of these and when we flip
this uh comparator clock on

1174
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
this uh comparator clock on
 

1175
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,830
this uh comparator clock on
let's see how long it takes to unload

1176
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
let's see how long it takes to unload
 

1177
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,750
let's see how long it takes to unload
all this

1178
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
all this
 

1179
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,070
all this
and

1180
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080

 

1181
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,669

stop that's several seconds

1182
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
stop that's several seconds
 

1183
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,950
stop that's several seconds
several seconds um

1184
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
several seconds um
 

1185
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,310
several seconds um
maybe we changed some of these

1186
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
maybe we changed some of these
 

1187
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,830
maybe we changed some of these
like we could have four item elevators

1188
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
like we could have four item elevators
 

1189
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,669
like we could have four item elevators
so eight down to four it's still a

1190
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
so eight down to four it's still a
 

1191
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,190
so eight down to four it's still a
little bit of a bottleneck but it won't

1192
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
little bit of a bottleneck but it won't
 

1193
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,789
little bit of a bottleneck but it won't
be as bad

1194
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
be as bad
 

1195
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,149
be as bad
change this to go this way

1196
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
change this to go this way
 

1197
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,270
change this to go this way
you know on second thought here this

1198
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
you know on second thought here this
 

1199
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,950
you know on second thought here this
quad elevator might be a little bit

1200
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
quad elevator might be a little bit
 

1201
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,909
quad elevator might be a little bit
overkill

1202
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
overkill
 

1203
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,990
overkill
it'll shave two or three seconds off of

1204
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
it'll shave two or three seconds off of
 

1205
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,909
it'll shave two or three seconds off of
our overall smelting time like if we're

1206
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
our overall smelting time like if we're
 

1207
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,750
our overall smelting time like if we're
doing one stack of items that would be

1208
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
doing one stack of items that would be
 

1209
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,950
doing one stack of items that would be
nice

1210
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
nice
 

1211
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,230
nice
but if we're doing a whole bunch of

1212
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
but if we're doing a whole bunch of
 

1213
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,990
but if we're doing a whole bunch of
items like a chest full it's not going

1214
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
items like a chest full it's not going
 

1215
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,549
items like a chest full it's not going
to really affect

1216
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
to really affect
 

1217
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,270
to really affect
the smelting time by very much honestly

1218
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
the smelting time by very much honestly
 

1219
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,870
the smelting time by very much honestly
um

1220
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
um
 

1221
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,350
um
because it takes items 10 seconds to

1222
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
because it takes items 10 seconds to
 

1223
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,350
because it takes items 10 seconds to
smelt in a furnace so as long as we get

1224
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
smelt in a furnace so as long as we get
 

1225
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,350
smelt in a furnace so as long as we get
the items out of the furnace

1226
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
the items out of the furnace
 

1227
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,110
the items out of the furnace
up the elevator into the the storage

1228
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
up the elevator into the the storage
 

1229
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,750
up the elevator into the the storage
chest within those 10 seconds

1230
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
chest within those 10 seconds
 

1231
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,990
chest within those 10 seconds
it shouldn't be much of a problem so we

1232
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
it shouldn't be much of a problem so we
 

1233
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,750
it shouldn't be much of a problem so we
could probably get away with even one

1234
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
could probably get away with even one
 

1235
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,990
could probably get away with even one
item elevator but i might try to do two

1236
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
item elevator but i might try to do two
 

1237
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,870
item elevator but i might try to do two
or even four i'm not sure yet here is

1238
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
or even four i'm not sure yet here is
 

1239
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,310
or even four i'm not sure yet here is
the comment for today guys we're gonna

1240
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
the comment for today guys we're gonna
 

1241
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,590
the comment for today guys we're gonna
wrap up here it says

1242
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
wrap up here it says
 

1243
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,789
wrap up here it says
how is your headset situation now is it

1244
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
how is your headset situation now is it
 

1245
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,669
how is your headset situation now is it
better

1246
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
better
 

1247
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,990
better
or still a mess it is still a mess guys

1248
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
or still a mess it is still a mess guys
 

1249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,270
or still a mess it is still a mess guys
it is a disaster i tell ya i've tried

1250
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
it is a disaster i tell ya i've tried
 

1251
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,269
it is a disaster i tell ya i've tried
i think five to ten different headsets

1252
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
i think five to ten different headsets
 

1253
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,669
i think five to ten different headsets
now some of them i can't return to the

1254
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
now some of them i can't return to the
 

1255
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,310
now some of them i can't return to the
stores

1256
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
stores
 

1257
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,190
stores
they've all been terrible absolutely

1258
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
they've all been terrible absolutely
 

1259
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,310
they've all been terrible absolutely
terrible

1260
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
terrible
 

1261
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,070
terrible
uh i even bought one very good

1262
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
uh i even bought one very good
 

1263
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,230
uh i even bought one very good
microphone i bought an at2035 that's a

1264
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
microphone i bought an at2035 that's a
 

1265
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,630
microphone i bought an at2035 that's a
xlr microphone with an audio interface

1266
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
xlr microphone with an audio interface
 

1267
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,350
xlr microphone with an audio interface
and i've even downloaded software for it

1268
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
and i've even downloaded software for it
 

1269
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,230
and i've even downloaded software for it
so i can fine-tune my audio frequencies

1270
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
so i can fine-tune my audio frequencies
 

1271
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,350
so i can fine-tune my audio frequencies
in my voice

1272
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
in my voice
 

1273
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,350
in my voice
i want to sound more or less high pitch

1274
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
i want to sound more or less high pitch
 

1275
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,750
i want to sound more or less high pitch
and all that kind of stuff

1276
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
and all that kind of stuff
 

1277
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,830
and all that kind of stuff
but uh just couldn't get it to sound

1278
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
but uh just couldn't get it to sound
 

1279
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,510
but uh just couldn't get it to sound
very good i think maybe there's a

1280
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
very good i think maybe there's a
 

1281
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,269
very good i think maybe there's a
problem with my

1282
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
problem with my
 

1283
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,990
problem with my
my audio card in my computer here and

1284
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
my audio card in my computer here and
 

1285
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,590
my audio card in my computer here and
hopefully when i get a new computer it's

1286
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
hopefully when i get a new computer it's
 

1287
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,070
hopefully when i get a new computer it's
going to work

1288
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
going to work
 

1289
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,669
going to work
but i'm not sure and i don't want to

1290
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
but i'm not sure and i don't want to
 

1291
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,669
but i'm not sure and i don't want to
throw money at the situation

1292
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
throw money at the situation
 

1293
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,870
throw money at the situation
so until then i'm still using my

1294
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
so until then i'm still using my
 

1295
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,669
so until then i'm still using my
my two garbage they're not garbage the

1296
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
my two garbage they're not garbage the
 

1297
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,070
my two garbage they're not garbage the
microphone is awesome in the gt

1298
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
microphone is awesome in the gt
 

1299
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,510
microphone is awesome in the gt
330s or gx330s what i don't know what

1300
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
330s or gx330s what i don't know what
 

1301
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,470
330s or gx330s what i don't know what
they're called

1302
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
they're called
 

1303
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,190
they're called
um but the frame is broken on them i've

1304
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
um but the frame is broken on them i've
 

1305
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,630
um but the frame is broken on them i've
super glued them back together which

1306
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
super glued them back together which
 

1307
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,549
super glued them back together which
worked very good actually

1308
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
worked very good actually
 

1309
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,430
worked very good actually
um the padding on the the earphones has

1310
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
um the padding on the the earphones has
 

1311
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,430
um the padding on the the earphones has
fallen off so i've put kleenex around

1312
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
fallen off so i've put kleenex around
 

1313
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,470
fallen off so i've put kleenex around
them

1314
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
them
 

1315
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,830
them
and it looks very funny but it works

1316
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
and it looks very funny but it works
 

1317
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,269
and it looks very funny but it works
keeps my my ears comfortable and also

1318
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
keeps my my ears comfortable and also
 

1319
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,909
keeps my my ears comfortable and also
sometimes the speakers quit working but

1320
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
sometimes the speakers quit working but
 

1321
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,909
sometimes the speakers quit working but
if i adjust the volume on them they work

1322
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
if i adjust the volume on them they work
 

1323
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,470
if i adjust the volume on them they work
