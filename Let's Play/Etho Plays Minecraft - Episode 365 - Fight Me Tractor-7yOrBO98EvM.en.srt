when I'm designing it so today I also
put together this second book here which

480
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
put together this second book here which
 

481
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,800
put together this second book here which
we'll take a quick look at this is to

482
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:34,810
we'll take a quick look at this is to
 

483
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,860
we'll take a quick look at this is to
help me plan out the Nexus and like what

484
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:37,870
help me plan out the Nexus and like what
 

485
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,960
help me plan out the Nexus and like what
I want to store there and try organize

486
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:39,970
I want to store there and try organize
 

487
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,850
I want to store there and try organize
stuff into categories so I got like the

488
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:41,860
stuff into categories so I got like the
 

489
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,700
stuff into categories so I got like the
category names at the top here and then

490
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:44,710
category names at the top here and then
 

491
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,710
category names at the top here and then
maybe the list of items that we would

492
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
maybe the list of items that we would
 

493
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,080
maybe the list of items that we would
put in there and at the bottom here is

494
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,090
put in there and at the bottom here is
 

495
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,330
put in there and at the bottom here is
the total count for all the items in

496
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,340
the total count for all the items in
 

497
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,460
the total count for all the items in
that list so there's there's lots of the

498
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,470
that list so there's there's lots of the
 

499
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,710
that list so there's there's lots of the
spelling mistakes here and and other

500
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
spelling mistakes here and and other
 

501
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,860
spelling mistakes here and and other
mistakes so deep that in mind got dirt

502
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:58,870
mistakes so deep that in mind got dirt
 

503
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,740
mistakes so deep that in mind got dirt
wood I don't plan on storing every

504
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:01,750
wood I don't plan on storing every
 

505
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,630
wood I don't plan on storing every
single item in the game like I don't

506
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:03,640
single item in the game like I don't
 

507
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,300
single item in the game like I don't
want to store fence gates for example

508
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,310
want to store fence gates for example
 

509
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,620
want to store fence gates for example
because I don't really use those too

510
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:07,630
because I don't really use those too
 

511
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,250
because I don't really use those too
often

512
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,260
often
 

513
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,720
often
so I don't have them in the would list

514
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:10,730
so I don't have them in the would list
 

515
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,150
so I don't have them in the would list
here or like doors I pretty much make

516
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,160
here or like doors I pretty much make
 

517
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
here or like doors I pretty much make
that stuff on the spot when I need it

518
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,170
that stuff on the spot when I need it
 

519
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,990
that stuff on the spot when I need it
and then I don't store it you got sand

520
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,000
and then I don't store it you got sand
 

521
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,830
and then I don't store it you got sand
glass wool lots of odd blocks here some

522
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:23,840
glass wool lots of odd blocks here some
 

523
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,650
glass wool lots of odd blocks here some
of these are not where they should be

524
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:26,660
of these are not where they should be
 

525
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,860
of these are not where they should be
like I think courts should be moved to

526
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:31,870

 

527
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,540

where is it the ores category maybe it's

528
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,550
where is it the ores category maybe it's
 

529
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,490
where is it the ores category maybe it's
kind of hard to categorize everything in

530
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:39,500
kind of hard to categorize everything in
 

531
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,010
kind of hard to categorize everything in
a good way here like for example

532
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,020
a good way here like for example
 

533
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,650
a good way here like for example
redstone there's redstone ore and

534
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:44,660
redstone there's redstone ore and
 

535
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,420
redstone there's redstone ore and
redstone dust and that I also think that

536
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,430
redstone dust and that I also think that
 

537
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,360
redstone dust and that I also think that
should go under the ores but then I have

538
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,370
should go under the ores but then I have
 

539
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,220
should go under the ores but then I have
this redstone category and I would like

540
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,230
this redstone category and I would like
 

541
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,010
this redstone category and I would like
it under there too so when I build the

542
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,020
it under there too so when I build the
 

543
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,200
it under there too so when I build the
storage room I think the way to do it is

544
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,210
storage room I think the way to do it is
 

545
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,670
storage room I think the way to do it is
to have the Redstone group and the ores

546
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:00,680
to have the Redstone group and the ores
 

547
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,010
to have the Redstone group and the ores
group next to each other and then put

548
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,020
group next to each other and then put
 

549
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,050
group next to each other and then put
redstone in the middle between the two

550
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,060
redstone in the middle between the two
 

551
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,460
redstone in the middle between the two
that way it kind of falls under both and

552
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,470
that way it kind of falls under both and
 

553
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,340
that way it kind of falls under both and
yeah anyway so I added up all these

554
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,350
yeah anyway so I added up all these
 

555
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,740
yeah anyway so I added up all these
numbers of the things I think I'll store

556
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:14,750
numbers of the things I think I'll store
 

557
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,330
numbers of the things I think I'll store
I'm probably missing a few things from

558
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:16,340
I'm probably missing a few things from
 

559
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,880
I'm probably missing a few things from
this list though but it adds up to three

560
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:18,890
this list though but it adds up to three
 

561
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,780
this list though but it adds up to three
hundred and thirty items and with the

562
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:22,790
hundred and thirty items and with the
 

563
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,550
hundred and thirty items and with the
storage room I'm trying to keep it at

564
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
storage room I'm trying to keep it at
 

565
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,740
storage room I'm trying to keep it at
256 items maximum that is for technical

566
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:29,750
256 items maximum that is for technical
 

567
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,430
256 items maximum that is for technical
reasons

568
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,440
reasons
 

569
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,280
reasons
that's for material collection reasons

570
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,290
that's for material collection reasons
 

571
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,660
that's for material collection reasons
and also like lag reasons because if you

572
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:37,670
and also like lag reasons because if you
 

573
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,280
and also like lag reasons because if you
get too many hoppers going in the game

574
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,290
get too many hoppers going in the game
 

575
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,380
get too many hoppers going in the game
I'm gonna have like an auto sorting

576
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,390
I'm gonna have like an auto sorting
 

577
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm gonna have like an auto sorting
system for example and with the design

578
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,070
system for example and with the design
 

579
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,470
system for example and with the design
I'm planning it's gonna be at least

580
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm planning it's gonna be at least
 

581
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm planning it's gonna be at least
three hoppers per item so that's gonna

582
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,310
three hoppers per item so that's gonna
 

583
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,650
three hoppers per item so that's gonna
be 750 some hoppers if you're not

584
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:53,660
be 750 some hoppers if you're not
 

585
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,380
be 750 some hoppers if you're not
careful you can get a lot of leg and I

586
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,390
careful you can get a lot of leg and I
 

587
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,710
careful you can get a lot of leg and I
have to really plan this out I'm not

588
00:15:59,710 --> 00:15:59,720
have to really plan this out I'm not
 

589
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,300
have to really plan this out I'm not
gonna be building it by the man cave

590
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,310
gonna be building it by the man cave
 

591
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,950
gonna be building it by the man cave
because then this area would become

592
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:02,960
because then this area would become
 

593
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,570
because then this area would become
unplayable probably I have to pick

594
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:04,580
unplayable probably I have to pick
 

595
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,180
unplayable probably I have to pick
somewhere far away where it's well not

596
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,190
somewhere far away where it's well not
 

597
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,670
somewhere far away where it's well not
far away but it has to be unloaded these

598
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
far away but it has to be unloaded these
 

599
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,970
far away but it has to be unloaded these
two areas yeah so just some stuff in

600
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:15,980
two areas yeah so just some stuff in
 

601
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,210
two areas yeah so just some stuff in
mind also with the system I'm making

602
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,220
mind also with the system I'm making
 

603
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,990
mind also with the system I'm making
there's there's a gonna be some binary

604
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,000
there's there's a gonna be some binary
 

605
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,170
there's there's a gonna be some binary
stuff with it so I want it at 256 or

606
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,180
stuff with it so I want it at 256 or
 

607
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,060
stuff with it so I want it at 256 or
less so that I don't need an extra bit

608
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,070
less so that I don't need an extra bit
 

609
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,750
less so that I don't need an extra bit
which will make more sense later so I

610
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:31,760
which will make more sense later so I
 

611
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,850
which will make more sense later so I
think what we'll do

612
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:32,860
think what we'll do
 

613
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,520
think what we'll do
glass wool clay and dyes these are like

614
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,530
glass wool clay and dyes these are like
 

615
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,620
glass wool clay and dyes these are like
the rainbow items these add a lot to the

616
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:41,630
the rainbow items these add a lot to the
 

617
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,020
the rainbow items these add a lot to the
account I think we should have a special

618
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,030
account I think we should have a special
 

619
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,530
account I think we should have a special
area separate for those if we add up the

620
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:47,540
area separate for those if we add up the
 

621
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,510
area separate for those if we add up the
numbers from all these it's like 99 or

622
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:49,520
numbers from all these it's like 99 or
 

623
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,660
numbers from all these it's like 99 or
something so if we had a special spot

624
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:52,670
something so if we had a special spot
 

625
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,690
something so if we had a special spot
for them we would get our countdown to

626
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:54,700
for them we would get our countdown to
 

627
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,590
for them we would get our countdown to
231 which should work out okay cuz

628
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
231 which should work out okay cuz
 

629
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,410
231 which should work out okay cuz
that's under 256 okay guys so we are

630
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:05,420
that's under 256 okay guys so we are
 

631
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,439
that's under 256 okay guys so we are
going to move on to something else here

632
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:07,449
going to move on to something else here
 

633
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,380
going to move on to something else here
let me tell you my plan for a while now

634
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,390
let me tell you my plan for a while now
 

635
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,939
let me tell you my plan for a while now
I wanted to do some major above ground

636
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:15,949

changes like nuts like look at this if

638
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:18,829
changes like nuts like look at this if
 

639
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,939
changes like nuts like look at this if
we look around we got the planes biome

want to tear that down eventually I

664
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:52,940
want to tear that down eventually I
 

665
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,320
want to tear that down eventually I
don't know but I thought it would be

666
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,330
don't know but I thought it would be
 

667
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,510
don't know but I thought it would be
cool if we started doing like biome

668
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:58,520
cool if we started doing like biome
 

669
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,940
cool if we started doing like biome
enhancement around the place like for

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,100
example we got these planes let's plant
 

673
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,200
example we got these planes let's plant
some wheat fields maybe we will put some

674
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,210
some wheat fields maybe we will put some
 

675
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,420
some wheat fields maybe we will put some
random custom trees every so often maybe

676
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,430
random custom trees every so often maybe
 

677
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,540
random custom trees every so often maybe
some boulders on the ground maybe we

678
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:13,550
some boulders on the ground maybe we
 

679
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,850
some boulders on the ground maybe we
could add some like buildings like

680
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:15,860
could add some like buildings like
 

681
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,490
could add some like buildings like
windmills and stuff maybe little houses

682
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,500
windmills and stuff maybe little houses
 

683
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,160
windmills and stuff maybe little houses
like as we work on an area for a while

684
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,170
like as we work on an area for a while
 

685
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,450
like as we work on an area for a while
maybe we can start adding more and more

686
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:25,460
maybe we can start adding more and more
 

687
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,490
maybe we can start adding more and more
to it and like start adding buildings

688
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:27,500
to it and like start adding buildings
 

689
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,680
to it and like start adding buildings
just for the looks of it I don't know I

690
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:29,690
just for the looks of it I don't know I
 

691
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,740
just for the looks of it I don't know I
think that would be kind of cool though

692
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:31,750
think that would be kind of cool though
 

693
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,720
think that would be kind of cool though
then like for swamp biome so you could

694
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,730
then like for swamp biome so you could
 

695
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,760
then like for swamp biome so you could
build some dead tree look

696
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:36,770
build some dead tree look
 

697
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,170
build some dead tree look
stuff mountains we could have like

698
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,180
stuff mountains we could have like
 

699
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,290
stuff mountains we could have like
glaciers and snow overhangs and I don't

700
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:44,300
glaciers and snow overhangs and I don't
 

701
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,170
glaciers and snow overhangs and I don't
know [ __ ] I just want to do some some

702
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,180
know [ __ ] I just want to do some some
 

703
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,470
know [ __ ] I just want to do some some
cool stuff like that though just so our

704
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
cool stuff like that though just so our
 

705
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,710
cool stuff like that though just so our
world is a little nicer because we spend

706
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:53,720
world is a little nicer because we spend
 

707
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,770
world is a little nicer because we spend
a lot of time in the man cave and that

708
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:56,780
a lot of time in the man cave and that
 

709
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,150
a lot of time in the man cave and that
looks pretty cool I'm happy with that

710
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
looks pretty cool I'm happy with that
 

711
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,860
looks pretty cool I'm happy with that
but I also spend a lot of time

712
00:18:59,860 --> 00:18:59,870
but I also spend a lot of time
 

713
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,130
but I also spend a lot of time
above-ground and there's nothing I

714
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,140
above-ground and there's nothing I
 

715
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,550
above-ground and there's nothing I
really like about the above-ground - too

716
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,560
really like about the above-ground - too
 

717
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,870
really like about the above-ground - too
much except for that the you've been a

718
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
much except for that the you've been a
 

719
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,820
much except for that the you've been a
filled thing we've done a few things but

720
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:12,830
filled thing we've done a few things but
 

721
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,490
filled thing we've done a few things but
not as much as I would like so anyway

722
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:15,500
not as much as I would like so anyway
 

723
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,770
not as much as I would like so anyway
I'm gonna plant some wheat fields here

724
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:17,780
I'm gonna plant some wheat fields here
 

725
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,530
I'm gonna plant some wheat fields here
as the first step and then I'll be back

726
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:20,540
as the first step and then I'll be back
 

727
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,850
as the first step and then I'll be back
in a sec all right so we got a little

728
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:24,860
in a sec all right so we got a little
 

729
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,880
in a sec all right so we got a little
bit done here it's coming along it's

730
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:27,890
bit done here it's coming along it's
 

731
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,830
bit done here it's coming along it's
actually a lot it just doesn't look like

732
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
actually a lot it just doesn't look like
 

733
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
actually a lot it just doesn't look like
much it takes a long time oh man oh man

734
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:33,770
much it takes a long time oh man oh man
 

735
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,010
much it takes a long time oh man oh man
but I think we should keep doing it I

736
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,020
but I think we should keep doing it I
 

737
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,550
but I think we should keep doing it I
I'm excited about this so it's a lot of

738
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:42,560
I'm excited about this so it's a lot of
 

739
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,530
I'm excited about this so it's a lot of
wheat it's a crazy amount of wheat

740
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:44,540
wheat it's a crazy amount of wheat
 

741
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,650
wheat it's a crazy amount of wheat
honestly I'm not gonna do the whole

742
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:47,660
honestly I'm not gonna do the whole
 

743
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,550
honestly I'm not gonna do the whole
Plains biome like a wheat field but just

744
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,560
Plains biome like a wheat field but just
 

745
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,650
Plains biome like a wheat field but just
just a little bit of it I think and then

746
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:53,660
just a little bit of it I think and then
 

747
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,150
just a little bit of it I think and then
the idea is we're gonna add more and

748
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,160
the idea is we're gonna add more and
 

749
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,970
the idea is we're gonna add more and
more detail as we continue on here so we

750
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:57,980
more detail as we continue on here so we
 

751
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,890
more detail as we continue on here so we
we have the wheats right then we'll add

752
00:19:59,890 --> 00:19:59,900
we have the wheats right then we'll add
 

753
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,010
we have the wheats right then we'll add
like paths through it we'll add maybe

754
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,020
like paths through it we'll add maybe
 

755
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,330
like paths through it we'll add maybe
boulders I want it to try maybe having

756
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:07,340
boulders I want it to try maybe having
 

757
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,310
boulders I want it to try maybe having
some piles of hay every so often let's

758
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,320
some piles of hay every so often let's
 

759
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,430
some piles of hay every so often let's
see what that looks like

760
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
see what that looks like
 

761
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,230
see what that looks like
let's see where should we put one I'm

762
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,240
let's see where should we put one I'm
 

763
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,540
let's see where should we put one I'm
wondering though I like it mobs fall

764
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:19,550
wondering though I like it mobs fall
 

765
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,110
wondering though I like it mobs fall
down are they gonna trample this one of

766
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
down are they gonna trample this one of
 

767
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,480
down are they gonna trample this one of
my concerns maybe not okay maybe we will

768
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,490
my concerns maybe not okay maybe we will
 

769
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,750
my concerns maybe not okay maybe we will
put there's like gaps in this - I'm not

770
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
put there's like gaps in this - I'm not
 

771
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,550
put there's like gaps in this - I'm not
sure pressure make it solid wheats or if

772
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:33,560
sure pressure make it solid wheats or if
 

773
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,500
sure pressure make it solid wheats or if
it looks better with little patches

774
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,510
it looks better with little patches
 

775
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,670
it looks better with little patches
missing I'm not sure I don't know where

776
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:39,680
missing I'm not sure I don't know where
 

777
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,540
missing I'm not sure I don't know where
to put it

778
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:40,550
to put it
 

779
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,100
to put it
I don't know where to put this let's try

780
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,110
I don't know where to put this let's try
 

781
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,690
I don't know where to put this let's try
make a little pile any add like

782
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:46,700
make a little pile any add like
 

783
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,940
make a little pile any add like
scarecrows or who knows what there's

784
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:48,950
scarecrows or who knows what there's
 

785
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,470
scarecrows or who knows what there's
there's lots of little details we can

786
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
there's lots of little details we can
 

787
00:20:50,480 --> 00:21:01,330
there's lots of little details we can
add to this all right do that okay be a

788
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,340
add to this all right do that okay be a
 

789
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,360
add to this all right do that okay be a
pretty big pile okay

790
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,370
pretty big pile okay
 

791
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,540
pretty big pile okay
let's just see what one would look like
