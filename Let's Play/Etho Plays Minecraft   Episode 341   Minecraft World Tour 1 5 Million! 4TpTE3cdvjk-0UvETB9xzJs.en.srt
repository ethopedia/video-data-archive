sheep farm i built as well this is
 

609
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,750
sheep farm i built as well this is
actually

610
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760

618
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
effect it's got going on it's kind of
 

619
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,509
effect it's got going on it's kind of
cool um

620
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
cool um
 

621
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,550
cool um
and there's lots of intricate details to

622
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
and there's lots of intricate details to
 

623
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,910
and there's lots of intricate details to
making it work here

624
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
making it work here
 

625
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,829
making it work here
so what you do you just run along it's

626
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
so what you do you just run along it's
 

627
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,590
so what you do you just run along it's
not very efficient though

628
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
not very efficient though
 

629
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,430
not very efficient though
i will say that this is not designed to

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
i will say that this is not designed to
 

631
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,790
i will say that this is not designed to
be efficient

632
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
be efficient
 

633
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,670
be efficient
uh i call it my pop-up sheep farm by the

634
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
uh i call it my pop-up sheep farm by the
 

635
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,870
uh i call it my pop-up sheep farm by the
way

636
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
way
 

637
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,910
way
so so uh oh you just saw it there

638
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
so so uh oh you just saw it there
 

639
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,870
so so uh oh you just saw it there
actually

640
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
actually
 

641
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,910
actually
uh when the sheep regrow their wool they

642
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
uh when the sheep regrow their wool they
 

643
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,470
uh when the sheep regrow their wool they
pop up and then the light turns on and

644
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
pop up and then the light turns on and
 

645
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,550
pop up and then the light turns on and
you know they're ready to go

646
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
you know they're ready to go
 

647
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,670
you know they're ready to go
when you harvest or harvest

650
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
that sounds so wrong when you when you
 

651
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,190
that sounds so wrong when you when you
clip them

652
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
clip them
 

653
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,470

655
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,230
you don't harvest the sheep you can push
that to manually drop them down if you

656
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
that to manually drop them down if you
 

657
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,269
that to manually drop them down if you
want

658

or there's like a master control switch

660
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
or there's like a master control switch
 

661
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,509
or there's like a master control switch
at the start of the farm which i usually

662
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
at the start of the farm which i usually
 

663
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,750
at the start of the farm which i usually
use

664
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
use
 

665
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,829
use
this at the end here this is in case

666
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
this at the end here this is in case
 

667
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,230
this at the end here this is in case
i've never used this before actually

668
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
i've never used this before actually
 

669
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,230
i've never used this before actually
i kind of doubt it works still even

670
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
i kind of doubt it works still even
 

671
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,350
i kind of doubt it works still even
this is in case one of the sheep dies i

672

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,870
it keeps the shape
so if this updates the whole river gets

1178
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
so if this updates the whole river gets
 

1179
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,390
so if this updates the whole river gets
messed up

1180
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
messed up
 

1181
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,990
messed up
um and since we're on a backup i might

1182
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
um and since we're on a backup i might
 

1183
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,710
um and since we're on a backup i might
just do it just to see it

1184
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
just do it just to see it
 

1185
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,909
just do it just to see it
i've never done that before oh man

1186
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919

 

1187
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,430

oh what a mess i had to be really

1188
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
oh what a mess i had to be really
 

1189
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,870
oh what a mess i had to be really
careful when i made this like that the

1190
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
careful when i made this like that the
 

1191
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,510
careful when i made this like that the
grass

1192
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
grass
 

1193
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,669
grass
was all grown before i melted the ice

1194
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
was all grown before i melted the ice
 

1195
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,190
was all grown before i melted the ice
blocks otherwise

1196
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
blocks otherwise
 

1197
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,710
blocks otherwise
the grass drawing would cause it to

1198
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
the grass drawing would cause it to
 

1199
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,270
the grass drawing would cause it to
update and yeah

1200
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
update and yeah
 

1201
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,029

1205
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,549
i made this back when you had to hoe
or you had to till the soil for it to

1206
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
or you had to till the soil for it to
 

1207
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,070
or you had to till the soil for it to
grow on it

1208
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
grow on it
 

1209
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,430
grow on it
which you don't have to do anymore and i

1210
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
which you don't have to do anymore and i
 

1211
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,110
which you don't have to do anymore and i
had a dispenser back here with a

1212
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
had a dispenser back here with a
 

1213
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,630
had a dispenser back here with a
with a hole in it that would shoot out

1214
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
with a hole in it that would shoot out
 

1215
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,830
with a hole in it that would shoot out
when you'd walk in

1216
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840

 

1217
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,110

i've used this farm a lot

1218
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
i've used this farm a lot
 

1219
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,549
i've used this farm a lot
oh and it's full this is my spider farm

1220
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
oh and it's full this is my spider farm
 

1221
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,310
oh and it's full this is my spider farm
again i made this one enchanting came

1222
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
again i made this one enchanting came
 

1223
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,230
again i made this one enchanting came
out and it's like how do you get 50

1224
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
out and it's like how do you get 50
 

1225
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,909
out and it's like how do you get 50
levels

1226
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
levels
 

1227
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,549
levels
i don't know and i had the idea of using

1228
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
i don't know and i had the idea of using
 

1229
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,390
i don't know and i had the idea of using
cave spider spawners

1230
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
cave spider spawners
 

1231
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,669
cave spider spawners
there's one below here and there's

1232
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
there's one below here and there's
 

1233
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,070
there's one below here and there's
another one over there

1234
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,080
another one over there
 

1235
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,110
another one over there
um and that was a lot of fun

1236
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
um and that was a lot of fun
 

1237
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,750
um and that was a lot of fun
because i they would kill me a lot and

1238
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
because i they would kill me a lot and
 

1239
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,750
because i they would kill me a lot and
they would run around my cave and

1240
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
they would run around my cave and
 

1241
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,710
they would run around my cave and
torture me and uh eventually though i

1242
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
torture me and uh eventually though i
 

1243
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,990
torture me and uh eventually though i
came up with a way

1244
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
came up with a way
 

1245
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,269
came up with a way
of moving them upwards this is a as an

1246
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
of moving them upwards this is a as an
 

1247
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,269
of moving them upwards this is a as an
elevator for cave spiders which probably

1248
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
elevator for cave spiders which probably
 

1249
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,110
elevator for cave spiders which probably
doesn't work anymore

1250
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
doesn't work anymore
 

1251
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,230
doesn't work anymore
it like goes up this way

1252
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
it like goes up this way
 

1253
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,710
it like goes up this way
and then up to here and then they would

1254
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
and then up to here and then they would
 

1255
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,470
and then up to here and then they would
drop down and take

1256
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
drop down and take
 

1257
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,230
drop down and take
just enough damage to get them down to a

1258
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
just enough damage to get them down to a
 

1259
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,430
just enough damage to get them down to a
one-hit kill

1260
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440

 

1261
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,950

these were timers i don't think they

1262
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
these were timers i don't think they
 

1263
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,149
these were timers i don't think they
work anymore

1264
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159

 

1265
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,590

probably not um

1266
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
probably not um
 

1267
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,149
probably not um
all right what else what else this is

1268
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
all right what else what else this is
 

1269
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,750
all right what else what else this is
for the slime farm

1270
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
for the slime farm
 

1271
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,390
for the slime farm
slimes get separated by their sizes we

1272
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
slimes get separated by their sizes we
 

1273
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,870
slimes get separated by their sizes we
got the slime

1274
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
got the slime
 

1275
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,830
got the slime
slime evader over here to bring them up

1276
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
slime evader over here to bring them up
 

1277
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,590
slime evader over here to bring them up
um and then

1278
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
um and then
 

1279
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,230
um and then
i had a thing before which doesn't work

1280
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
i had a thing before which doesn't work
 

1281
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,750
i had a thing before which doesn't work
anymore whoa

1282
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
anymore whoa
 

1283
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,190
anymore whoa
you see the mine carts there though they

1284
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
you see the mine carts there though they
 

1285
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,390
you see the mine carts there though they
would pick up the big slimes

1286
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
would pick up the big slimes
 

1287
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,669
would pick up the big slimes
automatically and then it would uh

1288
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
automatically and then it would uh
 

1289
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,110
automatically and then it would uh
bring them to this tree farm area and

1290
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
bring them to this tree farm area and
 

1291
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,029
bring them to this tree farm area and
they would go around and around

1292
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
they would go around and around
 

1293
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,070
they would go around and around
the tree farm just for the fun of it

1294
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
the tree farm just for the fun of it
 

1295
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,070
the tree farm just for the fun of it
which i need to fix eventually

1296
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080

 

1297
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,590

okay let's keep going here uh this

1298
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
okay let's keep going here uh this
 

1299
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,430
okay let's keep going here uh this
this is probably the most out of place

1300
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
this is probably the most out of place
 

1301
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,149
this is probably the most out of place

1304
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
it's made out of brick the only thing
 

1305
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,590
it's made out of brick the only thing

made out of brick here
 

1307
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,870
made out of brick here
uh it's super ugly it's got

1308
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
uh it's super ugly it's got
 

1309
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,950
uh it's super ugly it's got
it's like the purpose of it is this

1310
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
it's like the purpose of it is this
 

1311
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,789
it's like the purpose of it is this
infinite water source and the crafting

1312
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
infinite water source and the crafting
 

1313
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,470
infinite water source and the crafting
table but like i'll just

1314
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
table but like i'll just
 

1315
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,149

00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
if i need to craft something i'll just
 

1317
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,510

totally oblivious that it even exists

1320
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
totally oblivious that it even exists
 

1321
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,990
totally oblivious that it even exists
so i guess that's kind of good even

1322
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
so i guess that's kind of good even
 

1323
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,350
so i guess that's kind of good even
though it's ugly i don't notice it

1324
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
though it's ugly i don't notice it
 

1325
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,390
though it's ugly i don't notice it
anymore

1326
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
anymore
 

1327
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,350
anymore
and i don't think about it until today

1328
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
and i don't think about it until today
 

1329
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,430
and i don't think about it until today
now i want to rip it out

1330
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
now i want to rip it out
 

1331
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,710
now i want to rip it out
uh cows fall down here from this

1332

if we go up there's a bunch of fishing

1336
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
if we go up there's a bunch of fishing
 

1337
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,029

rods up here

1338
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
rods up here
 

1339
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,789
rods up here

um all right we got the desert over here
recently we started building this mob

2330
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
recently we started building this mob
 

2331
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,990
recently we started building this mob
system that needs to

2332
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
system that needs to
 

2333
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,750
system that needs to
be finished up and made look

2334
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
be finished up and made look
 

2335
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,470
be finished up and made look
made to look nicer on the outside got my

2336
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
made to look nicer on the outside got my
 

2337
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,109
made to look nicer on the outside got my
giant sugar chain farm here this was for

2338
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
giant sugar chain farm here this was for
 

2339
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,990
giant sugar chain farm here this was for
when villager trading just came out i

2340
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
when villager trading just came out i
 

2341
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,510
when villager trading just came out i
was pretty quick to

2342
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
was pretty quick to
 

2343
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,630
was pretty quick to
exploit it and trade tons of paper with

2344
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
exploit it and trade tons of paper with
 

2345
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,150
exploit it and trade tons of paper with
the villagers

2346
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,160
the villagers
 

2347
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,150
the villagers
but i never ended up using those uh

2348
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
but i never ended up using those uh
 

2349
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,349
but i never ended up using those uh
emeralds

2350
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:49,359
emeralds
 

2351
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,589
emeralds
for uh like buying diamond stuff or

2352
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
for uh like buying diamond stuff or
 

2353
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,470
for uh like buying diamond stuff or
anything i use them for building

2354
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
anything i use them for building
 

2355
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,790
anything i use them for building
this is a well with a button on

2356
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
this is a well with a button on
 

2357
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,630
this is a well with a button on
surprisingly not too many people have

2358
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
surprisingly not too many people have
 

2359
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,910
surprisingly not too many people have
ever commented about this

2360
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:01,920
ever commented about this
 

2361
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,150
ever commented about this
even though uh that when i uh

2362
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
even though uh that when i uh
 

2363
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,150
even though uh that when i uh
when i made this world these wells

2364
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
when i made this world these wells
 

2365
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,670
when i made this world these wells
weren't auto generating

2366
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
weren't auto generating
 

2367
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,589
weren't auto generating
like this is before these wells even

2368
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
like this is before these wells even
 

2369
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,190
like this is before these wells even
existed so

2370
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
existed so
 

2371
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,630
existed so
i'm a little surprised not too many

2372
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
i'm a little surprised not too many
 

2373
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,670
i'm a little surprised not too many
people ask about that to be honest

2374
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
people ask about that to be honest
 

2375
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,270
people ask about that to be honest
and how many wells do you know have live

2376
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
and how many wells do you know have live
 

2377
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,069
and how many wells do you know have live
in that's that's just crazy

2378
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
in that's that's just crazy
 

2379
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,309
in that's that's just crazy
um this is a river i kind of custom made

2380
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,319
um this is a river i kind of custom made
 

2381
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,309
um this is a river i kind of custom made
it's actually a pretty nice boat ride

2382
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
it's actually a pretty nice boat ride
 

2383
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,750
it's actually a pretty nice boat ride
which we probably don't have time to

2384
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
which we probably don't have time to
 

2385
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,950
which we probably don't have time to
check out

2386
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:30,960
check out
 

2387
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,309
check out
but uh yeah

2388
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
but uh yeah
 

2389
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,990
but uh yeah
got trees all along the coast oh man i'm

2390
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
got trees all along the coast oh man i'm
 

2391
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,430
got trees all along the coast oh man i'm
going to crash it

2392
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440

 

2393
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,270

this also just runs right outside the

2394
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
this also just runs right outside the
 

2395
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,829
this also just runs right outside the
man cave

2396
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
man cave
 

2397
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,750
man cave
got a nice cool waterfall there that i

2398
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
got a nice cool waterfall there that i
 

2399
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,870
got a nice cool waterfall there that i
made

2400
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880

 

2401
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,230

every now and then i like to just do

2402
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240
every now and then i like to just do
 

2403
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,309
every now and then i like to just do
terraforming outside

2404
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:54,319
terraforming outside
 

2405
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,069
terraforming outside
as a nice change of pace

2406
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,079

 

2407
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,829

pretty cool and then it goes

2408
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
pretty cool and then it goes
 

2409
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,150
pretty cool and then it goes
this is a custom-made overhang i did

2410
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
this is a custom-made overhang i did
 

2411
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,670
this is a custom-made overhang i did
oops

2412

totally like there was no overhang there
 

2421
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,829
totally like there was no overhang there
before i built that

2422
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:18,839

 

2423
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,510

um let's see

2424
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
um let's see
 

2425
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,190
um let's see
i guess we'll head out this way i got a

2426
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:23,200
i guess we'll head out this way i got a
 

2427
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,109
i guess we'll head out this way i got a
few things built here nothing too fancy

2428
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119

 

2429
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,270

hmm yeah there's not a lot to see out

2430
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
hmm yeah there's not a lot to see out
 

2431
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,790
hmm yeah there's not a lot to see out
here but uh

2432
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
here but uh
 

2433
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,230
here but uh
just for a frame of reference the

2434
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
just for a frame of reference the
 

2435
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,990
just for a frame of reference the
library is up on that mountain

2436
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
library is up on that mountain
 

2437
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,549
library is up on that mountain
over there then in this desert we have

2438
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
over there then in this desert we have
 

2439
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,710
over there then in this desert we have
my obsidian farm

2440
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
my obsidian farm
 

2441
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,510
my obsidian farm
with this self closing portal you go in

2442
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
with this self closing portal you go in
 

2443
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,150
with this self closing portal you go in
it and it closes behind you

2444
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
it and it closes behind you
 

2445
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,990
it and it closes behind you
and then when you come back through here

2446
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
and then when you come back through here
 

2447
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,589
and then when you come back through here
it'll create a new portal every time and

2448
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
it'll create a new portal every time and
 

2449
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,790
it'll create a new portal every time and
you can

2450
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
you can
 

2451
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,390
you can
mine it out for the obsidian which is

2452
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
mine it out for the obsidian which is
 

2453
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,109
mine it out for the obsidian which is
cool this is also where i showed that

2454
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
cool this is also where i showed that
 

2455
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,549
cool this is also where i showed that
speed mining technique

2456
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
speed mining technique
 

2457
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,950
speed mining technique
originally down there is my mine shaft

2458
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
originally down there is my mine shaft
 

2459
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,670
originally down there is my mine shaft
where i got a lot of my redstone

2460
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
where i got a lot of my redstone
 

2461
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,790
where i got a lot of my redstone
and then over here a lot of people told

2462
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
and then over here a lot of people told
 

2463
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,349
and then over here a lot of people told
me

2464
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359
me
 

2465
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,270
me
they really liked this episode that i

2466
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
they really liked this episode that i
 

2467
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,950
they really liked this episode that i
did this and then a lot of people told

2468
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
did this and then a lot of people told
 

2469
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,870
did this and then a lot of people told
me they really hated that episode so

2470
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:08,880
me they really hated that episode so
 

2471
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,990
me they really hated that episode so
it's like

2472
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
it's like
 

2473
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,510
it's like
this was an idea some people really

2474
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,520
this was an idea some people really
 

2475
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,589
this was an idea some people really
liked and some didn't

2476
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
liked and some didn't
 

2477
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,910
liked and some didn't
but this was a project where i

2478
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:17,920
but this was a project where i
 

2479
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,910
but this was a project where i
think i started with like a stack of

2480
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:19,920
think i started with like a stack of
 

2481
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,670
think i started with like a stack of
tracks or something

2482
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
tracks or something
 

2483
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,630
tracks or something
and this was my attempt at realistic

2484
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
and this was my attempt at realistic
 

2485
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,470
and this was my attempt at realistic
mining like

2486
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
mining like
 

2487
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,630
mining like
i pretended like places that looked like

2488
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
i pretended like places that looked like
 

2489
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,990
i pretended like places that looked like
they could cave in i would put up a

2490
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,000
they could cave in i would put up a
 

2491
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,829
they could cave in i would put up a
support beam and

2492
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
support beam and
 

2493
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,910
support beam and
i tried to make it look really organic

2494
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
i tried to make it look really organic
 

2495
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,309
i tried to make it look really organic
like a like a mine shaft

2496
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
like a like a mine shaft
 

2497
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,670
like a like a mine shaft
and i put up like fenced areas if mobs

2498
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
and i put up like fenced areas if mobs
 

2499
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,750
and i put up like fenced areas if mobs
hostile mobs could spawn behind there as

2500
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
hostile mobs could spawn behind there as
 

2501
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,349
hostile mobs could spawn behind there as
a safety and

2502
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
a safety and
 

2503
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,390
a safety and
yeah lots of silly things and the goal

2504
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
yeah lots of silly things and the goal
 

2505
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,109
yeah lots of silly things and the goal
was kind of to see how far i could get

2506
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119

 

2507
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,710

mining like this

2508
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720

 

2509
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,349

by converting all the iron i find into

2510
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
by converting all the iron i find into
 

2511
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,470
by converting all the iron i find into
tracks and see how far they'll take me

2512
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
tracks and see how far they'll take me
 

2513
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,630
tracks and see how far they'll take me
and then basically if i ran out of iron

2514
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
and then basically if i ran out of iron
 

2515
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,470
and then basically if i ran out of iron
that would end my journey

2516
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
that would end my journey
 

2517
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,230
that would end my journey
because the mine shaft wasn't very

2518
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
because the mine shaft wasn't very
 

2519
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,069
because the mine shaft wasn't very
profitable

2520
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
profitable
 

2521
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,990
profitable
it goes outside this ravine though i

2522
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
it goes outside this ravine though i
 

2523
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,910
it goes outside this ravine though i
actually ended up getting pretty far

2524
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920

 

2525
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,069

i came back here too after the episode

2526
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:16,079
i came back here too after the episode
 

2527
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,910
i came back here too after the episode
and ended a little more

2528
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
and ended a little more
 

2529
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,190
and ended a little more

i think i ran out of iron

2540
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
i think i ran out of iron
 

2541
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,230

i am kind of i was hoping to keep it
 

2557
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,589
i am kind of i was hoping to keep it
under an hour but it's not looking

2558
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:55,599
under an hour but it's not looking
 

2559

2561
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,790
too good uh so far but anyway let's keep
going we're back at the man cave

2562
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:00,800
going we're back at the man cave
 

2563
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,069
going we're back at the man cave
through the creeper face oh that

2564
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
through the creeper face oh that
 

2565
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,150
through the creeper face oh that
clicking is a snowball fountain

2566
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,160
clicking is a snowball fountain
 

2567
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,950
clicking is a snowball fountain
through the creeper face is a portal

2568
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:10,960
through the creeper face is a portal
 

2569
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,829
through the creeper face is a portal
let's go on

2570
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
let's go on
 

2571
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,870
let's go on
in this takes us to the nether hub

2572
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880

 

2573
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,109

and just today actually i set this up

2574
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:19,119
and just today actually i set this up
 

2575
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,910
and just today actually i set this up
this is part of the portal network which

2576
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
this is part of the portal network which
 

2577
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,470
this is part of the portal network which
i might

2578
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
i might
 

2579
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,230
i might
i might explain in just a little bit

2580
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240

 

2581
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,069

um yeah it seems to work okay though

2582
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
um yeah it seems to work okay though
 

2583
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,910
um yeah it seems to work okay though
down this way goes to a mesa biome and

2584
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
down this way goes to a mesa biome and
 

2585
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,230
down this way goes to a mesa biome and
and some other stuff mostly i use this

2586
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240
and some other stuff mostly i use this
 

2587
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,710
and some other stuff mostly i use this
for resources nothing too fancy

2588
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
for resources nothing too fancy
 

2589
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,910
for resources nothing too fancy
uh we have

2590
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
uh we have
 

2591
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,549
uh we have
a couple portals that way i think again

2592
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
a couple portals that way i think again
 

2593
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,150
a couple portals that way i think again
for resources

2594
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
for resources
 

2595
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,470
for resources
and same with that way nothing really

2596
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
and same with that way nothing really
 

2597
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,430
and same with that way nothing really
built

2598
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:49,440
built
 

2599
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,630
built
up here this this is an elevator oops

2600
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640

 

2601
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,270

at this level we reached the gold farm

2602
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
at this level we reached the gold farm
 

2603
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,150
at this level we reached the gold farm
this thing was i spent a lot of time on

2604
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
this thing was i spent a lot of time on
 

2605
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,950
this thing was i spent a lot of time on
this thing it

2606
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
this thing it
 

2607
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,190
this thing it
is pretty cool but i i spent a lot of

2608
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200
is pretty cool but i i spent a lot of
 

2609
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,309
is pretty cool but i i spent a lot of
time on it

2610
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
time on it
 

2611
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,630
time on it
uh we got a giant cage to protect the

2612
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
uh we got a giant cage to protect the
 

2613
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,390
uh we got a giant cage to protect the
whole thing from gas

2614
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
whole thing from gas
 

2615
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,510
whole thing from gas
and i tried to add a like some

2616
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
and i tried to add a like some
 

2617
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,670
and i tried to add a like some
somewhat of a design to it so it wasn't

2618
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680
somewhat of a design to it so it wasn't
 

2619
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,390
somewhat of a design to it so it wasn't
just solid iron bars or something

2620
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
just solid iron bars or something
 

2621
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,670
just solid iron bars or something
it took a ton of iron too but

2622
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
it took a ton of iron too but
 

2623
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,549
it took a ton of iron too but
got that done and then each of these

2624
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
got that done and then each of these
 

2625
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:24,950
got that done and then each of these
things

2626
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:24,960
things
 

2627
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,790
things
is like a spawning pad for the zombie

2628
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
is like a spawning pad for the zombie
 

2629

pigmen they fall down
 

2631
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,750
pigmen they fall down
or they get pushed down by pistons they

2632
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:31,760
or they get pushed down by pistons they
 

2633
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,190
or they get pushed down by pistons they
go into the portal and they end up at

2634
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
go into the portal and they end up at
 

2635
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,670
go into the portal and they end up at
the gold farm on the other side

2636
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:35,680
the gold farm on the other side
 

2637
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,069
the gold farm on the other side
causes a tremendous amount of lag you

2638
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:38,079
causes a tremendous amount of lag you
 

2639
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,990
causes a tremendous amount of lag you
should not build anything like this

2640
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
should not build anything like this
 

2641
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,829
should not build anything like this
in multiplayer servers but if we go up

2642
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
in multiplayer servers but if we go up
 

2643
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,790
in multiplayer servers but if we go up
further

2644
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
further
 

2645
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,270
further
see what's here is there anything here

2646
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280

uh this goes all the way up to the top
of the nether though

00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
of the nether though
 

2655
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,710
of the nether though
i hear a guest

2656
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:02,720

 

2657
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,390

2660
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:09,359
then this is a timer thing that lets you
 

2661
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,790
then this is a timer thing that lets you
uh you put you push this button here and

2662
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
uh you put you push this button here and
 

2663
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,230
uh you put you push this button here and
then you stand here and it will push you

2664
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
then you stand here and it will push you
 

2665
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,309
then you stand here and it will push you
down after a certain amount of time

2666
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
down after a certain amount of time
 

2667
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,790
down after a certain amount of time
that a good amount of zombie pigmen have

2668
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:18,800
that a good amount of zombie pigmen have
 

2669
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,069
that a good amount of zombie pigmen have
spawned and then you go

2670
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
spawned and then you go
 

2671
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,790
spawned and then you go
down and you go kill them

2672
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800

 

2673
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,309

okay so we're back to the nether hub

2674
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
okay so we're back to the nether hub
 

2675
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,470
okay so we're back to the nether hub
here usually if i come to the nether

2676
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
here usually if i come to the nether
 

2677
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,950
here usually if i come to the nether
it's to go down this tunnel

2678
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
it's to go down this tunnel
 

2679
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,190
it's to go down this tunnel
this takes us to our stronghold base and

2680
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
this takes us to our stronghold base and
 

2681
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,990
this takes us to our stronghold base and
a few other things

2682
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
a few other things
 

2683
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,270
a few other things
by the way this was a minecarts

2684
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
by the way this was a minecarts
 

2685
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,030
by the way this was a minecarts
selector system destination selector

2686
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,040
selector system destination selector
 

2687
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,950
selector system destination selector
which i never really hooked up and

2688
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:44,960
which i never really hooked up and
 

2689
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,589
which i never really hooked up and
probably never will

2690
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
probably never will
 

2691
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,670
probably never will
and there's a there's an access room

2692
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
and there's a there's an access room
 

2693
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,309
and there's a there's an access room
back there for the wiring this tunnel

00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
back there for the wiring this tunnel
 

2695
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,069
back there for the wiring this tunnel
goes to the stronghold though let's go

2696
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:56,079
goes to the stronghold though let's go
 

2697
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,150
goes to the stronghold though let's go
check it out

2698
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,160
check it out
 

2699
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,510
check it out
um it's not too far usually i just run

2700
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:01,520
um it's not too far usually i just run
 

2701
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,990
um it's not too far usually i just run
it in fact

2702
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,000
it in fact
 

2703
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,910
it in fact
oh yeah right over here

2704
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:07,920
oh yeah right over here
 

2705
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,030
oh yeah right over here
and we got a few other things here too

2706
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
and we got a few other things here too
 

2707
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,190
and we got a few other things here too
so the portal network maybe i'll explain

2708
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
so the portal network maybe i'll explain
 

2709
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,069
so the portal network maybe i'll explain
that quickly

2710
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
that quickly
 

2711
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,750
that quickly
it's like a selector thing it disables

2712
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:17,760
it's like a selector thing it disables
 

2713
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,030
it's like a selector thing it disables
all the nether portals

2714
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
all the nether portals
 

2715
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,470
all the nether portals
i have except for one

2716
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
i have except for one
 

2717
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,990
i have except for one
um and uh

2718
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000

 

2719
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,670

it's it's a complicated thing but

2720
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:27,680
it's it's a complicated thing but
 

2721
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,829
it's it's a complicated thing but
there's basically

2722
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
there's basically
 

2723
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,510
there's basically
wires running throughout my nether that

2724
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
wires running throughout my nether that
 

2725
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,670
wires running throughout my nether that
connect all the portals together

2726
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
connect all the portals together
 

2727
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,270
connect all the portals together
and like if i want to go to my zombie

2728
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
and like if i want to go to my zombie
 

2729
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,750
and like if i want to go to my zombie
purifier i need to select 11 delay on

2730
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
purifier i need to select 11 delay on
 

2731
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,030
purifier i need to select 11 delay on
this

2732
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
this
 

2733
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,390
this
so 10 11 hit the button

2734
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400

 

2735
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,309

turns on that portal turns off all the

2736
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:48,319
turns on that portal turns off all the
 

2737
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,510
turns on that portal turns off all the
other ones

2738
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
other ones
 

2739
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,549
other ones
so that when i go

2740
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
so that when i go
 

2741
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,230
so that when i go
um like if i go into this one

2742
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:56,240
um like if i go into this one
 

2743
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,950
um like if i go into this one
hit this when i come out i'm gonna end

2744
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:58,960
hit this when i come out i'm gonna end
 

2745
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,549
hit this when i come out i'm gonna end
up at that one over there

2746
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
up at that one over there
 

2747
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,829
up at that one over there
because this one closes behind me and

2748
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:03,839
because this one closes behind me and
 

2749
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,270
because this one closes behind me and
it's like a way of getting around the

2750
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
it's like a way of getting around the
 

2751
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,109
it's like a way of getting around the
nether a little easier especially if i'm

2752
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:07,119
nether a little easier especially if i'm
 

2753
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,349
nether a little easier especially if i'm
moving mobs around

2754
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
moving mobs around
 

2755
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,910
moving mobs around
but uh this is my stronghold base

2756
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
but uh this is my stronghold base
 

2757
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,990
but uh this is my stronghold base
um this was supposed to be

2758
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
um this was supposed to be
 

2759
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,630
um this was supposed to be
like my main base but it never ended up

2760
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
like my main base but it never ended up
 

2761
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,549
like my main base but it never ended up
turning into that i

2762
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
turning into that i
 

2763
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,630
turning into that i
i treated this area more as like a

2764
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640
i treated this area more as like a
 

2765
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,750
i treated this area more as like a
workshop almost

2766
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
workshop almost
 

2767
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,990
workshop almost
like i i would build things here and

2768
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,000
like i i would build things here and
 

2769
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,270
like i i would build things here and
then i would tear them down and i'd

2770
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280
then i would tear them down and i'd
 

2771
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,870
then i would tear them down and i'd
build them and tear them down and

2772
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
build them and tear them down and
 

2773
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,270
build them and tear them down and
nothing was really too permanent

2774
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
nothing was really too permanent
 

2775
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,589
nothing was really too permanent
the only thing that really has survived

2776
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
the only thing that really has survived
 

2777
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,470
the only thing that really has survived
is

2778
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
is
 

2779
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,510
is
my silverfish farm idea

2780
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
my silverfish farm idea
 

2781
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,789
my silverfish farm idea
which probably doesn't work quite right

2782
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
which probably doesn't work quite right
 

2783
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,150
which probably doesn't work quite right
anymore

2784
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
anymore
 

2785
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,190
anymore
i have a silverfish spawner there you

2786
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
i have a silverfish spawner there you
 

2787
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,630
i have a silverfish spawner there you
can see the end portals

2788
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
can see the end portals
 

2789
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,990
can see the end portals
is kind of uh all around it too by the

2790
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
is kind of uh all around it too by the
 

2791
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,870
is kind of uh all around it too by the
way

2792
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
way
 

2793
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,230
way
here let's let's turn it on

2794
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240

 

2795
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,829

so that makes it dark in there silver

2796
00:55:59,829 --> 00:55:59,839
so that makes it dark in there silver
 

2797
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,750
so that makes it dark in there silver
fish spawn they end up in this water

2798
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
fish spawn they end up in this water
 

2799
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,109
fish spawn they end up in this water
stream

2800
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
stream
 

2801
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,270
stream
they get pushed towards a stone block

2802
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
they get pushed towards a stone block
 

2803
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,910
they get pushed towards a stone block
here and i had this idea

2804
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
here and i had this idea
 

2805
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,030
here and i had this idea
of making like a stone generator

2806
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
of making like a stone generator
 

2807
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,470
of making like a stone generator
and it will automatically push

2808
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
and it will automatically push
 

2809
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,549
and it will automatically push
a new stone block to that area then when

2810
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
a new stone block to that area then when
 

2811
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,349
a new stone block to that area then when
the silverfish enters it

2812
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
the silverfish enters it
 

2813
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,510
the silverfish enters it
a bud switch detects that and causes

2814
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:23,520
a bud switch detects that and causes
 

2815
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,230
a bud switch detects that and causes
the chain to push forward and a new

2816
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
the chain to push forward and a new
 

2817
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,870
the chain to push forward and a new
stone block gets created and then

2818
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:28,880
stone block gets created and then
 

2819
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,230
stone block gets created and then
this stuff gets piled into a giant

2820
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
this stuff gets piled into a giant
 

2821
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,270
this stuff gets piled into a giant
cube of silverfish blocks

2822
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
cube of silverfish blocks
 

2823
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,710
cube of silverfish blocks
and yeah it was a

2824
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
and yeah it was a
 

2825
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,470

it was more for the fun of it i was
going to try to take these guys and use

2828
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
going to try to take these guys and use
 

2829
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,069
going to try to take these guys and use
them for mining

2830
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
them for mining
 

2831
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,670
them for mining
that didn't really turn out too well

2832
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
that didn't really turn out too well
 

2833
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,670
that didn't really turn out too well
although i i still need more of them

2834
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
although i i still need more of them
 

2835
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,069
although i i still need more of them
but the silver fish i create will

2836
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
but the silver fish i create will
 

2837
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,670
but the silver fish i create will
does this work

2838
00:56:59,670 --> 00:56:59,680
does this work
 

2839
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,150
does this work
oh yeah that drops them down the

2840
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
oh yeah that drops them down the
 

2841
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,230
oh yeah that drops them down the
silverfish will go into this portal and

2842
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
silverfish will go into this portal and
 

2843
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,150
silverfish will go into this portal and
get transported somewhere using the

2844
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160
get transported somewhere using the
 

2845
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,990
get transported somewhere using the
portal network

2846
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,000
portal network
 

2847
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,030
portal network
um

2848
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040

 

2849
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,390

yeah kind of a strange strange idea

2850
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
yeah kind of a strange strange idea
 

2851
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,829
yeah kind of a strange strange idea
honestly

2852
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
honestly
 

2853
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,069
honestly
oh we gotta go to the end yet too oh my

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,789
it's never gonna end this is another
giant

2860
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
giant
 

2861
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,589
giant
warehouse of blocks we got stored here

2862
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599

 

2863
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,589

let's go on up snow farm thing

2864
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
let's go on up snow farm thing
 

2865
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,950
let's go on up snow farm thing
let's see let's see i guess let's go up

2866
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:36,960
let's see let's see i guess let's go up
 

2867
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,470
let's see let's see i guess let's go up
here

2868
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
here
 

2869
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,230
here
yeah this place is pretty messy still i

2870
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
yeah this place is pretty messy still i
 

2871
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,190
yeah this place is pretty messy still i
should really try to finish it

2872
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
should really try to finish it
 

2873
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,270
should really try to finish it
i think if i i was a better builder back

2874
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
i think if i i was a better builder back
 

2875
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,549
i think if i i was a better builder back
in the day i would have done something

2876
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
in the day i would have done something
 

2877
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:47,670
in the day i would have done something
amazing with this but i

2878
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
amazing with this but i
 

2879
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,549
amazing with this but i
i just struggled so much trying to come

2880
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:50,559
i just struggled so much trying to come
 

2881
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,670
i just struggled so much trying to come
up with a design

2882
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:51,680
up with a design
 

2883
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,430
up with a design
i never did come up with one

2884
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
i never did come up with one
 

2885
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,390
i never did come up with one
but yeah we got a hostile mob system

2886
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,400
but yeah we got a hostile mob system
 

2887
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,870
but yeah we got a hostile mob system
here

2888
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:58,880
here
 

2889
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,589
here
there's a sorting system up there the

2890
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
there's a sorting system up there the
 

2891
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,510
there's a sorting system up there the
idea was to make a bomb factory with

2892
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:03,520
idea was to make a bomb factory with
 

2893
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,309
idea was to make a bomb factory with
this thing

2894
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:04,319
this thing
 

2895
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,670
this thing
and a lot of that doesn't work currently

2896
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:07,680
and a lot of that doesn't work currently
 

2897
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,150
and a lot of that doesn't work currently
but

2898
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,160
but
 

2899
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,030
but
maybe in the future this is going to be

2900
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
maybe in the future this is going to be
 

2901
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,870
maybe in the future this is going to be
a storage room

2902
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:12,880
a storage room
 

2903
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,270
a storage room
but i most likely will tear this down in

2904
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
but i most likely will tear this down in
 

2905
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,150
but i most likely will tear this down in
the future and

2906
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
the future and
 

2907
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,430
the future and
come up with something better if we go

2908
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
come up with something better if we go
 

2909
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,430
come up with something better if we go
up out of here we can check out the mob

2910
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,440
up out of here we can check out the mob
 

2911
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,030
up out of here we can check out the mob
system

2912
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
system
 

2913
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,230
system

2914
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
[Music]
 

2915
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,510

really quickly

2916
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520

 

2917
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,829

not my best throw don't judge me on that

2918
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:34,839

 

2919
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:35,990

one

2920
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
one
 

2921
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,510
one
man yeah we got a lot to check out

2922
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,520
man yeah we got a lot to check out
 

2923
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,829
man yeah we got a lot to check out
this is the giant mob system not very

2924
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:43,839
this is the giant mob system not very
 

2925
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,109
this is the giant mob system not very
efficient

2926
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
efficient
 

2927
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,430
efficient
but back in the day it was pretty good

2928
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440

 

2929
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,190

easy to set up there's a light switch to

2930
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
easy to set up there's a light switch to
 

2931
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,349
easy to set up there's a light switch to
turn it on and off here

2932
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
turn it on and off here
 

2933
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,710
turn it on and off here
oh um

2934
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,720
oh um
 

2935
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,069
oh um
that's where the majority of my

2936
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,079
that's where the majority of my
 

2937
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,670
that's where the majority of my
gunpowders come from actually in the

2938
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
gunpowders come from actually in the
 

2939
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,349
gunpowders come from actually in the
world

2940
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
world
 

2941
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:05,990
world
let's see i guess we'll go this way

2942
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,000
let's see i guess we'll go this way
 

2943
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,230
let's see i guess we'll go this way
out over here is my ice tray let me just

2944
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,240
out over here is my ice tray let me just
 

2945
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,349
out over here is my ice tray let me just
skip this

2946
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:11,359

 

2947
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,190

yeah i almost have this in the middle of

2948
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
yeah i almost have this in the middle of
 

2949
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,670
yeah i almost have this in the middle of
nowhere but this is my ice tray

2950
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680
nowhere but this is my ice tray
 

2951
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,510
nowhere but this is my ice tray
i had this idea to make an ice firm a

2952
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:17,520
i had this idea to make an ice firm a
 

2953
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,670
i had this idea to make an ice firm a
little while ago which is a

2954
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
little while ago which is a
 

2955
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,870
little while ago which is a
pretty well known concept nowadays

2956
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
pretty well known concept nowadays
 

2957
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,230
pretty well known concept nowadays
and in fact there's some pretty cool

2958
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,240
and in fact there's some pretty cool
 

2959
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,990
and in fact there's some pretty cool
designs out there nowadays but

2960
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
designs out there nowadays but
 

2961
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,030
designs out there nowadays but
this one it works pretty good too uh

2962
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:29,040
this one it works pretty good too uh
 

2963
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,150
this one it works pretty good too uh
basically you pull this lever

2964
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
basically you pull this lever
 

2965
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,230
basically you pull this lever
all the snow blocks fall down those are

2966
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
all the snow blocks fall down those are
 

2967
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,750
all the snow blocks fall down those are
just there to make the water freeze

2968
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:35,760
just there to make the water freeze
 

2969
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,630
just there to make the water freeze
quicker because

2970
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
quicker because
 

2971
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,230
quicker because
it freezes quicker if there's an

2972
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
it freezes quicker if there's an
 

2973
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,030
it freezes quicker if there's an
adjacent block next to the water

2974
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
adjacent block next to the water
 

2975
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,910
adjacent block next to the water
compared to this being all solid water

2976
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
compared to this being all solid water
 

2977
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,630
compared to this being all solid water
um

2978
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
um
 

2979
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,910
um
then it freezes you harvest it

2980
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
then it freezes you harvest it
 

2981
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,270
then it freezes you harvest it
you hit this button it spits out the

2982
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
you hit this button it spits out the
 

2983
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,789
you hit this button it spits out the
water and then pulls it back and it

2984
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
water and then pulls it back and it
 

2985
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,630
water and then pulls it back and it
creates like a giant pool and then it

2986
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
creates like a giant pool and then it
 

2987
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,190
creates like a giant pool and then it
freezes

2988
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
freezes
 

2989
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,230
freezes
and you've seen it before

2990
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
and you've seen it before
 

2991
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,109
and you've seen it before

3074
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,440
yeah so you see it took us to this
 

3075
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,109
yeah so you see it took us to this
portal instead of this one

3076
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
portal instead of this one
 

3077
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,710

01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
obviously on a short distance that
 

3079
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,029
obviously on a short distance that
doesn't really mean much but

3080
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,039
doesn't really mean much but
 

3081
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,549
doesn't really mean much but
as the portals get a little further

3082
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
as the portals get a little further
 

3083

as the portals get a little further
apart uh it kind of

3084
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
apart uh it kind of
 

3085
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,630
apart uh it kind of
becomes a cool concept to have the

3086
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
becomes a cool concept to have the
 

3087
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,150
becomes a cool concept to have the
portal network

3088
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
portal network
 

3089
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,589

3321
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,029
up and then it's set up so that when you
hit the crusher it cuts off the lava

3322
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
hit the crusher it cuts off the lava
 

3323
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,390
hit the crusher it cuts off the lava
in just the right way and it

3324
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
in just the right way and it
 

3325
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,549
in just the right way and it
where are they does this not work

3326
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
where are they does this not work
 

3327
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,510
where are they does this not work
anymore

3328
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:17,520
anymore
 

3329
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,630
anymore
oh i think they're getting stuck now oh

3330
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
oh i think they're getting stuck now oh
 

3331
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,710
oh i think they're getting stuck now oh
no

3332
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720

 

3333
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,069

yeah i don't think they like swimming up

3334
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
yeah i don't think they like swimming up
 

3335
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,029
yeah i don't think they like swimming up
lava anymore

3336
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
lava anymore
 

3337
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,470
lava anymore
huh that must be new i'll have to look

3338
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
huh that must be new i'll have to look
 

3339
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,150
huh that must be new i'll have to look
into that later i guess

3340
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
into that later i guess
 

3341
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,109
into that later i guess
um this is also one of the first times i

3342
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
um this is also one of the first times i
 

3343
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,470
um this is also one of the first times i
used this

3344
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480

 

3345
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,870

timing system this is like an extended

3346
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:42,880
timing system this is like an extended
 

3347
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,630
timing system this is like an extended
delay system

3348
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
delay system
 

3349
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,870
delay system
but it's uh it's double effective

3350
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:48,880
but it's uh it's double effective
 

3351
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,029
but it's uh it's double effective
i don't know how to explain it like uh

3352
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:53,039

 

3353
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,829

it makes a repeater last twice as long

3354
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:55,839
it makes a repeater last twice as long
 

3355
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,069
it makes a repeater last twice as long
like eight ticks instead of four

3356
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
like eight ticks instead of four
 

3357
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,910
like eight ticks instead of four
um the way it's set up so that was

3358
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
um the way it's set up so that was
 

3359
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,349
um the way it's set up so that was
pretty cool

3360
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:01,359
