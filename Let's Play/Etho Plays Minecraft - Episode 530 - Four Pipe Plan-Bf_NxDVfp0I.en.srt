that so we're gonna head down there to
 

119
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,229
that so we're gonna head down there to
the spawning area and we got to set up a

120
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
the spawning area and we got to set up a
 

121
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,000
the spawning area and we got to set up a
bunch of lights that we can turn on and

122
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,010
bunch of lights that we can turn on and
 

123
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,880
bunch of lights that we can turn on and
off to enable spawning or disable it you

124
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:55,890
off to enable spawning or disable it you
 

125
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,630
off to enable spawning or disable it you
know so yeah here we go this is where

126
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
know so yeah here we go this is where
 

127
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
know so yeah here we go this is where
they're coming from we got a bunch of

128
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,290
they're coming from we got a bunch of
 

129
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,070
they're coming from we got a bunch of
spawning space here they fall in the

130
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
spawning space here they fall in the
 

131
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,250
spawning space here they fall in the
water streams and then they get carried

132
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,260
water streams and then they get carried
 

133
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,650
water streams and then they get carried
to a bubble stream in the middle we just

134
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:12,660
to a bubble stream in the middle we just
 

135
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,960
to a bubble stream in the middle we just
got a skeleton just went up there other

136
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:14,970
got a skeleton just went up there other
 

137
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,360
got a skeleton just went up there other
guy went up there so I think the plan

138
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,370
guy went up there so I think the plan
 

139
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,400
guy went up there so I think the plan
here oh yeah and by the way the carpet

140
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,410
here oh yeah and by the way the carpet
 

141
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,880
here oh yeah and by the way the carpet
here is to prevent spiders from spawning

142
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:24,890
here is to prevent spiders from spawning
 

143
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,890
here is to prevent spiders from spawning
the way we got it laid out I got to eat

144
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:27,900
the way we got it laid out I got to eat
 

145
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,710
the way we got it laid out I got to eat
something I'm gonna die down here but

146
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
something I'm gonna die down here but
 

147
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,210
something I'm gonna die down here but
basically I made a whole bunch of

148
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
basically I made a whole bunch of
 

149
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,240
basically I made a whole bunch of
redstone lamps and I'm gonna go here and

150
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,250
redstone lamps and I'm gonna go here and
 

151
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,580
redstone lamps and I'm gonna go here and
try to figure out the ideal spacing for

152
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:40,590
try to figure out the ideal spacing for
 

153
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,590
try to figure out the ideal spacing for
this so like what we have to have a

154
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:42,600
this so like what we have to have a
 

155
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
this so like what we have to have a
light level of eight or higher to stop

156
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:44,610
light level of eight or higher to stop
 

157
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,670
light level of eight or higher to stop
mobs from spawning down here so at this

158
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,680
mobs from spawning down here so at this
 

159
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,180
mobs from spawning down here so at this
block here it needs to be light level 8

160
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,190
block here it needs to be light level 8
 

161
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,840
block here it needs to be light level 8
9 10 11 12 13

162
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:54,850

 

163
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,870

14 and then I guess the lamp would have

164
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:58,880
14 and then I guess the lamp would have
 

165
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,030
14 and then I guess the lamp would have
to go here 15 at the lamp right so

166
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,040
to go here 15 at the lamp right so
 

167
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,070
to go here 15 at the lamp right so
that'll prevent mobs from spawning on

168
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
that'll prevent mobs from spawning on
 

169
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,530
that'll prevent mobs from spawning on
these two platforms and basically I'm

170
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:08,540
these two platforms and basically I'm
 

171
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,510
these two platforms and basically I'm
gonna go through the whole area here try

172
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:10,520
gonna go through the whole area here try
 

173
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,620
gonna go through the whole area here try
to pick out figure out the ideal

174
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:11,630
to pick out figure out the ideal
 

175
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,090
to pick out figure out the ideal
position for all the lamps and then

176
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,100
position for all the lamps and then
 

177
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
position for all the lamps and then
we're gonna run some redstone wire above

178
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,110
we're gonna run some redstone wire above
 

179
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:22,270
we're gonna run some redstone wire above
that we can turn on and off oh I guess

180
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,280
that we can turn on and off oh I guess
 

181
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,070
that we can turn on and off oh I guess
this is gonna be way harder to do than I

182
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
this is gonna be way harder to do than I
 

183
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,690
this is gonna be way harder to do than I
thought the lighting engines pretty

184
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:25,700
thought the lighting engines pretty
 

185
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,680
thought the lighting engines pretty
broken in this version I guess so if we

186
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:29,690
broken in this version I guess so if we
 

187
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,540
broken in this version I guess so if we
look at the light it's like right around

188
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,550
look at the light it's like right around
 

189
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,210
look at the light it's like right around
here where my mouse cursor is client

190
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,220
here where my mouse cursor is client
 

191
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,550
here where my mouse cursor is client
light says light level 11 where I'm

192
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
light says light level 11 where I'm
 

193
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,370
light says light level 11 where I'm
standing we walk over here and it goes

194
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,380
standing we walk over here and it goes
 

195
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,610
standing we walk over here and it goes
all the way down to zero so it's like

196
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:42,620
all the way down to zero so it's like
 

197
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,440
all the way down to zero so it's like
taking a shortcut when figuring out a

198
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,450
taking a shortcut when figuring out a
 

199
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,020
taking a shortcut when figuring out a
lighting needed so it goes down and then

200
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,030
lighting needed so it goes down and then
 

201
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,000
lighting needed so it goes down and then
it sees this block here it's like oh I

202
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,010
it sees this block here it's like oh I
 

203
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,590
it sees this block here it's like oh I
can't light anything that direction so

204
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,600
can't light anything that direction so
 

205
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,260
can't light anything that direction so
it's making like a a line right here

206
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,270
it's making like a a line right here
 

207
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,140
it's making like a a line right here
which is kind of weird because then when

208
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,150
which is kind of weird because then when
 

209
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,070
which is kind of weird because then when
we start turning on other lights like

210
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,080
we start turning on other lights like
 

211
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,240
we start turning on other lights like
you see there's a jump here it goes from

212
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,250
you see there's a jump here it goes from
 

213
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,420
you see there's a jump here it goes from
11 to 7 we shut this one off 6 to 7 then

214
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:07,430
11 to 7 we shut this one off 6 to 7 then
 

215
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,430
11 to 7 we shut this one off 6 to 7 then
I can shut this off oh no that worked

216
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440

 

217
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,380

there is a way where it'll get stuck

218
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,390
there is a way where it'll get stuck
 

219
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,790
there is a way where it'll get stuck
though yeah so all the lights are off

220
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:15,800
though yeah so all the lights are off
 

221
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,860
though yeah so all the lights are off
here right now but it's still lit up

222
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:17,870
here right now but it's still lit up
 

223
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,060
here right now but it's still lit up
until it gets updated until it gets

224
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,070
until it gets updated until it gets
 

225
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,760
until it gets updated until it gets
updated right oh yeah we're gonna have

226
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
updated right oh yeah we're gonna have
 

227
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,510
updated right oh yeah we're gonna have
some trouble with this why is why the

228
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
some trouble with this why is why the
 

229
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,320
some trouble with this why is why the
lights still on usually that fixed

230
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,330
lights still on usually that fixed
 

231
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,909
lights still on usually that fixed
itself whenever I place a block down but

232
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:36,919
itself whenever I place a block down but
 

233
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,500
itself whenever I place a block down but
now it's like permanently stuck on

234
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,510
now it's like permanently stuck on
 

235
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,630
now it's like permanently stuck on
there's no lights on here right is it

236
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:40,640
there's no lights on here right is it
 

237
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,110
there's no lights on here right is it
just thinks it's lit up right now

238
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
just thinks it's lit up right now
 

239
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,070
just thinks it's lit up right now
there's gonna be hard to make an on/off

240
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
there's gonna be hard to make an on/off
 

241
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,590
there's gonna be hard to make an on/off
switch for this

242
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:46,600
switch for this
 

243
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,850
switch for this
what's the block I guess we got to find

244
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:48,860
what's the block I guess we got to find
 

245
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,340
what's the block I guess we got to find
the block maybe where it's at the

246
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,350
the block maybe where it's at the
 

247
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,990
the block maybe where it's at the
lightest and 1112 probably if we update

248
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
lightest and 1112 probably if we update
 

249
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,200
lightest and 1112 probably if we update
here yeah that fixed it weird very weird

250
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,210
here yeah that fixed it weird very weird
 

251
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,610
here yeah that fixed it weird very weird
all right it's very good so we can turn

252
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:03,620
all right it's very good so we can turn
 

253
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,290
all right it's very good so we can turn
all the lights on and off now just with

254
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,300
all the lights on and off now just with
 

255
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,730
all the lights on and off now just with
the flip of a lever we got them all

256
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:06,740
the flip of a lever we got them all
 

257
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,269
the flip of a lever we got them all
connected together

258
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:08,279
connected together
 

259
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,839
connected together
there's about 20 of them in total and I

260
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:11,849
there's about 20 of them in total and I
 

261
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,789
there's about 20 of them in total and I
am still having that issue or sometimes

262
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:13,799
am still having that issue or sometimes
 

263
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,769
am still having that issue or sometimes
the light will get stuck on but I think

264
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:15,779
the light will get stuck on but I think
 

265
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,559
the light will get stuck on but I think
it's actually like kind of like the boat

266
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:18,569
it's actually like kind of like the boat
 

267
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,239
it's actually like kind of like the boat
issue where it's sometimes the client

268
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:20,249
issue where it's sometimes the client
 

269
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:23,719
issue where it's sometimes the client
and server don't line up with what they

270
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:23,729
and server don't line up with what they
 

271
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,369
and server don't line up with what they
they want I think that's happening with

272
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:25,379
they want I think that's happening with
 

273
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,189
they want I think that's happening with
the lighting and I found that like if I

274
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,199
the lighting and I found that like if I
 

275
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,619
the lighting and I found that like if I
reload that chunks it actually fixes it

276
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:30,629
reload that chunks it actually fixes it
 

277
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,739
reload that chunks it actually fixes it
so not too too worried if it does happen

278
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:33,749
so not too too worried if it does happen
 

279
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,739
so not too too worried if it does happen
it seems like it's not gonna get stuck

280
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:36,749
it seems like it's not gonna get stuck
 

281
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:39,469
it seems like it's not gonna get stuck
on so we're gonna cover over all these

282
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:39,479
on so we're gonna cover over all these
 

283
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,459
on so we're gonna cover over all these
wires now one more branch to do here we

284
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:43,469
wires now one more branch to do here we
 

285
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,659
wires now one more branch to do here we
don't have to worry about mob spawning

286
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:44,669
don't have to worry about mob spawning
 

287
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,659
don't have to worry about mob spawning
you know wiring you know and then we

288
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:47,669
you know wiring you know and then we
 

289
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,850
you know wiring you know and then we
just have to run a wire from the surface

290
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
just have to run a wire from the surface
 

291
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,659
just have to run a wire from the surface
like from our mob system control down to

292
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:52,669
like from our mob system control down to
 

293
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,629
like from our mob system control down to
Center parts aha so we got that all done

294
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
Center parts aha so we got that all done
 

295
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,729
Center parts aha so we got that all done
it's pretty cool and now you can see

296
00:06:58,729 --> 00:06:58,739
it's pretty cool and now you can see
 

297
00:06:58,739 --> 00:06:59,869
it's pretty cool and now you can see
we're getting the Drowned zombies

298
00:06:59,869 --> 00:06:59,879
we're getting the Drowned zombies
 

299
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,059
we're getting the Drowned zombies
spawning around us again kind of all

300
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:02,069
spawning around us again kind of all
 

301
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,139
spawning around us again kind of all
over the place so it's not super useful

302
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,149
over the place so it's not super useful
 

303
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,879
over the place so it's not super useful
but it's kind of a cool thing we can do

304
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:07,889
but it's kind of a cool thing we can do
 

305
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,579
but it's kind of a cool thing we can do
if we want them to spawn heyyou we want

306
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:10,589
if we want them to spawn heyyou we want
 

307
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,139
if we want them to spawn heyyou we want
to firm try dance or whatever we have

308
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:12,149
to firm try dance or whatever we have
 

309
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,299
to firm try dance or whatever we have
that option now but most the time we'll

310
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:14,309
that option now but most the time we'll
 

311
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,489
that option now but most the time we'll
probably leave the regular mobs on so we

312
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:16,499
probably leave the regular mobs on so we
 

313
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:19,129
probably leave the regular mobs on so we
just right-click that and then they'll

314
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:19,139
just right-click that and then they'll
 

315
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,669
just right-click that and then they'll
start spawning again but yeah guys we're

316
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:22,679
start spawning again but yeah guys we're
 

317
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,229
start spawning again but yeah guys we're
gonna we're gonna take a moment now just

318
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:24,239
gonna we're gonna take a moment now just
 

319
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,779
gonna we're gonna take a moment now just
a little talkie-talkie here I want to

320
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:26,789
a little talkie-talkie here I want to
 

321
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,449
a little talkie-talkie here I want to
try explain this idea I have for a new

322
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:29,459
try explain this idea I have for a new
 

323
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,850
try explain this idea I have for a new
storage system it's kind of crazy it's

324
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:31,860
storage system it's kind of crazy it's
 

325
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,989
storage system it's kind of crazy it's
kind of like Nexus level stuff here

326
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:34,999
kind of like Nexus level stuff here
 

327
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,850
kind of like Nexus level stuff here
maybe not quite so ambitious but it's

328
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,860
maybe not quite so ambitious but it's
 

329
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,709
maybe not quite so ambitious but it's
it's gonna be ambitious for sure and

330
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:39,719
it's gonna be ambitious for sure and
 

331
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:42,529
it's gonna be ambitious for sure and
pretty complicated so I'm gonna try get

332
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:42,539
pretty complicated so I'm gonna try get
 

333
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,779
pretty complicated so I'm gonna try get
that the key details laid out for you so

334
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:44,789
that the key details laid out for you so
 

335
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,009
that the key details laid out for you so
that hopefully you'll understand what

336
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:46,019
that hopefully you'll understand what
 

337
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,239
that hopefully you'll understand what
we're going what we're trying to do with

338
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,249
we're going what we're trying to do with
 

339
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,679
we're going what we're trying to do with
this underwater base we're building

340
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:48,689
this underwater base we're building
 

341
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,059
this underwater base we're building
because that's where we're gonna install

342
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:50,069
because that's where we're gonna install
 

343
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,600
because that's where we're gonna install
it we're trying to make like a modular

344
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:53,610
it we're trying to make like a modular
 

345
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,600
it we're trying to make like a modular
storage system so that means it can be

346
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,610
storage system so that means it can be
 

347
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,629
storage system so that means it can be
built in smaller pieces not like you

348
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
built in smaller pieces not like you
 

349
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,949
built in smaller pieces not like you
think about the Nexus we had to build

350
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:00,959
think about the Nexus we had to build
 

351
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,359
think about the Nexus we had to build
the whole thing before it would be

352
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:02,369
the whole thing before it would be
 

353
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:03,979
the whole thing before it would be
functional this we'll be able to build

354
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:03,989
functional this we'll be able to build
 

355
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,739
functional this we'll be able to build
in small pieces at a time and as we add

356
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:06,749
in small pieces at a time and as we add
 

357
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,600
in small pieces at a time and as we add
more pieces on to the storage system

358
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,610
more pieces on to the storage system
 

359
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,499
more pieces on to the storage system
it's gonna get better and better

360
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:09,509
it's gonna get better and better
 

361
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,799
it's gonna get better and better
basically and it's no fixed size so it

362
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:12,809
basically and it's no fixed size so it
 

363
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,479
basically and it's no fixed size so it
doesn't have to follow a certain shape

364
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:14,489
doesn't have to follow a certain shape
 

365
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,879
doesn't have to follow a certain shape
like the Nexus we were limited to 250

366
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:16,889
like the Nexus we were limited to 250
 

367
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,269
like the Nexus we were limited to 250
six items max

368
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:18,279
six items max
 

369
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,579
six items max
we weren't able to increase the storage

370
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:20,589
we weren't able to increase the storage
 

371
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:23,009
we weren't able to increase the storage
space at all if we wanted to it was very

372
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:23,019
space at all if we wanted to it was very
 

373
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,069
space at all if we wanted to it was very
fixed while this one will be able to do

374
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,079
fixed while this one will be able to do
 

375
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,689
fixed while this one will be able to do
whatever we want we can even change the

376
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:27,699
whatever we want we can even change the
 

377
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,359
whatever we want we can even change the
shape of the storage and stuff it should

378
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:30,369
shape of the storage and stuff it should
 

379
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,449
shape of the storage and stuff it should
be pretty cool with a couple other goals

380
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:33,459
be pretty cool with a couple other goals
 

381
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,379
be pretty cool with a couple other goals
we're gonna have with it

382
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:34,389
we're gonna have with it
 

383
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,059
we're gonna have with it
Auto item sorting like most storage

384
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,069
Auto item sorting like most storage
 

385
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,909
Auto item sorting like most storage
systems have using item filters we're

386
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:38,919
systems have using item filters we're
 

387
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,469
systems have using item filters we're
gonna have item requesting like the

388
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
gonna have item requesting like the
 

389
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,230
gonna have item requesting like the
Nexus has but the Nexus that uses codes

390
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,240
Nexus has but the Nexus that uses codes
 

391
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,030
Nexus has but the Nexus that uses codes
like a binary code system we're gonna

392
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
like a binary code system we're gonna
 

393
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,379
like a binary code system we're gonna
we're gonna keep it a little bit more

394
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:46,389
we're gonna keep it a little bit more
 

395
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:47,790
we're gonna keep it a little bit more
simple with this one we're just gonna

396
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800
simple with this one we're just gonna
 

397
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,400
simple with this one we're just gonna
have to give it an item and then they'll

398
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,410
have to give it an item and then they'll
 

399
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,730
have to give it an item and then they'll
give us 64 of that item back and we can

400
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:53,740
give us 64 of that item back and we can
 

401
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,259
give us 64 of that item back and we can
do that several times right if we want

402
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:55,269
do that several times right if we want
 

403
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,129
do that several times right if we want
more than a stack of items the downside

404
00:08:59,129 --> 00:08:59,139
more than a stack of items the downside
 

405
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,420
more than a stack of items the downside
is we're gonna have to have that item on

406
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,430
is we're gonna have to have that item on
 

407
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,299
is we're gonna have to have that item on
us to request it but I got some plans to

408
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:03,309
us to request it but I got some plans to
 

409
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,720
us to request it but I got some plans to
deal with that as well um let's see what

410
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:06,730
deal with that as well um let's see what
 

411
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,160
deal with that as well um let's see what
its gonna have a smelting system built

412
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,170
its gonna have a smelting system built
 

413
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,100
its gonna have a smelting system built
in here's a big one this is like this is

414
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,110
in here's a big one this is like this is
 

415
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,540
in here's a big one this is like this is
like what makes it kind of crazy it's

416
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,550
like what makes it kind of crazy it's
 

417
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,639
like what makes it kind of crazy it's
gonna be accessible from the entire base

418
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:14,649
gonna be accessible from the entire base
 

419
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,189
gonna be accessible from the entire base
so anywhere we want in the base to

420
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:17,199
so anywhere we want in the base to
 

421
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:20,639
so anywhere we want in the base to
request an item or or to put items into

422
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:20,649
request an item or or to put items into
 

423
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,699
request an item or or to put items into
storage we'll be able to do it we don't

424
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:23,709
storage we'll be able to do it we don't
 

425
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,170
storage we'll be able to do it we don't
have to like go up to the storage room

426
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,180
have to like go up to the storage room
 

427
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,119
have to like go up to the storage room
to get items we can just be anywhere in

428
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:27,129
to get items we can just be anywhere in
 

429
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,590
to get items we can just be anywhere in
our base and we'll be able to smelt

430
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
our base and we'll be able to smelt
 

431
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,049
our base and we'll be able to smelt
items or get items or put items into

432
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:31,059
items or get items or put items into
 

433
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,509
items or get items or put items into
storage that's gonna be one of the big

434
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
storage that's gonna be one of the big
 

435
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,090
storage that's gonna be one of the big
challenges and it's gonna connect to all

436
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,100
challenges and it's gonna connect to all
 

437
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,610
challenges and it's gonna connect to all
our farms so like if if we got a cactus

438
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:38,620
our farms so like if if we got a cactus
 

439
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,199
our farms so like if if we got a cactus
farm hooked up to the system we'll be

440
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:40,209
farm hooked up to the system we'll be
 

441
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,910
farm hooked up to the system we'll be
able to request cactus from anywhere in

442
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
able to request cactus from anywhere in
 

443
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,290
able to request cactus from anywhere in
our base basically his idea or to put

444
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,300
our base basically his idea or to put
 

445
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,629
our base basically his idea or to put
cactus into a storage at the cactus farm

446
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:48,639
cactus into a storage at the cactus farm
 

447
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,420
cactus into a storage at the cactus farm
yeah so I built a model here to try

448
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,430
yeah so I built a model here to try
 

449
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,139
yeah so I built a model here to try
explain this idea hopefully with this

450
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:55,149
explain this idea hopefully with this
 

451
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:56,790
explain this idea hopefully with this
storage system we're gonna have a four

452
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
storage system we're gonna have a four
 

453
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
storage system we're gonna have a four
pipeline plan for pipelines so basically

454
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,250
pipeline plan for pipelines so basically
 

455
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,240
pipeline plan for pipelines so basically
for water streams like this one of them

456
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,250
for water streams like this one of them
 

457
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,319
for water streams like this one of them
is gonna be for the inputs Auto sorting

458
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:07,329
is gonna be for the inputs Auto sorting
 

459
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:10,019
is gonna be for the inputs Auto sorting
so like we give it items passes by

460
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:10,029
so like we give it items passes by
 

461
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,780
so like we give it items passes by
hoppers item filters and if they go into

462
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:12,790
hoppers item filters and if they go into
 

463
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,569
hoppers item filters and if they go into
the the hoppers and they go into storage

464
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,579
the the hoppers and they go into storage
 

465
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,759
the the hoppers and they go into storage
basically automatically figures out

466
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:17,769
basically automatically figures out
 

467
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,100
basically automatically figures out
where stuff needs to go we're gonna have

468
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,110
where stuff needs to go we're gonna have
 

469
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,189
where stuff needs to go we're gonna have
a request line so that is where we give

470
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:23,199
a request line so that is where we give
 

471
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,920
a request line so that is where we give
it the one item gonna pass by some item

472
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:25,930
it the one item gonna pass by some item
 

473
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,799
it the one item gonna pass by some item
filters again if it gets picked up by

474
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:28,809
filters again if it gets picked up by
 

475
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:30,720
filters again if it gets picked up by
one of them then it's gonna give us 64

476
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:30,730
one of them then it's gonna give us 64
 

477
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,320
one of them then it's gonna give us 64
of that item

478
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,330
of that item
 

479
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,560
of that item
delivered to us through the livery line

480
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:37,570
delivered to us through the livery line
 

481
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,210
delivered to us through the livery line
that's where we get items from and then

482
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,220
that's where we get items from and then
 

483
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,350
that's where we get items from and then
there's also going to be an auto

484
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
there's also going to be an auto
 

485
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,660
there's also going to be an auto
smelting line where we can throw items

486
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,670
smelting line where we can throw items
 

487
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,840
smelting line where we can throw items
in it'll go to a furnace array and then

488
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:46,850
in it'll go to a furnace array and then
 

489
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,510
in it'll go to a furnace array and then
it'll deliver the smelted items to us

490
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:49,520
it'll deliver the smelted items to us
 

491
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,110
it'll deliver the smelted items to us
through the delivery line so over here

492
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
through the delivery line so over here
 

493
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,300
through the delivery line so over here
is a model of how the delivery line is

494
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,310
is a model of how the delivery line is
 

495
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,990
is a model of how the delivery line is
gonna work

496
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
gonna work
 

497
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,960
gonna work
so the key concept is it's gonna operate

498
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:58,970
so the key concept is it's gonna operate
 

499
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,870
so the key concept is it's gonna operate
on a closed loop so the items will just

500
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:01,880
on a closed loop so the items will just
 

501
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,530
on a closed loop so the items will just
keep going around and around and then

502
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:04,540
keep going around and around and then
 

503
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,000
keep going around and around and then
this loop is gonna be running underneath

504
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,010
this loop is gonna be running underneath
 

505
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,330
this loop is gonna be running underneath
our base over a large area and we're

506
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,340
our base over a large area and we're
 

507
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,160
our base over a large area and we're
gonna be able to connect up to this loop

508
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,170
gonna be able to connect up to this loop
 

509
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,220
gonna be able to connect up to this loop
at different areas of our base through

510
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,230
at different areas of our base through
 

511
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,940
at different areas of our base through
these ports so basically if we remove

512
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:18,950
these ports so basically if we remove
 

513
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,560
these ports so basically if we remove
this block here then those items are

514
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,570
this block here then those items are
 

515
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,930
this block here then those items are
free to fall down and they would get

516
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:22,940
free to fall down and they would get
 

517
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,870
free to fall down and they would get
delivered to us at this location right

518
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:25,880
delivered to us at this location right
 

519
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,620
delivered to us at this location right
now we're gonna be able to connect we're

520
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,630
now we're gonna be able to connect we're
 

521
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,270
now we're gonna be able to connect we're
gonna be connecting lots of ports up to

522
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,280
gonna be connecting lots of ports up to
 

523
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,480
gonna be connecting lots of ports up to
this loop so if we're if we go to a

524
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,490
this loop so if we're if we go to a
 

525
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,420
this loop so if we're if we go to a
different area and we try to get items

526
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,430
different area and we try to get items
 

527
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,190
different area and we try to get items
from here guess what those items are

528
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
from here guess what those items are
 

529
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,750
from here guess what those items are
gonna go to that first port that's still

530
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:40,760
gonna go to that first port that's still
 

531
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,430
gonna go to that first port that's still
open so the key to operating this is we

532
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
open so the key to operating this is we
 

533
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,860
open so the key to operating this is we
have to close all the ports first from

534
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:47,870
have to close all the ports first from
 

535
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,750
have to close all the ports first from
the area where we're trying to connect

536
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
the area where we're trying to connect
 

537
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,860
the area where we're trying to connect
up to so we'll do something like this

538
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:52,870
up to so we'll do something like this
 

539
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,640
up to so we'll do something like this
where

540
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:55,650
where
 

541
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,280
where
like if we press this button it's gonna

542
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,290
like if we press this button it's gonna
 

543
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,530
like if we press this button it's gonna
get stuck into an infinite redstone loop

544
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:00,540
get stuck into an infinite redstone loop
 

545
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,810
get stuck into an infinite redstone loop
we don't want that so what we do is

546
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
we don't want that so what we do is
 

547
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,210
we don't want that so what we do is
we'll have to retract the block

548
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,220
we'll have to retract the block
 

549
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,770
we'll have to retract the block
momentarily then press this that'll

550
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:09,780
momentarily then press this that'll
 

551
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,420
momentarily then press this that'll
reset all the ports so that they're

552
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,430
reset all the ports so that they're
 

553
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,980
reset all the ports so that they're
closed and then this goes back into

554
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:12,990
closed and then this goes back into
 

555
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,720
closed and then this goes back into
place and then we trigger this and that

556
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,730
place and then we trigger this and that
 

557
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,710
place and then we trigger this and that
ensures it goes to where we want so one

558
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:21,720
ensures it goes to where we want so one
 

559
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,600
ensures it goes to where we want so one
of the main rules to the system is we're

560
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:23,610
of the main rules to the system is we're
 

561
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,290
of the main rules to the system is we're
only gonna have one port open at a time

562
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,300
only gonna have one port open at a time
 

563
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,150
only gonna have one port open at a time
also we're not really trying to store

564
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,160
also we're not really trying to store
 

565
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,790
also we're not really trying to store
like every single item like Auto sort

566
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:31,800
like every single item like Auto sort
 

567
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,980
like every single item like Auto sort
every single item it's more like if we

568
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:33,990
every single item it's more like if we
 

569
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,110
every single item it's more like if we
build a cactus farm I want to be able to

570
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,120
build a cactus farm I want to be able to
 

571
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,300
build a cactus farm I want to be able to
hook that up to our storage system and

572
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,310
hook that up to our storage system and
 

573
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,670
hook that up to our storage system and
then we'll be able to store and request

574
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:40,680
then we'll be able to store and request
 

575
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,560
then we'll be able to store and request
cactus from anywhere in our base and as

576
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,570
cactus from anywhere in our base and as
 

577
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,420
cactus from anywhere in our base and as
we add more and more farms up to this

578
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:44,430
we add more and more farms up to this
 

579
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,550
we add more and more farms up to this
thing we'll be able to get more and more

580
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
thing we'll be able to get more and more
 

581
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,100
thing we'll be able to get more and more
stuff and like if it's an item we can't

582
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,110
stuff and like if it's an item we can't
 

583
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,140
stuff and like if it's an item we can't
farm like sand for example we can hook

584
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,150
farm like sand for example we can hook
 

585
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,690
farm like sand for example we can hook
up a storage silo to the system and then

586
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,700
up a storage silo to the system and then
 

587
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,320
up a storage silo to the system and then
requests and from that silo and store it

588
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,330
requests and from that silo and store it
 

589
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,050
requests and from that silo and store it
in the silo also we're not really trying

590
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,060
in the silo also we're not really trying
 

591
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,410
in the silo also we're not really trying
to store items in mass it's more like I

592
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:03,420
to store items in mass it's more like I
 

593
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,940
to store items in mass it's more like I
want to have a bunch of smaller storage

594
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:04,950
want to have a bunch of smaller storage
 

595
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,730
want to have a bunch of smaller storage
rooms with a variety of items that hook

596
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:07,740
rooms with a variety of items that hook
 

597
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,460
rooms with a variety of items that hook
up to these ports and as they run low on

598
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,470
up to these ports and as they run low on
 

599
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,470
up to these ports and as they run low on
items we can just request more from the

600
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
items we can just request more from the
 

601
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,150
items we can just request more from the
system and like if we build a cactus

602
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,160
system and like if we build a cactus
 

603
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,040
system and like if we build a cactus
farm the cactus is gonna be stored at

604
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,050
farm the cactus is gonna be stored at
 

605
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,430
farm the cactus is gonna be stored at
the cactus farm not into storage rooms

606
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
the cactus farm not into storage rooms
 

607
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
the cactus farm not into storage rooms
it's more like we we take them from that

608
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:23,970
it's more like we we take them from that
 

609
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,540
it's more like we we take them from that
cactus farm as we need it but the bulk

610
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:26,550
cactus farm as we need it but the bulk
 

611
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:41,080
cactus farm as we need it but the bulk
of the storage will be in the farms

612
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,090

 

613
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:47,450

[Music]

614
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:47,460

 

615
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,220

so at the end of last episode I spent

616
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,230
so at the end of last episode I spent
 

617
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,140
so at the end of last episode I spent
some time farming wither skulls we got

618
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,150
some time farming wither skulls we got
 

619
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,930
some time farming wither skulls we got
15 of them now to cash in five five more

620
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:54,940
15 of them now to cash in five five more
 

621
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,120
15 of them now to cash in five five more
begins here and I was playing around

622
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,130
begins here and I was playing around
 

623
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,280
begins here and I was playing around
with idea maybe blowing up a wither I

624
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,290
with idea maybe blowing up a wither I
 

625
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,500
with idea maybe blowing up a wither I
thought that would be fun but I couldn't

626
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,510
thought that would be fun but I couldn't
 

627
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,880
thought that would be fun but I couldn't
get it to work there's a like I thought

628
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:05,890
get it to work there's a like I thought
 

629
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,310
get it to work there's a like I thought
if I put enough TNT together it would

630
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
if I put enough TNT together it would
 

631
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,260
if I put enough TNT together it would
kill them all in one shot but like even

632
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,270
kill them all in one shot but like even
 

633
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,310
kill them all in one shot but like even
after one TNT blows up in that frame the

634
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
after one TNT blows up in that frame the
 

635
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
after one TNT blows up in that frame the
damage thicken vulnerability kicks in so

636
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,050
damage thicken vulnerability kicks in so
 

637
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,690
damage thicken vulnerability kicks in so
you can only do so much damage in so

638
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,700
you can only do so much damage in so
 

639
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,740
you can only do so much damage in so
much time so it didn't work I think this

640
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:22,750
much time so it didn't work I think this
 

641
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,640
much time so it didn't work I think this
trick does work Oh actually I'm supposed

642
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:26,650
trick does work Oh actually I'm supposed
 

643
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,820
trick does work Oh actually I'm supposed
to have him that high never done this

644
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:29,830
to have him that high never done this
 

645
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:40,160
to have him that high never done this
before that's loud

646
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,170

 

647
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,360

yeah so he'll kind of get stuck there

648
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,370
yeah so he'll kind of get stuck there
 

649
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,200
yeah so he'll kind of get stuck there
it'll automatically die that way as well

650
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,210
it'll automatically die that way as well
 

651
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,110
it'll automatically die that way as well
from attacking itself

652
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,120

 

653
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,990

not as cool but we got to get these

654
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,000
not as cool but we got to get these
 

655
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,970
not as cool but we got to get these
peakins right so I'm gonna farm up a few

656
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:54,980
peakins right so I'm gonna farm up a few
 

657
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,030
peakins right so I'm gonna farm up a few
withers here damn first wither down

658
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040
withers here damn first wither down
 

659
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:07,060
withers here damn first wither down
he's a cake let's do one more here and

660
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,070
he's a cake let's do one more here and
 

661
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,710
he's a cake let's do one more here and
we'll try get some winter roses with the

662
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
we'll try get some winter roses with the
 

663
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,190
we'll try get some winter roses with the
last one I think okay so I think the way

664
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,200
last one I think okay so I think the way
 

665
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,500
last one I think okay so I think the way
this works though if the wither kills a

666
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:17,510
this works though if the wither kills a
 

667
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,840
this works though if the wither kills a
mob either a hostile mob or a passive

668
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:19,850
mob either a hostile mob or a passive
 

669
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,770
mob either a hostile mob or a passive
one or whatever

670
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:20,780
one or whatever
 

671
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,070
one or whatever
I think they drop a withered rose and

672
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,080
I think they drop a withered rose and
 

673
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
I think they drop a withered rose and
then you got to grab it before it gets

674
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,370
then you got to grab it before it gets
 

675
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,040
then you got to grab it before it gets
blown up because it can get blown up as

676
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,050
blown up because it can get blown up as
 

677
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,560
blown up because it can get blown up as
well so I think we can use snow golems

678
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,570
well so I think we can use snow golems
 

679
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,950
well so I think we can use snow golems
right I'm hoping hopefully they don't

680
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:32,960
right I'm hoping hopefully they don't
 

681
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,650
right I'm hoping hopefully they don't
die in the swamp I think they like in

682
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:35,660
die in the swamp I think they like in
 

683
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,150
die in the swamp I think they like in
some biomes they die I don't think the

684
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,160
some biomes they die I don't think the
 

685
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,630
some biomes they die I don't think the
swamp is one of them no yeah they're

686
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:40,640
swamp is one of them no yeah they're
 

687
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,120
swamp is one of them no yeah they're
fine so we're gonna fill up a cage here

688
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,130
fine so we're gonna fill up a cage here
 

689
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,580
fine so we're gonna fill up a cage here
of snow golems and then spawn the wither

690
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:45,590
of snow golems and then spawn the wither
 

691
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,350
of snow golems and then spawn the wither
in the middle and I think that should do

692
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,360
in the middle and I think that should do
 

693
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,250
in the middle and I think that should do
the trick I think he'll blow out the

694
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,260
the trick I think he'll blow out the
 

695
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,660
the trick I think he'll blow out the
ground and then all the wither roses

696
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:55,670
ground and then all the wither roses
 

697
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,190
ground and then all the wither roses
will fall on us right I'm hoping what's

698
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,200
will fall on us right I'm hoping what's
 

699
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,170
will fall on us right I'm hoping what's

703
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,170
maybe make a wall here uh-huh
I mean I like spawning 64 of them this

704
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,180
I mean I like spawning 64 of them this
 

705
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,550

never really explained the bud switch I
 

945
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,599
never really explained the bud switch I
just showed it with some redstone right

946

all that kind of stuff and like my bud

952
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:26,649
all that kind of stuff and like my bud
 

953
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,369
all that kind of stuff and like my bud
switch isn't the traditional one that we

954
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:29,379
switch isn't the traditional one that we
 

955
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,379
switch isn't the traditional one that we
use today like with the diagnol powering

956
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:31,389
use today like with the diagnol powering
 

957
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:33,779
use today like with the diagnol powering
of a piston and I went up something

958
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:33,789
of a piston and I went up something
 

959
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,489
of a piston and I went up something
updates next surfaced and it causes it

960
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:35,499
updates next surfaced and it causes it
 

961
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:38,039
updates next surfaced and it causes it
to extend my original one was actually a

962
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,049
to extend my original one was actually a
 

963
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:40,709
to extend my original one was actually a
boat switch like this I tried recreating

964
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:40,719
boat switch like this I tried recreating
 

965
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:44,119
boat switch like this I tried recreating
it here and you would update the water

966
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,129
it here and you would update the water
 

967
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,159
it here and you would update the water
that would flow to the boat and the boat

968
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:47,169
that would flow to the boat and the boat
 

969
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,029
that would flow to the boat and the boat
would lift up off of a pressure plates

970
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,039
would lift up off of a pressure plates
 

971
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,560
would lift up off of a pressure plates
that that mechanic doesn't work anymore

972
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:52,570
that that mechanic doesn't work anymore
 

973
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,649
that that mechanic doesn't work anymore
because boats sink in water now but

974
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:54,659
because boats sink in water now but
 

975
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,299
because boats sink in water now but
pretend that gets lifted up pressure

976
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:57,309
pretend that gets lifted up pressure
 

977
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,190
pretend that gets lifted up pressure
plate goes up that causes the Pistons to

978
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
plate goes up that causes the Pistons to
 

979
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,759
plate goes up that causes the Pistons to
extend and cut off the water and then

980
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:02,769
extend and cut off the water and then
 

981
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,349
extend and cut off the water and then
the boat would sink back down onto the

982
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:04,359
the boat would sink back down onto the
 

983
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,229
the boat would sink back down onto the
pressure plate you retract the top

984
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:07,239
pressure plate you retract the top
 

985
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,060
pressure plate you retract the top
piston first then the bottom one so that

986
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,070
piston first then the bottom one so that
 

987
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,589
piston first then the bottom one so that
the water doesn't flow back and then

988
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:10,599
the water doesn't flow back and then
 

989
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,409
the water doesn't flow back and then
it's ready to get updated again so it

990
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:13,419
it's ready to get updated again so it
 

991
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:15,180
it's ready to get updated again so it
resets the bud switch so that's how mine

992
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,190
resets the bud switch so that's how mine
 

993
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,310
resets the bud switch so that's how mine
originally worked and then like a day or

994
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,320
originally worked and then like a day or
 

995
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,139
originally worked and then like a day or
two after I posted mine I remember

00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:19,149
two after I posted mine I remember
 

997
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,839
two after I posted mine I remember
sethbling showed the way of doing it

sethbling showed the way of doing it
 

999
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,570
sethbling showed the way of doing it
with a piston and I think maybe a couple

1000
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:24,580
with a piston and I think maybe a couple
 

1001
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,269

the bud switch video CaptainSparklez saw

1018
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
the bud switch video CaptainSparklez saw
 

1019
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,869
the bud switch video CaptainSparklez saw
it and he also posted about the bud

1020
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:48,879
it and he also posted about the bud
 

1021
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,359
it and he also posted about the bud
switch and gave me credit for it in a

1022
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:51,369
switch and gave me credit for it in a
 

1023
