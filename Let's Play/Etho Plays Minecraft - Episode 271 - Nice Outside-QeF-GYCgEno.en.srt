let's see what do maybe cyan like blue

108
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
let's see what do maybe cyan like blue
 

109
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,470

or blue purple magenta pink red orange

110
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,480
or blue purple magenta pink red orange
 

111
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,949
or blue purple magenta pink red orange
it let's do those next what they all

112
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
it let's do those next what they all
 

113
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,369
it let's do those next what they all
look like side by side here so they're

114
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:00,379
look like side by side here so they're
 

115
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,500
look like side by side here so they're
not as bright as colored wool which is a

116
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:04,510
not as bright as colored wool which is a
 

117
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,550
not as bright as colored wool which is a
good thing I would say it makes them

118
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
good thing I would say it makes them
 

119
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,770
good thing I would say it makes them
different they have a nice smooth look

120
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:08,780
different they have a nice smooth look
 

121
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,240
different they have a nice smooth look
to them and since they're a bit duller

122
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,250
to them and since they're a bit duller
 

123
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,770
to them and since they're a bit duller
they I think they work better for

124

also want to just see what it looks like
 

139
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
also want to just see what it looks like
with other blocks next to it so I'm

140
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,090
with other blocks next to it so I'm
 

141
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,020
with other blocks next to it so I'm
going to try like stone bricks and and

142
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,030
going to try like stone bricks and and
 

143
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,819
going to try like stone bricks and and
these let's just see what these look

144
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:42,829
these let's just see what these look
 

145
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:51,220
these let's just see what these look
like how well they go together because

146
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,230
like how well they go together because
 

147
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,750
like how well they go together because
on the on their own they're fine but you

148
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:52,760
on the on their own they're fine but you
 

149
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,129
on the on their own they're fine but you
got to find stuff that works with them

150
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:54,139
got to find stuff that works with them
 

151
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,520
got to find stuff that works with them
too and see the contrast is pretty sharp

152
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,530
too and see the contrast is pretty sharp
 

153
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,309
too and see the contrast is pretty sharp
between those two types of blocks so I

154
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
between those two types of blocks so I
 

155
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,770
between those two types of blocks so I
don't know if that would work and also

156
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:02,780
don't know if that would work and also
 

157
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,080
don't know if that would work and also
let's check out the coal yeah I like

158

let's check out the coal yeah I like
 

159
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,729
let's check out the coal yeah I like
that a lot more the other one was kind

160
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:09,739
that a lot more the other one was kind
 

161
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,869
that a lot more the other one was kind
of like a blob of color this is more

162
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:13,879
of like a blob of color this is more
 

163
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,050
of like a blob of color this is more
more texture to it I like it more

164
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,060

 

165
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,759

alright check it out so I'm just trying

166
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:21,769
alright check it out so I'm just trying
 

167
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,080
alright check it out so I'm just trying
to get an idea of what it looks like

168
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,090
to get an idea of what it looks like
 

169
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,330
to get an idea of what it looks like
with some of the other block types like

170
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,340
with some of the other block types like
 

171
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,070
with some of the other block types like
the ones that have stairs and half slabs

172
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,080
the ones that have stairs and half slabs
 

173
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,649
the ones that have stairs and half slabs
with them and for some of these colors

174
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:29,659
with them and for some of these colors
 

175
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,760
with them and for some of these colors
I'd say it works but

176
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:30,770
I'd say it works but
 

177
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,480
I'd say it works but
other ones not as well like I don't like

178
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,490
other ones not as well like I don't like
 

179
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,460
other ones not as well like I don't like
the yellow with that pretty much

180
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:36,470
the yellow with that pretty much
 

181
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,640
the yellow with that pretty much
everything up to maybe here doesn't work

182
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:39,650
everything up to maybe here doesn't work
 

183
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,170
everything up to maybe here doesn't work
and then I'd say that kind of looks good

184
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,180
and then I'd say that kind of looks good
 

185
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,659
and then I'd say that kind of looks good
together up to up to about here and then

186
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:46,669
together up to up to about here and then
 

187
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:47,950
together up to up to about here and then
these last three I don't really like

188
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:47,960
these last three I don't really like
 

189
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,749
these last three I don't really like
with it

190
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
with it
 

191
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,939
with it
and I just wanted to see what like what

192
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:51,949
and I just wanted to see what like what
 

193
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,210
and I just wanted to see what like what
a wall would look like this is a

194
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,220
a wall would look like this is a
 

195
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,850
a wall would look like this is a
building scheme I really liked if you

196
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:57,860
building scheme I really liked if you
 

197
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,480
building scheme I really liked if you
saw my UHC platform I did this a lot

198
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,490
saw my UHC platform I did this a lot
 

199
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,159
saw my UHC platform I did this a lot
where I had a dark color at the bottom

200
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:03,169
where I had a dark color at the bottom
 

201
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,680
where I had a dark color at the bottom
in the top but a half slab in front and

202
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,690
in the top but a half slab in front and
 

203
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,460
in the top but a half slab in front and
then a brighter similar color over there

204
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,470
then a brighter similar color over there
 

205
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,839
then a brighter similar color over there
and it looks really good and with these

206
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:10,849
and it looks really good and with these
 

207
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,580
and it looks really good and with these
block types you can do that a lot easier

208
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:12,590
block types you can do that a lot easier
 

209
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,570
block types you can do that a lot easier
and I think that would would make a

210
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,580
and I think that would would make a
 

211
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,200
and I think that would would make a
pretty good wall and since a lot of

212
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,210
pretty good wall and since a lot of
 

213
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,700
pretty good wall and since a lot of
these colors are so similar you can mix

214
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:21,710
these colors are so similar you can mix
 

215
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,240
these colors are so similar you can mix
and match them together pretty easily

216
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,250
and match them together pretty easily
 

217
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,189
and match them together pretty easily
but let's try try a few more things real

218
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
but let's try try a few more things real
 

219
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,700
but let's try try a few more things real
quick here

220
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,710
quick here
 

221
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,420
quick here
I got nether brick here I think it looks

222
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,430
I got nether brick here I think it looks
 

223
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,339
I got nether brick here I think it looks
really good with like everything left of

224
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:33,349
really good with like everything left of
 

225
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,520
really good with like everything left of
here and maybe some of these ones at the

226
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,530
here and maybe some of these ones at the
 

227
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,420
here and maybe some of these ones at the
very rights

228
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,430

 

229
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,830

alright this normal brick here I would

230
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
alright this normal brick here I would
 

231
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,809
alright this normal brick here I would
say it works best with the colors from

232
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:43,819
say it works best with the colors from
 

233
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,870
say it works best with the colors from
maybe for from the right especially

234
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
maybe for from the right especially
 

235
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,260
maybe for from the right especially
these last three and maybe that I could

236
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,270
these last three and maybe that I could
 

237
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,140
these last three and maybe that I could
see it working with all these actually

238
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,150
see it working with all these actually
 

239
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,839
see it working with all these actually
yeah a whole sandstone I definitely like

240
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:01,849
yeah a whole sandstone I definitely like
 

241
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,089
yeah a whole sandstone I definitely like
this the most with I think these five

242
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:04,099
this the most with I think these five
 

243
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,450
this the most with I think these five
colors here maybe even this one um yeah

244
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:09,460
colors here maybe even this one um yeah
 

245
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,740
colors here maybe even this one um yeah
not really so much with everything else

246
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750
not really so much with everything else
 

247
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,559
not really so much with everything else
the cool thing about having all this

248
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:14,569
the cool thing about having all this
 

249
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,059
the cool thing about having all this
variety and block types like them

250
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:16,069
variety and block types like them
 

251
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,769
variety and block types like them
introducing all these colors and stuff

252
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:17,779
introducing all these colors and stuff
 

253
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:24,149
introducing all these colors and stuff
is not that that was pretty lame

254
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:24,159
is not that that was pretty lame
 

255
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,290
is not that that was pretty lame
people's builds they're gonna be a lot

256
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,300
people's builds they're gonna be a lot
 

257
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,140
people's builds they're gonna be a lot
more varied from each other you know

258
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,150
more varied from each other you know
 

259
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,510
more varied from each other you know
like if you have a lemon type limited

260
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
like if you have a lemon type limited
 

261
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,420
like if you have a lemon type limited
number of block types everything kind of

262
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,430
number of block types everything kind of
 

263
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,309
number of block types everything kind of
starts looking the same as each other

264
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
starts looking the same as each other
 

265
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:36,670
starts looking the same as each other
you know

266
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:36,680
you know
 

267
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,089
you know
but with this I think you know stuff

268
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:40,099
but with this I think you know stuff
 

269
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,620
but with this I think you know stuff
people build is going to look a lot more

270
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:41,630
people build is going to look a lot more
 

271
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,749
people build is going to look a lot more
personalized and not something you've

272
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
personalized and not something you've
 

273
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,560
personalized and not something you've
seen

274
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,570
seen
 

275
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:52,090
seen
quite so often before and regular wood I

276
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,100
quite so often before and regular wood I
 

277
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,430
quite so often before and regular wood I
don't know about this I'm not sure the

278
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,440
don't know about this I'm not sure the
 

279
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,870
don't know about this I'm not sure the
textures work together you might have to

280
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:55,880
textures work together you might have to
 

281
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,390
textures work together you might have to
have like some kind of buffer transition

282
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
have like some kind of buffer transition
 

283
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
have like some kind of buffer transition
between the two if you're going to try

284
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:00,890
between the two if you're going to try
 

285
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,140
between the two if you're going to try
to combine them and cobblestone here I

286
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,150
to combine them and cobblestone here I
 

287
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,550
to combine them and cobblestone here I
don't like it all that much to be honest

288
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
don't like it all that much to be honest
 

289
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,100
don't like it all that much to be honest
these three colors the blues and that go

290
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,110
these three colors the blues and that go
 

291
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,710
these three colors the blues and that go
together the best I would say and the

292
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
together the best I would say and the
 

293
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,410
together the best I would say and the
rest is kind of yeah it could work maybe

294
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:17,420
rest is kind of yeah it could work maybe
 

295
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,560
rest is kind of yeah it could work maybe
but not a big fan of course I haven't

296
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,570
but not a big fan of course I haven't
 

297
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,300
but not a big fan of course I haven't
really seen anyone use this stuff yet

298
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,310
really seen anyone use this stuff yet
 

299
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,190
really seen anyone use this stuff yet
I'm sure once I see people using it

300
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm sure once I see people using it
 

301
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,930
I'm sure once I see people using it
it'll give me ideas of how to make it

302
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:25,940
it'll give me ideas of how to make it
 

303
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,570
it'll give me ideas of how to make it
work but yeah quartz I don't really make

304
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,580
work but yeah quartz I don't really make
 

305
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,250
work but yeah quartz I don't really make
quartz around I don't think but I'm sure

306
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,260
quartz around I don't think but I'm sure
 

307
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,780
quartz around I don't think but I'm sure
that would work with all these because

308
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:34,790
that would work with all these because
 

309
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,300
that would work with all these because
it's a clean clean white block in these

310
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,310
it's a clean clean white block in these
 

311
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,250
it's a clean clean white block in these
are like a clean colored box so I think

312
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,260
are like a clean colored box so I think
 

313
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,010
are like a clean colored box so I think
you combine them no problem and there's

314
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,020
you combine them no problem and there's
 

315
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,870
you combine them no problem and there's
other stuff we can test to but I want to

316
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:43,880
other stuff we can test to but I want to
 

317
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
other stuff we can test to but I want to
get the episode going here so that's

318
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,410
get the episode going here so that's
 

319
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,540
get the episode going here so that's

better than sand I think so a long time

410
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
better than sand I think so a long time
 

411
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,620
better than sand I think so a long time
ago I built this thing like really

412
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,630
ago I built this thing like really
 

413
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,040
ago I built this thing like really
really early in the world and thing is I

414
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,050
really early in the world and thing is I
 

415
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,930
really early in the world and thing is I
built it right in the center of our

416
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:01,940
built it right in the center of our
 

417
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,230
built it right in the center of our
River and actually cut it off so what I

418
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,240
River and actually cut it off so what I
 

419
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,100
River and actually cut it off so what I
would like to do because I want I want

420
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,110
would like to do because I want I want
 

421
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,900
would like to do because I want I want
to be able to ride down this river with

422
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:10,910
to be able to ride down this river with
 

423
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,270
to be able to ride down this river with
a boat all the way through and this is a

424
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,280
a boat all the way through and this is a
 

425
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,770
a boat all the way through and this is a
cut-off point right here so let's I

426
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:16,780
cut-off point right here so let's I
 

427
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,610
cut-off point right here so let's I
don't really want to rip these out

428
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:18,620
don't really want to rip these out
 

429
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,290
don't really want to rip these out
either so I think we should just go

430
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,300
either so I think we should just go
 

431
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,540
either so I think we should just go
around it will will make the river go to

432
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:22,550
around it will will make the river go to
 

433
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,180
around it will will make the river go to
the left and to the right and then meet

434
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,190
the left and to the right and then meet
 

435
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,760
the left and to the right and then meet
up so we're going to tear this whole or

436
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:30,770
up so we're going to tear this whole or
 

437
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,210
up so we're going to tear this whole or
check the land out try make it meet back

438
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,220
check the land out try make it meet back
 

439
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,740
check the land out try make it meet back
up with the river here like it's

440
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:35,750
up with the river here like it's
 

441
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:56,350
up with the river here like it's
supposed to

442
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,360

 

443
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,260

try to angle this upwards here that that

444
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,270
try to angle this upwards here that that
 

445
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,330
try to angle this upwards here that that
being a short clip all right I think

446
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,340
being a short clip all right I think
 

447
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,740
being a short clip all right I think
that's wide enough to get through here

448
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:06,750
that's wide enough to get through here
 

449
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,980
that's wide enough to get through here
pretty easily on the boat is we have the

450
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:09,990
pretty easily on the boat is we have the
 

451
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,910
pretty easily on the boat is we have the
sharp cliff kind of so we're gonna just

452
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
sharp cliff kind of so we're gonna just
 

453
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
sharp cliff kind of so we're gonna just
do some sweeping motions here level it

454
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,170
do some sweeping motions here level it
 

455
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,940
do some sweeping motions here level it
level it out try to even out the terrain

456
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:19,950
level it out try to even out the terrain
 

457
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:28,100
level it out try to even out the terrain
height very nice grass will regrow it'll

458
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,110
height very nice grass will regrow it'll
 

459
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,860

look beautiful and I want the water bill
 

461
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,160
look beautiful and I want the water bill
these two deep throughout this too so

462
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,170
these two deep throughout this too so
 

463
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,280
these two deep throughout this too so
get rid of all this okay well I turned

464
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,290
get rid of all this okay well I turned
 

465
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,350
get rid of all this okay well I turned
out pretty good I would say it looks

466
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,360
out pretty good I would say it looks
 

467
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,070
out pretty good I would say it looks
fairly natural nice curve to it um I

468
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,080
fairly natural nice curve to it um I
 

469
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,780
fairly natural nice curve to it um I
I'm going to lower it at least one more

470
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:47,790
I'm going to lower it at least one more
 

471
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm going to lower it at least one more
block sometime and also get rid of this

472
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:49,770
block sometime and also get rid of this
 

473
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,310
block sometime and also get rid of this
tree probably that one too because

474
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
tree probably that one too because
 

475
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,740
tree probably that one too because
floating trees don't make much sense

476
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:54,750
floating trees don't make much sense
 

477
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,760
floating trees don't make much sense
do they even though they look nice cool

478

do they even though they look nice cool
 

479
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,340
do they even though they look nice cool
and yeah I was going to put another

480
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,350
and yeah I was going to put another
 

481
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,320
and yeah I was going to put another
River that wraps around that side I

482
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,330
River that wraps around that side I
 

483
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,140
River that wraps around that side I
might just skip that just leave it like

484
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,150
might just skip that just leave it like
 

485
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,180
might just skip that just leave it like
this because this looks ok maybe get rid

486
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,190
this because this looks ok maybe get rid
 

487
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,610
this because this looks ok maybe get rid
of some of the square shape I got going

488
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:10,620
of some of the square shape I got going
 

489
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,700
of some of the square shape I got going
on I think there is a pretty square

490
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:13,710
on I think there is a pretty square
 

491
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:20,200
on I think there is a pretty square
looking thing on this side too over here

492
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,210
looking thing on this side too over here
 

493
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,120
looking thing on this side too over here
might I might get rid of some of this

494
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,130
might I might get rid of some of this
 

495
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:30,670
might I might get rid of some of this
water too um okay well next next project

496
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:30,680
water too um okay well next next project
 

497
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,730
water too um okay well next next project
let's go for the bridge just will maybe

498
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:34,740
let's go for the bridge just will maybe
 

499
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,280
let's go for the bridge just will maybe
try lay it out real quick here so we

500
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,290
try lay it out real quick here so we
 

501
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,360
try lay it out real quick here so we
come up our stairs here where is that

502
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,370
come up our stairs here where is that
 

503
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,240
come up our stairs here where is that
over here these are this is the main

504
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,250
over here these are this is the main
 

505
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,270
over here these are this is the main
entrance to our man cave so when we come

506
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,280
entrance to our man cave so when we come
 

507
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,870
entrance to our man cave so when we come
up I think we should have like almost I

508
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:53,880
up I think we should have like almost I
 

509
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,100
up I think we should have like almost I
don't know if we should do a diagonal

510
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,110
don't know if we should do a diagonal
 

511
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,000
don't know if we should do a diagonal
bridge like

512
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,010
bridge like
 

513
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,700
bridge like
here too there or if we should make a

514
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:58,710
here too there or if we should make a
 

515
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,220
here too there or if we should make a
path that comes out like up to here and

516
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,230
path that comes out like up to here and
 

517
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,900
path that comes out like up to here and
then go straight

518
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:04,910

 

519
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,500

obviously straight baths are easier to

520
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:09,510
obviously straight baths are easier to
 

521
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,630
obviously straight baths are easier to
work out let's just I think we should

522
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:11,640
work out let's just I think we should
 

523
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,650
work out let's just I think we should
just take this up take it straight and

524
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:17,660

 

525
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,770

do you want to do let's do half slabs

526
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:20,780
do you want to do let's do half slabs
 

527
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,160
do you want to do let's do half slabs
well man on I didn't bring an axe with

528
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,170
well man on I didn't bring an axe with
 

529
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,750
well man on I didn't bring an axe with
me that was a mistake okay well if it's

530
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
me that was a mistake okay well if it's
 

531
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,850
me that was a mistake okay well if it's
if it's on the ground let's use a full

532
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:31,860
if it's on the ground let's use a full
 

533
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,650
if it's on the ground let's use a full
block like this it'll come up to here

534
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:39,660
block like this it'll come up to here
 

535
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,520
block like this it'll come up to here
now we should start using half slabs

536
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,530
now we should start using half slabs
 

537
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,790
now we should start using half slabs
maybe well what am i doing oh you know

538
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
maybe well what am i doing oh you know
 

539
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,490
maybe well what am i doing oh you know
what I want to do I want to use half

540
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,500
what I want to do I want to use half
 

541
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,410
what I want to do I want to use half
slabs but start it from here so take out

542
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:54,420
slabs but start it from here so take out
 

543
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,710
slabs but start it from here so take out
the stair make this a half slab instead

544
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
the stair make this a half slab instead
 

545
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,190
the stair make this a half slab instead
like that I'm gonna get an axe here's

546
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,200
like that I'm gonna get an axe here's
 

547
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,800
like that I'm gonna get an axe here's
the path I laid out for it so I wanted

548
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:06,810
the path I laid out for it so I wanted
 

549
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,260
the path I laid out for it so I wanted
to go straight then go take a left turn

550
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,270
to go straight then go take a left turn
 

551
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,540
to go straight then go take a left turn
go over the water and then have some

552
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:11,550
go over the water and then have some
 

553
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,630
go over the water and then have some
stairs that come down to the land here

554
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:13,640
stairs that come down to the land here
 

555
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,700
stairs that come down to the land here
the way this is set up it's two blocks

556
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:16,710
the way this is set up it's two blocks
 

557
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,920
the way this is set up it's two blocks
above the water so we could write a boat

558
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:18,930
above the water so we could write a boat
 

559
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,780
above the water so we could write a boat
under here without hitting our head on

560
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:20,790
under here without hitting our head on
 

561
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,690
under here without hitting our head on
anything I think which is always nice

562
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:23,700
anything I think which is always nice
 

563
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,080
anything I think which is always nice
and now our challenge is to make it look

564
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,090
and now our challenge is to make it look
 

565
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,980
and now our challenge is to make it look
decent and not like some floaty platform

566
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:30,990
decent and not like some floaty platform
 

567
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,660
decent and not like some floaty platform
that looks out of place so we we may

568
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:35,670
that looks out of place so we we may
 

569
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,070
that looks out of place so we we may
move these half slabs up to this level

570
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,080
move these half slabs up to this level
 

571
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,780
move these half slabs up to this level
I'm not sure I want to try run oakwood

572
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:44,790
I'm not sure I want to try run oakwood
 

573
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,570
I'm not sure I want to try run oakwood
along here all the way across and put

574
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:50,580
along here all the way across and put
 

575
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,110
along here all the way across and put
fences on top of this I'm not sure how

576
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,120
fences on top of this I'm not sure how
 

577
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,629
fences on top of this I'm not sure how
that will work here

578
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639

 

579
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,069

might be a cool way of doing it bridge

580
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079

 

581
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,619

fence is going across I should have been

582
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:07,629
fence is going across I should have been
 

583
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,509
fence is going across I should have been
doing on the other side because that's

584
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
doing on the other side because that's
 

585
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,840
doing on the other side because that's
when we're going to look at here okay

586
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:11,850
when we're going to look at here okay
 

587
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,970
when we're going to look at here okay
let's do that

588
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:16,980

 

589
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,329

and like the reason I'm I'm sort of

590
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:21,339
and like the reason I'm I'm sort of
 

591
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,610
and like the reason I'm I'm sort of
doing this stuff now is with the horses

592
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:23,620
doing this stuff now is with the horses
 

593
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,970
doing this stuff now is with the horses
and all that I want a way I want path

594
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:26,980
and all that I want a way I want path
 

595
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,769
and all that I want a way I want path
set up for them I always want to make

596
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:28,779
set up for them I always want to make
 

597
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,129
set up for them I always want to make
sure anything I build from now on that

598
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:32,139
sure anything I build from now on that
 

599
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,090
sure anything I build from now on that
it's accessible to horses and so getting

600
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,100
it's accessible to horses and so getting
 

601
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
it's accessible to horses and so getting
across water with them is always a

602
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,110
across water with them is always a
 

603
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,170
across water with them is always a
challenge if we have a path that goes

604
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,180
challenge if we have a path that goes
 

605
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:47,809
challenge if we have a path that goes
across like this it will be much easier

606
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:47,819

 

607
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:59,040

okay all right try this out fences see

608
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,050
okay all right try this out fences see
 

609
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,480
okay all right try this out fences see
it's going to be flat on the bottom I'm

610
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,490
it's going to be flat on the bottom I'm
 

611
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,470
it's going to be flat on the bottom I'm
not sure I'm going to like that let's

612
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
not sure I'm going to like that let's
 

613
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,939
not sure I'm going to like that let's
see what it looks like from here right

614
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:05,949
see what it looks like from here right
 

615
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:21,480
see what it looks like from here right
now mmm-hmm take this out run that all

616
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,490
now mmm-hmm take this out run that all
 

617
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,860
now mmm-hmm take this out run that all
the way down

618
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:25,870

 

619
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:32,430

oh no if I like this I might tinker with

620
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,440
oh no if I like this I might tinker with
 

621
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,740
oh no if I like this I might tinker with
it a bit until I find something I like

622
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:36,750

 

623
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,149

you know what it is I just don't like

624
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:39,159
you know what it is I just don't like
 

625
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,700
you know what it is I just don't like
logs when they're sideways like this I

626
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,710
logs when they're sideways like this I
 

627
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,760
logs when they're sideways like this I
think because this looks so much better

628
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:44,770
think because this looks so much better
 

629
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,870
think because this looks so much better
to me for some reason and not just

630
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
to me for some reason and not just
 

631
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,460
to me for some reason and not just
because you know it's got the light top

632
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,470
because you know it's got the light top
 

633
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,029
because you know it's got the light top
but the bark looks weird to me when it's

634
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:54,039
but the bark looks weird to me when it's
 

635
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,500
but the bark looks weird to me when it's
sideways like that looks so much better

636
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,510
sideways like that looks so much better
 

637
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,360
sideways like that looks so much better
vertical so we'll go with that I'm happy

638
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,370
vertical so we'll go with that I'm happy
 

639
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,880

with that and we're going to do the old
 

641
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,100
with that and we're going to do the old
spruce wood trick in water where you

642
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,110
spruce wood trick in water where you
 

643
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,440
spruce wood trick in water where you
basically get rid of all the logs in the

644
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,450
basically get rid of all the logs in the
 

645
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,330
basically get rid of all the logs in the
water replace it with spruce wood makes

646
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,340
water replace it with spruce wood makes
 

647
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,909
water replace it with spruce wood makes
it look a little bit darker like it's

648
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:16,919
it look a little bit darker like it's
 

649
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,889

like it's like it's wet basically all

650
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:22,899
like it's like it's wet basically all
 

651
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:25,380

there is to it I am a little concerned

652
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,390
there is to it I am a little concerned
 

653
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,960
there is to it I am a little concerned
with the setup that it's going to be

654
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:27,970
with the setup that it's going to be
 

655
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,250
with the setup that it's going to be
tough to get the boat through here if I

656
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:29,260
tough to get the boat through here if I
 

657
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,529
tough to get the boat through here if I
have too many of these support things

658
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:31,539
have too many of these support things
 

659
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,560
have too many of these support things
going so try not to get carried away I

660
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,570
going so try not to get carried away I
 

661
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,149
going so try not to get carried away I
think we'll have two more at the other

662
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:36,159
think we'll have two more at the other
 

663
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,760
think we'll have two more at the other
end here maybe like around here would be

664
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,770
end here maybe like around here would be
 

665
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:49,169
end here maybe like around here would be
good let's put right there and on the

666
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:49,179
good let's put right there and on the
 

667
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:55,169
good let's put right there and on the
other side as well here that'd be nice

668
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:55,179
other side as well here that'd be nice
 

669
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,289
other side as well here that'd be nice
to have a bridge here okay and what I

want to do is try connect it up to this
 

673
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,870
want to do is try connect it up to this
to this is the elevator from my base

674
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:03,880
to this is the elevator from my base
 

675
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,029
to this is the elevator from my base
let's go use it just to show you that

676
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:06,039
let's go use it just to show you that
 

677
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,500
let's go use it just to show you that
they have used it on camera in a long

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,510
they have used it on camera in a long
 

679
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,169
they have used it on camera in a long
time um that is right there

680
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:15,179

 

681
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:22,220

Oh easy piston elevator spiral elevator
 

683
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,270
Oh easy piston elevator spiral elevator
takes you to the top here and then you

684
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,280
takes you to the top here and then you
 

685
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,980
takes you to the top here and then you
come out so I would like to connect a

686
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:25,990
come out so I would like to connect a
 

687
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,770
come out so I would like to connect a
walkway from here down to our bridge as

688
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:28,780
walkway from here down to our bridge as
 

689
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,280
walkway from here down to our bridge as
well

690
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,290
well
 

691
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:39,440
well
let's do make it go out a little more

692
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,450

 

693
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,820

yeah it's probably good here so then

694
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:41,830
yeah it's probably good here so then
 

695
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,070
yeah it's probably good here so then
we'll start doing a staircase down see

696
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,080
we'll start doing a staircase down see
 

697
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:59,669
we'll start doing a staircase down see
how this connects a little further okay

698
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
how this connects a little further okay
 

699
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,169
how this connects a little further okay
I just were there already hmm should we

700
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:04,179
I just were there already hmm should we
 

701
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,240
I just were there already hmm should we
do half slab staircase I wonder eyes

702
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,250
do half slab staircase I wonder eyes
 

703
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:16,530
do half slab staircase I wonder eyes
will probably be fine oops go like that

704
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:16,540
will probably be fine oops go like that
 

705
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:23,340
will probably be fine oops go like that
and then half slabs at the bottom that

706
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,350
and then half slabs at the bottom that
 

707
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,690
and then half slabs at the bottom that
will connect through here

708
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:26,700
will connect through here
 

709
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,549
will connect through here

721
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,690
trapdoors and I tried to alternate them
I thought it would look better that way

722
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:51,700
I thought it would look better that way
 

723
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,880
I thought it would look better that way
instead of having like one here one here

724
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:53,890
instead of having like one here one here
 

725
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,880
instead of having like one here one here
one here one here you know yeah they

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,440
staircase from here the only thing I
 

729
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,169
staircase from here the only thing I
should probably change about this is

730
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:04,179
should probably change about this is
 

731
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,280
should probably change about this is
like if I come up my my walkway here I

732
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,290
like if I come up my my walkway here I
 

733
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,440
like if I come up my my walkway here I
might want to go to the right and

734
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,450
might want to go to the right and
 

735
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,900
might want to go to the right and
there's no way no proper way of getting

736
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:12,910
there's no way no proper way of getting
 

737
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,490
there's no way no proper way of getting
off to the right except for doing

738
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:14,500
off to the right except for doing
 

739
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,460
off to the right except for doing
something like this so probably do a few

740
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,470
something like this so probably do a few
 

741
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,919
something like this so probably do a few
tweaks with it but it turned out pretty

742
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:22,929
tweaks with it but it turned out pretty
 

743
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,060
tweaks with it but it turned out pretty
good

744
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,070
