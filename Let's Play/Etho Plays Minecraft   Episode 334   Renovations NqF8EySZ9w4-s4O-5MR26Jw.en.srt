00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,230
i tried to stagger them so we got them
on like three levels and they're

506
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
on like three levels and they're
 

507
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,750
on like three levels and they're
sort of offset from each other it's like

508
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
sort of offset from each other it's like
 

509
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,470
sort of offset from each other it's like
you know and uh kind of fixed up the

510
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
you know and uh kind of fixed up the
 

511
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,990
you know and uh kind of fixed up the
ceiling here i had a bunch of i think

512
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
ceiling here i had a bunch of i think
 

513
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,150
ceiling here i had a bunch of i think
redstone wiring showing

514
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
redstone wiring showing
 

515
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,389
redstone wiring showing
that's all covered up still need to make

516
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
that's all covered up still need to make
 

517
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,230
that's all covered up still need to make
a few changes here but

518
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
a few changes here but
 

519
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,470
a few changes here but
overall it's it's pretty good we did

520
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
overall it's it's pretty good we did
 

521
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,509
overall it's it's pretty good we did

522
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
this waterfall
 

523
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,870
this waterfall
thing was that last episode i think it

524
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
thing was that last episode i think it
 

525
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,829
thing was that last episode i think it
was

526
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
was
 

527

it so
 

531
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,910
it so
i've got a wheat there got this like

532
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
i've got a wheat there got this like
 

533
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,870
i've got a wheat there got this like

534
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
archway
 

535
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,750
archway
these glowstone lights up here light up

536
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
these glowstone lights up here light up
 

537
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,590
these glowstone lights up here light up
the bulk of this intersection like

538
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
the bulk of this intersection like
 

539
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,990
the bulk of this intersection like
whatever these hidden lights don't get

540
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
whatever these hidden lights don't get
 

541
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,550
whatever these hidden lights don't get
and then if we go down here this is uh

542
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
and then if we go down here this is uh
 

543
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,190
and then if we go down here this is uh
this is the new thing i added

544
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
this is the new thing i added
 

545
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,389
this is the new thing i added
there was a tunnel running through here

546
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
there was a tunnel running through here
 

547
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,150
there was a tunnel running through here
a pretty small tunnel i didn't really

548
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
a pretty small tunnel i didn't really
 

549
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,430
a pretty small tunnel i didn't really
know what to do with it

know what to do with it
i wasn't really expecting to to do much

552
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
i wasn't really expecting to to do much
 

553
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,190
i wasn't really expecting to to do much
because i didn't have a lot of room to

554
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
because i didn't have a lot of room to
 

555
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,790
because i didn't have a lot of room to
work with uh oh

556
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
work with uh oh
 

557
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,949
work with uh oh
that's not a good sign there might be

558
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
that's not a good sign there might be
 

559
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,829
that's not a good sign there might be
some dark spots here

560
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
some dark spots here
 

561
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,509
some dark spots here
uh but i'm actually really happy with

562
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
uh but i'm actually really happy with
 

563
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,949
uh but i'm actually really happy with
how this turned out i think this place

564
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
how this turned out i think this place
 

565
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,590
how this turned out i think this place
looks pretty cool for a tunnel

566
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
looks pretty cool for a tunnel
 

567
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,670
looks pretty cool for a tunnel
and it kind of ends right here and then

568
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
and it kind of ends right here and then
 

569
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,190
and it kind of ends right here and then
we got this nice open spot

570
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
we got this nice open spot
 

571
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,630
we got this nice open spot
i'm hoping to do something cool in um

572
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
i'm hoping to do something cool in um
 

573

a long time might recognize this area i

576
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
a long time might recognize this area i
 

577
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,509
a long time might recognize this area i
used to

578
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
used to
 

579
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,110
used to
come over here just about every episode

580
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
come over here just about every episode
 

581
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,710
come over here just about every episode
in fact

582
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
in fact
 

583
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,430
in fact
and like jump down in this water got the

584
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
and like jump down in this water got the
 

585
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,790
and like jump down in this water got the
old slime farm

586
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800

 

587
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,790

over there and then my nether portal i

588
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
over there and then my nether portal i
 

589
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,990
over there and then my nether portal i
think was over like right here in fact

590
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
think was over like right here in fact
 

591
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,430
think was over like right here in fact
right right in this wall uh

592
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
right right in this wall uh
 

593
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,430
right right in this wall uh
but i'm i'm excited to start building

594
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
but i'm i'm excited to start building
 

595
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,590
but i'm i'm excited to start building
down here because i want to keep

596
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
down here because i want to keep
 

597
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,269
down here because i want to keep
i want to make like a giant lava pool

598
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
i want to make like a giant lava pool
 

599
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,430
i want to make like a giant lava pool
and have like trees around that

600
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
and have like trees around that
 

601
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,190
and have like trees around that
and try to make it dangerous like

602
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
and try to make it dangerous like
 

603
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,150
and try to make it dangerous like
like uh you see how i got a pathway here

604
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
like uh you see how i got a pathway here
 

605
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,750
like uh you see how i got a pathway here
instead of doing something like this i

606
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
instead of doing something like this i
 

607
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,550
instead of doing something like this i
would have like

608
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
would have like
 

609
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,190
would have like
a button i press and then pistons extend

610
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
a button i press and then pistons extend
 

611
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,829
a button i press and then pistons extend
and you can

612
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
and you can
 

613
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,870
and you can
walk up across the lava for

614
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
walk up across the lava for
 

615
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,069
walk up across the lava for
a split second but if you if you take

616
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
a split second but if you if you take
 

617
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,389
a split second but if you if you take
too long i'm going to fall down here

618
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
too long i'm going to fall down here
 

619
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,389
too long i'm going to fall down here
so i i want to make it dangerous down at

620
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
so i i want to make it dangerous down at
 

621
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,069
so i i want to make it dangerous down at
this bottom level

622
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
this bottom level
 

623
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,990
this bottom level
but still try to make it look cool too

624
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000

 

625
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,590

and of course it's not all about looks i

626
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
and of course it's not all about looks i
 

627
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,829
and of course it's not all about looks i
want to like build stuff down here too

628
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
want to like build stuff down here too
 

629
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,190
want to like build stuff down here too
different projects uh let's head on back

630
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
different projects uh let's head on back
 

631
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,550
different projects uh let's head on back
up all right

632
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
up all right
 

633
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,990
up all right
i think this is yeah this is a hidden

634
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
i think this is yeah this is a hidden

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
there's some glowstone somewhere down
 

639
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,710
there's some glowstone somewhere down
there uh i added a door here this is to

640
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
there uh i added a door here this is to
 

641
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,310
there uh i added a door here this is to
the snowball fountain

642
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
the snowball fountain
 

643
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,670

wiring i didn't really have a good way
 

645
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,030
wiring i didn't really have a good way
of getting to this so that's kind of

646
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
of getting to this so that's kind of
 

647
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,870
of getting to this so that's kind of
nice to have

648
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
nice to have
 

649
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,990

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
always fun
 

1003
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,510
always fun
these dark oak saplings i i've shown

1004
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
these dark oak saplings i i've shown
 

1005
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,590
these dark oak saplings i i've shown
this quite a few times as have many

1006
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
this quite a few times as have many
 

1007
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,430
this quite a few times as have many
other people so you probably know about

1008
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
other people so you probably know about
 

1009
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,630
other people so you probably know about
it

1010
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
it
 

1011
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,230
it
but every now and then i still see the

1012
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
but every now and then i still see the
 

1013
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,310
but every now and then i still see the
comments how do you how do you punch the

1014
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
comments how do you how do you punch the
 

1015
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,909
comments how do you how do you punch the
hole through the bedrock so just show it

1016
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
hole through the bedrock so just show it
 

1017
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,669
hole through the bedrock so just show it
really quick here

1018
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
really quick here
 

1019
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,390
really quick here
um assuming i can remember i think it

1020
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
um assuming i can remember i think it
 

1021
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,830
um assuming i can remember i think it
was like this

1022
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
was like this
 

1023
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,230
was like this
yeah there we go so if you grow the tree

1024
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
yeah there we go so if you grow the tree
 

1025
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,950
yeah there we go so if you grow the tree
like that

1026
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
like that
 

1027
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,190
like that
it has a chance of the roots punching a

1028
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
it has a chance of the roots punching a
 

1029
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,510
it has a chance of the roots punching a
hole through the bedrock

1030
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
hole through the bedrock
 

1031
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,390
hole through the bedrock
and looks like we got a hole already

1032
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
and looks like we got a hole already
 

1033
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,750
and looks like we got a hole already
that's pretty good so

1034
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
that's pretty good so
 

1035
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,070
that's pretty good so
i'm gonna spend some time here try to

1036
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
i'm gonna spend some time here try to
 

1037
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,270
i'm gonna spend some time here try to
make a

1038
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
make a
 

1039
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,750
make a
decent size one at most i'm gonna have

1040
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
decent size one at most i'm gonna have
 

1041
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,390
decent size one at most i'm gonna have
four

1042
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
four
 

1043
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,110
four
beacons here so a two by two would be

1044
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
beacons here so a two by two would be
 

1045
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,070
beacons here so a two by two would be
ideal

1046
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
ideal
 

1047
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,110
ideal
but uh i'm not picky

1048
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
but uh i'm not picky
 

1049
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,549
but uh i'm not picky
we'll see what we can get

1050
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559

 

1051
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,789

oh yeah we got our oh

1052
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799

 

1053
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,870

knock it off guy we got a two by two

1054
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
knock it off guy we got a two by two
 

1055
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,630
knock it off guy we got a two by two
beacon uh

1056
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
beacon uh
 

1057
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,909
beacon uh
managed to get a two by two in the

1058
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
managed to get a two by two in the
 

1059
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,990
managed to get a two by two in the
bedrock actually didn't take too long

1060
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
bedrock actually didn't take too long
 

1061
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,549
bedrock actually didn't take too long
either that's pretty cool i had exactly

1062
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
either that's pretty cool i had exactly
 

1063
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,149
either that's pretty cool i had exactly
four beacons

1064
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
four beacons
 

1065
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,789
four beacons
although i can pretty easily get more

1066
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
although i can pretty easily get more
 

1067
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,390
although i can pretty easily get more
the the tough part is getting all the

1068
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
the the tough part is getting all the
 

1069
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,110
the the tough part is getting all the
iron or

1070
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
iron or
 

1071
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,470
iron or
gold blocks and i was a little

1072
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
gold blocks and i was a little
 

1073
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,470
gold blocks and i was a little
short on the gold so i had to dip into

1074
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
short on the gold so i had to dip into
 

1075
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,590
short on the gold so i had to dip into
our iron reserves but

1076
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
our iron reserves but
 

1077
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,870
our iron reserves but
we can reclaim it later uh so this is

1078
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
we can reclaim it later uh so this is
 

1079
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,230
we can reclaim it later uh so this is
cool we got

1080
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
cool we got
 

1081
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,350
cool we got
speed 2 resistance 2

1082
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
speed 2 resistance 2
 

1083
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,390
speed 2 resistance 2
strength 2 regen and

1084
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
strength 2 regen and
 

1085
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,510
strength 2 regen and
jump boost so let's go try it out for a

1086
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
jump boost so let's go try it out for a
 

1087
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,669
jump boost so let's go try it out for a
second shall we

1088
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
second shall we
 

1089
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,390
second shall we
um so with this sword

1090
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
um so with this sword
 

1091
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,310
um so with this sword
sharpness five it's got looting three

1092
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
sharpness five it's got looting three
 

1093
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,909
sharpness five it's got looting three
we can one hits anything

1094
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
we can one hits anything
 

1095
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,190
we can one hits anything
which is pretty crazy because because of

1096
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,200
which is pretty crazy because because of
 

1097
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,909
which is pretty crazy because because of
the strength too

1098
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
the strength too
 

1099
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,510
the strength too
um so this should make

1100
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
um so this should make
 

1101
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,270
um so this should make
oh i don't have a bow let's see if we

1102
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
oh i don't have a bow let's see if we
 

1103
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,710
oh i don't have a bow let's see if we
can get a bow off somebody

1104
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720

 

1105
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,549

should make wither skeleton hunting

1106
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
should make wither skeleton hunting
 

1107
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,430
should make wither skeleton hunting
pretty easy

1108
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
pretty easy
 

1109
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,110
pretty easy
and a few updates ago actually they

1110
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
and a few updates ago actually they
 

1111
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,430
and a few updates ago actually they
changed it so looting swords

1112
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
changed it so looting swords
 

1113
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,870
changed it so looting swords
have a higher chance of of getting rare

1114
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
have a higher chance of of getting rare
 

1115
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,230
have a higher chance of of getting rare
drops too so it's even

1116
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
drops too so it's even
 

1117
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,630
drops too so it's even
easier to get with their skeleton heads

1118
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
easier to get with their skeleton heads
 

1119
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,789
easier to get with their skeleton heads
than it used to be

1120
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
than it used to be
 

1121
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,070
than it used to be
um plus this farm is like crazy fast

1122
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
um plus this farm is like crazy fast
 

1123
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,110
um plus this farm is like crazy fast
at spotting them so that's pretty cool

1124
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
at spotting them so that's pretty cool
 

1125
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,750
at spotting them so that's pretty cool
and the way it's laid out oh i never did

1126
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
and the way it's laid out oh i never did
 

1127
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,190
and the way it's laid out oh i never did
get it

1128
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
get it
 

1129
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,990
get it
should we try ricochet there's a weather

1130
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
should we try ricochet there's a weather
 

1131
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,270
should we try ricochet there's a weather
skeleton up there

1132
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
skeleton up there
 

1133
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,549
skeleton up there
let's go say hi

1134
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559

 

1135
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,390

hey yeah the way i got this laid out

1136
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
hey yeah the way i got this laid out
 

1137
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,950
hey yeah the way i got this laid out
the the beacon seems to reach everywhere

1138
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
the the beacon seems to reach everywhere
 

1139
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,549
the the beacon seems to reach everywhere
pretty much

1140
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
pretty much
 

1141
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,390
pretty much
like all the way up here

1142
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
like all the way up here
 

1143
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,270
like all the way up here
oh there it is right there

1144
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,280
oh there it is right there
 

1145
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,070
oh there it is right there
[Music]

1146
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
[Music]
 

1147
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,390
[Music]
i guess we gotta kill these guys too

1148
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400

 

1149
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,710

oh yeah this is pretty cool and like

1150
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
oh yeah this is pretty cool and like
 

1151
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,710
oh yeah this is pretty cool and like
the very edge of the beacon is up at

1152
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
the very edge of the beacon is up at
 

1153
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,870
the very edge of the beacon is up at
this path so i can

1154
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
this path so i can
 

1155
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,909
this path so i can
wait where are we i'm a little lost

1156
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
wait where are we i'm a little lost
 

1157
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,270
wait where are we i'm a little lost
is this the right path yeah this is it

1158
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
is this the right path yeah this is it
 

1159
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,950
is this the right path yeah this is it
so the beacon reaches all the way up to

1160
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
so the beacon reaches all the way up to
 

1161
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,909
so the beacon reaches all the way up to
here just oh hey guy

1162
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
here just oh hey guy
 

1163
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,430
here just oh hey guy
this guy teleported into the nether with

1164
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
this guy teleported into the nether with
 

1165
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,909
this guy teleported into the nether with
me and somehow made it all the way over

1166
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
me and somehow made it all the way over
 

1167
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,590
me and somehow made it all the way over

uh counting this one of course so
 

1289
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,630
uh counting this one of course so
i still do have the worlds i've been

i still do have the worlds i've been
 

1291
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,230
i still do have the worlds i've been
considering maybe

1292
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
considering maybe
 

1293
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,310
considering maybe
making an episode on that but i'm not

1294
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
making an episode on that but i'm not
 

1295
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,669
making an episode on that but i'm not
sure because i

1296
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
sure because i
 

1297
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,190
sure because i
i did that once before at least

1298
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
i did that once before at least
 

1299
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,390
i did that once before at least
so i don't know if it would be kind of

1300
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
so i don't know if it would be kind of
 

1301
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,549
so i don't know if it would be kind of
repetitive but it might be neat to check

1302
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
repetitive but it might be neat to check
 

1303
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,269
repetitive but it might be neat to check
