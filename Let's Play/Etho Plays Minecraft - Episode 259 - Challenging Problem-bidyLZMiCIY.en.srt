is a I don't know if I if I'm going to
be able to figure this out this is a big

162
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,720
be able to figure this out this is a big
 

163
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,060
be able to figure this out this is a big
problem is how to do the happiness and

164
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,070
problem is how to do the happiness and
 

165
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,040
problem is how to do the happiness and
the health because there's a lot to this

166
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,050
the health because there's a lot to this
 

167
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,930
the health because there's a lot to this
basically happiness is going to be a

168
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940
basically happiness is going to be a
 

169
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,659
basically happiness is going to be a
reflection of Wilson's hunger level is

170
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:52,669
reflection of Wilson's hunger level is
 

171
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,790
reflection of Wilson's hunger level is
health level and he is

172
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800
health level and he is
 

173
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,270
health level and he is
attention level those three things right

174
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
attention level those three things right
 

175
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,930
attention level those three things right
and I have to do I have to figure out

176
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:02,940
and I have to do I have to figure out
 

177
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,670
and I have to do I have to figure out
how to determine how long to keep the

178
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,680
how to determine how long to keep the
 

179
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,860
how to determine how long to keep the
redstone on and off for and if it's

180
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:06,870
redstone on and off for and if it's
 

181
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,689
redstone on and off for and if it's
adding or subtracting to the stat every

182
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:11,699
adding or subtracting to the stat every
 

183
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,219
adding or subtracting to the stat every
update so words or words it's hard to

184
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:16,229
update so words or words it's hard to
 

185
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:17,480
update so words or words it's hard to
understand what I'm saying I'm going to

186
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,490
understand what I'm saying I'm going to
 

187
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,760
understand what I'm saying I'm going to
try lay it out and explain the problem a

188
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:19,770
try lay it out and explain the problem a
 

189
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,610
try lay it out and explain the problem a
little more clearly okay guys I set up a

190
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,620
little more clearly okay guys I set up a
 

191
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,330
little more clearly okay guys I set up a
prop here to try explain the problem and

192
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:29,340
prop here to try explain the problem and
 

193
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,159
prop here to try explain the problem and
also this is probably going to help me

194
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:31,169
also this is probably going to help me
 

195
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,960
also this is probably going to help me
out because it makes it a lot clearer to

196
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:32,970
out because it makes it a lot clearer to
 

197
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,040
out because it makes it a lot clearer to
see what I want to do so I think it's

198
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,050
see what I want to do so I think it's
 

199
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,129
see what I want to do so I think it's
going to help me - but I've shown this

200
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:40,139
going to help me - but I've shown this
 

201
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,779
going to help me - but I've shown this
before behind Wilson we have all these

202
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:41,789
before behind Wilson we have all these
 

203
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,360
before behind Wilson we have all these
hopper variable things and I control the

204
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,370
hopper variable things and I control the
 

205
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,540
hopper variable things and I control the
flow of items between two hoppers and I

206
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,550
flow of items between two hoppers and I
 

207
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,839
flow of items between two hoppers and I
do that using two wires this isn't this

208
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:50,849
do that using two wires this isn't this
 

209
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,820
do that using two wires this isn't this
isn't set up by the way but I basically

210
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:52,830
isn't set up by the way but I basically
 

211
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,360
isn't set up by the way but I basically
have a subtraction wire if I power that

212
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,370
have a subtraction wire if I power that
 

213
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,860
have a subtraction wire if I power that
it subtracts or or takes items away and

214
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:00,870
it subtracts or or takes items away and
 

215
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,249
it subtracts or or takes items away and
then I have a addition one where if I

216
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:04,259
then I have a addition one where if I
 

217
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,559
then I have a addition one where if I
power it it adds items and depending on

218
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:09,569
power it it adds items and depending on
 

219
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,659
power it it adds items and depending on
what I do I'm doing I power the wires

220
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:11,669
what I do I'm doing I power the wires
 

221
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,029
what I do I'm doing I power the wires
for different lengths of times longer I

222
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,039
for different lengths of times longer I
 

223
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,180
for different lengths of times longer I
power to the more items that will flow

224
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,190
power to the more items that will flow
 

225
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,189
power to the more items that will flow
okay so that's our happiness stats this

226
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
okay so that's our happiness stats this
 

227
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,830
okay so that's our happiness stats this
thing here will pretend and happiness

228
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
thing here will pretend and happiness
 

229
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,439
thing here will pretend and happiness
equals our health stat plus our hunger

230
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:24,449
equals our health stat plus our hunger
 

231
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,740
equals our health stat plus our hunger
stat plus attention stats based on these

232
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:27,750
stat plus attention stats based on these
 

233
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,980
stat plus attention stats based on these
numbers here which I'm probably going to

234
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:30,990
numbers here which I'm probably going to
 

235
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,059
numbers here which I'm probably going to
use to figure things out so if health is

236
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:34,069
use to figure things out so if health is
 

237
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:41,089
use to figure things out so if health is
at one I want one or if it's at one I

238
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:41,099
at one I want one or if it's at one I
 

239
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,659
at one I want one or if it's at one I
want negative three items in my

240
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:44,669
want negative three items in my
 

241
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,689
want negative three items in my
happiness stats so I want three items to

242
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:47,699
happiness stats so I want three items to
 

243
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,519
happiness stats so I want three items to
go out of the hopper but I have to take

244
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:52,529
go out of the hopper but I have to take
 

245
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,219
go out of the hopper but I have to take
into account all three variables hunger

246
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:55,229
into account all three variables hunger
 

247
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,490
into account all three variables hunger
and attention so with this set up here

248
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
and attention so with this set up here
 

249
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,950
and attention so with this set up here
if this is what Wilson looked like his

250
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
if this is what Wilson looked like his
 

251
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,719
if this is what Wilson looked like his
three stat bars 1/4 for hunger and three

252
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:05,729
three stat bars 1/4 for hunger and three
 

253
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,610
three stat bars 1/4 for hunger and three
for attention I would want

254
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:08,620
for attention I would want
 

255
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,890
for attention I would want
we have to calculate this so you have to

256
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:10,900
we have to calculate this so you have to
 

257
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,240
we have to calculate this so you have to
do negative 3 plus plus 1 that's

258
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,250
do negative 3 plus plus 1 that's
 

259
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,300
do negative 3 plus plus 1 that's
negative 2 and then at 3 I want no

260
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,310
negative 2 and then at 3 I want no
 

261
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,020
negative 2 and then at 3 I want no
change so it would be negative two items

262
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,030
change so it would be negative two items
 

263
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,320
change so it would be negative two items
flow per updates unhappiness um that's

264
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,330
flow per updates unhappiness um that's
 

265
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,960
flow per updates unhappiness um that's
the general idea behind it question is

266
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:30,970
the general idea behind it question is
 

267
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,540
the general idea behind it question is
how do we calculate that how do we make

268
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:33,550
how do we calculate that how do we make
 

269
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,580
how do we calculate that how do we make
these interacts so that the right number

270
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,590
these interacts so that the right number
 

271
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,710
these interacts so that the right number
is found I don't know

272
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:39,720
is found I don't know
 

273
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,030
is found I don't know
so yeah I'm going to think on this for a

274
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
so yeah I'm going to think on this for a
 

275
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,030
so yeah I'm going to think on this for a
bit if you guys have ideas let me know

276
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
bit if you guys have ideas let me know
 

277
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:59,520
bit if you guys have ideas let me know
but hopefully that made sense

278
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,530

 

279
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,900

anyways we're going to give Wilson a

280
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:01,910
anyways we're going to give Wilson a
 

281
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,670
anyways we're going to give Wilson a
rest for today we can't really advance

282
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
rest for today we can't really advance
 

283
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,130
rest for today we can't really advance
any further with that project until I I

284
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,140
any further with that project until I I
 

285
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,090
any further with that project until I I
get this figured out this is a it's a

286
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,100
get this figured out this is a it's a
 

287
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,360
get this figured out this is a it's a
challenge I thought we were done all the

288
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,370
challenge I thought we were done all the
 

289
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,370
challenge I thought we were done all the
tough parts of Wilson but I just say I

290
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:15,380
tough parts of Wilson but I just say I
 

291
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,110
tough parts of Wilson but I just say I
didn't even didn't even think about how

292
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
didn't even didn't even think about how
 

293
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,040
didn't even didn't even think about how
tough that was going to be to figure out

294
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,050
tough that was going to be to figure out
 

295
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,190
tough that was going to be to figure out
anyway

296
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
anyway
 

297
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,810
anyway
over this way I was experimenting with

298
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:24,820
over this way I was experimenting with
 

299
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,120
over this way I was experimenting with
some trees here you know that big flat

300
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,130
some trees here you know that big flat
 

301
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,040
some trees here you know that big flat
brown patch of grass we made the other

302
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,050
brown patch of grass we made the other
 

303
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,030
brown patch of grass we made the other
day when we covered up the hole I was

304
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,040
day when we covered up the hole I was
 

305
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,290
day when we covered up the hole I was
trying to make it look a little better

306
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,300
trying to make it look a little better
 

307
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,630
trying to make it look a little better
so I grew a bunch of tall grass and

308
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:37,640
so I grew a bunch of tall grass and
 

309
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,280
so I grew a bunch of tall grass and
flowers and tried jungle trees I don't

310
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,290
flowers and tried jungle trees I don't
 

311
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,670
flowers and tried jungle trees I don't
know if they're really working though I

312
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
know if they're really working though I
 

313
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,500
know if they're really working though I
wish there was a way to change biomes in

314
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,510
wish there was a way to change biomes in
 

315
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,750
wish there was a way to change biomes in
this game like some corruption or

316
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
this game like some corruption or
 

317
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,030
this game like some corruption or
something you could implant to change a

318
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,040
