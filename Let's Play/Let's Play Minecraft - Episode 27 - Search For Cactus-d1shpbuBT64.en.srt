down in our mob area a lot of people
have been asking me to make it tutorial

152
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,190
have been asking me to make it tutorial
 

153
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,410
have been asking me to make it tutorial
for this and main reason why I have it

154
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,420
for this and main reason why I have it
 

155
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,889
for this and main reason why I have it
is I've had a few issues with it

156
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:57,899

 

157
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,750

namely spiders were clogging up the

158
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
namely spiders were clogging up the
 

159
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,790
namely spiders were clogging up the
system and I finally figured out how to

160
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:05,800
system and I finally figured out how to
 

161
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,470
system and I finally figured out how to
solve that just need one block of slow

162
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
solve that just need one block of slow
 

163
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,810
solve that just need one block of slow
sand because apparently spiders can't

164
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:15,820
sand because apparently spiders can't
 

165
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:27,060
sand because apparently spiders can't
find slow sand well it seems like they

166
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,070
find slow sand well it seems like they
 

167
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,870
find slow sand well it seems like they
can kind of but normally that spider

168
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:33,880
can kind of but normally that spider
 

169
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,930
can kind of but normally that spider
there we've climbed up and gotten stuck

170
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:36,940
there we've climbed up and gotten stuck
 

171
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,840
there we've climbed up and gotten stuck
and then none of the mobs would be able

172
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:39,850
and then none of the mobs would be able
 

173
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:46,620
and then none of the mobs would be able
to get through and I kind of countered

174
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,630
to get through and I kind of countered
 

175
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,060
to get through and I kind of countered
that before by digging a 2x2 hole up in

176
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,070
that before by digging a 2x2 hole up in
 

177
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,550
that before by digging a 2x2 hole up in
the roof to kill the spiders by drowning

178
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:53,560
the roof to kill the spiders by drowning
 

179
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,320
the roof to kill the spiders by drowning
them and that worked too but then you

180
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,330
them and that worked too but then you
 

181
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:11,740
them and that worked too but then you
lose most of spiders

182
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:11,750

 

183
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:19,180

this is a bad idea so yeah one other

184
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,190
this is a bad idea so yeah one other
 

185
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,570
this is a bad idea so yeah one other
thing I'm trying and testing is putting

186
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:25,580
thing I'm trying and testing is putting
 

187
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,980
thing I'm trying and testing is putting
a slow sand around the pads to see if

188
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:29,990
a slow sand around the pads to see if
 

189
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,450
a slow sand around the pads to see if
it'll stop spiders from climbing up so

190
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:34,460
it'll stop spiders from climbing up so
 

191
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,640
it'll stop spiders from climbing up so
far it doesn't work if it's just on the

192
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,650
far it doesn't work if it's just on the
 

193
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,820
far it doesn't work if it's just on the
top block and get any speed both blocks

194
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:41,830
top block and get any speed both blocks
 

195
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,840
top block and get any speed both blocks
on the bottom and the top which is quite

196
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:46,850
on the bottom and the top which is quite
 

197
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,400
on the bottom and the top which is quite
a bit of it because these pads are big

198
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,410
a bit of it because these pads are big
 

199
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,210
a bit of it because these pads are big
it takes a lot of slow sand to do that

200
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,220
it takes a lot of slow sand to do that
 

201
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,010
it takes a lot of slow sand to do that
and I know it's called soul sand but I

202
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,020
and I know it's called soul sand but I
 

203
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:09,480
and I know it's called soul sand but I
hate calling it that so don't correct me

204
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,490

 

205
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,040

but yeah what I want to do with the

206
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,050
but yeah what I want to do with the
 

207
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,630
but yeah what I want to do with the
cactus is some of these pads are pretty

208
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:16,640
cactus is some of these pads are pretty
 

209
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,090
cactus is some of these pads are pretty
far away from our mob evader over here

210
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,100
far away from our mob evader over here
 

211
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,220
far away from our mob evader over here
so if they if it takes some more than

212
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,230
so if they if it takes some more than
 

213
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,540
so if they if it takes some more than
like 30 seconds yet within that elevator

214
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,550
like 30 seconds yet within that elevator
 

215
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,750
like 30 seconds yet within that elevator
range there's a good chance you're going

216
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:34,760
range there's a good chance you're going
 

217
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:42,499
range there's a good chance you're going
to de-spawn

218
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:42,509

 

219
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,269

so one way to prevent that from

220
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
so one way to prevent that from
 

221
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,929
so one way to prevent that from
happening is to damage the mobs and that

222
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:51,939
happening is to damage the mobs and that
 

223
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:54,480
happening is to damage the mobs and that
resets their idle counter down to zero

224
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,490
resets their idle counter down to zero
 

225
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,079
resets their idle counter down to zero
again giving them another 30 seconds or

226
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:58,089
again giving them another 30 seconds or
 

227
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:05,340
again giving them another 30 seconds or
whatever to reach the mob evader so my

228
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,350
whatever to reach the mob evader so my
 

229
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,650
whatever to reach the mob evader so my
idea is to somehow place cactus in these

230
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:10,660
idea is to somehow place cactus in these
 

231
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,369
idea is to somehow place cactus in these
streams so that they're forced to take

232
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:13,379
streams so that they're forced to take
 

233
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,629
streams so that they're forced to take
half a heart damage to hearts every so

234
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
half a heart damage to hearts every so
 

235
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,079
half a heart damage to hearts every so
often and that way all the mobs should

236
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:25,089
often and that way all the mobs should
 

237
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,499
often and that way all the mobs should
be able to reach the mob of a turret

238
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:28,509
be able to reach the mob of a turret
 

239
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,819
be able to reach the mob of a turret
without the spawning so I'm going to

240
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:32,829
without the spawning so I'm going to
 

241
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:34,410
without the spawning so I'm going to
work on figuring out how to do that the

242
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:34,420
work on figuring out how to do that the
 

243
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,790
work on figuring out how to do that the
best way and also determine if using

244
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
best way and also determine if using
 

245
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,269
best way and also determine if using
slow sand is is worthwhile for the pads

246
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
slow sand is is worthwhile for the pads
 

247
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,290
slow sand is is worthwhile for the pads
they keep the spiders in their place

248
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:51,300
they keep the spiders in their place
 

249
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,210
they keep the spiders in their place
and once I figure all that stuff out

250
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:54,220
and once I figure all that stuff out
 

251
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,819
and once I figure all that stuff out
then I'll make a tutorial on the whole

252
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:56,829
then I'll make a tutorial on the whole
 

253
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:03,360
then I'll make a tutorial on the whole
system okay but we're going to end the

254
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,370
system okay but we're going to end the
 

255
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,720
system okay but we're going to end the
episode here and thanks for watching and

256
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:06,730
episode here and thanks for watching and
 

257
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,480
episode here and thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time
