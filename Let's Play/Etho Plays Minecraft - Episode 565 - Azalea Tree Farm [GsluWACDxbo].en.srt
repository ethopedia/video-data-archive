hey everybody it's etho today i had some
 

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,350
hey everybody it's etho today i had some
big plans in mind i was gonna change the

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
big plans in mind i was gonna change the
 

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,549
big plans in mind i was gonna change the
world

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
world
 

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,230
world
quite literally actually i i wanted to

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
quite literally actually i i wanted to
 

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,870
quite literally actually i i wanted to
do some building you see but the problem

12
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
do some building you see but the problem
 

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,070
do some building you see but the problem
is

14
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
is
 

15
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,990
is
i quickly realized i did not have the

16
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
i quickly realized i did not have the
 

17
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,830
i quickly realized i did not have the
materials to do the building i wanted to

18
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
materials to do the building i wanted to
 

19
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,790
materials to do the building i wanted to
do

20
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
do
 

21
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,750
do
so

22
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
so
 

23
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,910
so
what did i do while i ran off to go get

24
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
what did i do while i ran off to go get
 

25
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,230
what did i do while i ran off to go get
them so yeah it seems we are pretty low

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
them so yeah it seems we are pretty low
 

27
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,310
them so yeah it seems we are pretty low
on oakwood in our world at the moment or

28
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
on oakwood in our world at the moment or
 

29
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,310
on oakwood in our world at the moment or
else possibly i just misplaced it

30
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
else possibly i just misplaced it
 

31
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,069
else possibly i just misplaced it
somewhere and i can't find it i do that

32
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
somewhere and i can't find it i do that
 

33
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,830
somewhere and i can't find it i do that
a lot as well

34
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
a lot as well
 

35
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,549
a lot as well
uh but i also needed to get some azalea

36
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
uh but i also needed to get some azalea
 

37
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,110
uh but i also needed to get some azalea
leaves so i started growing some azalea

38
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
leaves so i started growing some azalea
 

39
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,750
leaves so i started growing some azalea
trees and chopping them down and then

40
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
trees and chopping them down and then
 

41
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,990
trees and chopping them down and then
oh it kind of hit me like

42
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
oh it kind of hit me like
 

43
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,270
oh it kind of hit me like
if people knew

44
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
if people knew
 

45
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,869
if people knew
if people knew they would call me out on

46
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
if people knew they would call me out on
 

47
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,590
if people knew they would call me out on
this they i i mean i'm being a sucker

48
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
this they i i mean i'm being a sucker
 

49
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,310
this they i i mean i'm being a sucker
here right um so i i started panic a

50
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
here right um so i i started panic a
 

51
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,069
here right um so i i started panic a
little bit after growing a few trees

52
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
little bit after growing a few trees
 

53
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,430
little bit after growing a few trees
it's like okay we got to make an

54
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
it's like okay we got to make an
 

55
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,670
it's like okay we got to make an
automatic farm and actually let's just

56
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
automatic farm and actually let's just
 

57
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,830
automatic farm and actually let's just
do a quick little crash course on azalea

58
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
do a quick little crash course on azalea
 

59
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,670
do a quick little crash course on azalea
trees here so we can get more familiar

60
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
trees here so we can get more familiar
 

61
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,710
trees here so we can get more familiar
with their

62
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
with their
 

63
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,910
with their
basic uh game mechanics okay so as most

64
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
basic uh game mechanics okay so as most
 

65
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,750
basic uh game mechanics okay so as most
of you probably know you can bone meal

66
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
of you probably know you can bone meal
 

67
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,710
of you probably know you can bone meal
moss and it will convert stone into moss

68
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
moss and it will convert stone into moss
 

69
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,190
moss and it will convert stone into moss
as well and that's also where azalea

70
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
as well and that's also where azalea
 

71
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,350
as well and that's also where azalea
trees come from the saplings

72
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
trees come from the saplings
 

73
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,109
trees come from the saplings
now you'll notice like some of these are

74
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
now you'll notice like some of these are
 

75
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,310
now you'll notice like some of these are
moss carpets some are grass some are the

76
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
moss carpets some are grass some are the
 

77
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,550
moss carpets some are grass some are the
actual azalea plants so i think it's a

78
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
actual azalea plants so i think it's a
 

79
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,550
actual azalea plants so i think it's a
15 chance

80
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
15 chance
 

81
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,109
15 chance
uh when it tries to create some sort of

82
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
uh when it tries to create some sort of
 

83
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,270
uh when it tries to create some sort of
plant it will choose to be either a

84
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
plant it will choose to be either a
 

85
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,270
plant it will choose to be either a
flowering or a non-flowering azalea

86
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
flowering or a non-flowering azalea
 

87
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,550
flowering or a non-flowering azalea
plant okay

88
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
plant okay
 

89
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,550
plant okay
but you'll see not always do you get

90
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
but you'll see not always do you get
 

91
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,310
but you'll see not always do you get
a plant growing sometimes it just stays

92
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
a plant growing sometimes it just stays
 

93
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,830
a plant growing sometimes it just stays
as air when you when you bone meal the

94
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
as air when you when you bone meal the
 

95
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,230
as air when you when you bone meal the
moss right so i think the actual rate

96
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
moss right so i think the actual rate
 

97
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,069
moss right so i think the actual rate
might be of one and nine is the number

98
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
might be of one and nine is the number
 

99
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,510
might be of one and nine is the number
i've heard the cool thing about these

100
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
i've heard the cool thing about these
 

101
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,910
i've heard the cool thing about these
trees is you can take stone from a stone

102
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
trees is you can take stone from a stone
 

103
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,310
trees is you can take stone from a stone
generator made out of thin air basically

104
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
generator made out of thin air basically
 

105
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,990
generator made out of thin air basically
convert the stone into moss and then

106
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
convert the stone into moss and then
 

107
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,310
convert the stone into moss and then
when you grow the azalea tree

108
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
when you grow the azalea tree
 

109
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,389
when you grow the azalea tree
it creates the rooted dirt underneath it

110
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
it creates the rooted dirt underneath it
 

111
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,310
it creates the rooted dirt underneath it
replaces the moss with the rooted dirt

112
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
replaces the moss with the rooted dirt
 

113
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,910
replaces the moss with the rooted dirt
so you're essentially creating rooted

114
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
so you're essentially creating rooted
 

115
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,990
so you're essentially creating rooted
dirt out of out of nothing now the

116
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
dirt out of out of nothing now the
 

117
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,910
dirt out of out of nothing now the
really cool thing about the azalea trees

118
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
really cool thing about the azalea trees
 

119
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,229
really cool thing about the azalea trees
is you can actually fully automate their

120
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
is you can actually fully automate their
 

121
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,869
is you can actually fully automate their
growth and harvest so what you do

122
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
growth and harvest so what you do
 

123
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,110
growth and harvest so what you do
uh bonemeal in this dispenser up here

124
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
uh bonemeal in this dispenser up here
 

125
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,430
uh bonemeal in this dispenser up here
does nothing so you need two dispensers

126
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
does nothing so you need two dispensers
 

127
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,470
does nothing so you need two dispensers
you need one below facing the moss

128
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
you need one below facing the moss
 

129
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,630
you need one below facing the moss
when you hit that one it will grow the

130
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
when you hit that one it will grow the
 

131
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,390
when you hit that one it will grow the
the plants on the top of the moss and

132
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
the plants on the top of the moss and
 

133
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,710
the plants on the top of the moss and
again that 109 chance that

134
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
again that 109 chance that
 

135
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,309
again that 109 chance that
there's going to be azalea plant in

136
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
there's going to be azalea plant in
 

137
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,710
there's going to be azalea plant in
front of this dispenser we got unlucky

138
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
front of this dispenser we got unlucky
 

139
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,309
front of this dispenser we got unlucky
this time we got an air block but if we

140
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
this time we got an air block but if we
 

141
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,750
this time we got an air block but if we
try again

142
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760

 

143
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,910

oh yeah this grass needs to be removed

144
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
oh yeah this grass needs to be removed
 

145
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,910
oh yeah this grass needs to be removed
before it'll try growing again

146
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
before it'll try growing again
 

147
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,110
before it'll try growing again
okay

148
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
okay
 

149
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,790
okay
and the moss needs to be removed there

150
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
and the moss needs to be removed there
 

151
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,509
and the moss needs to be removed there
and

152
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
and
 

153
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,949
and
you know you got to get lucky to get it

154
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
you know you got to get lucky to get it
 

155
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,309
you know you got to get lucky to get it
to show up

156
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
to show up
 

157
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,630
to show up
oh not in the right spot

158
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
oh not in the right spot
 

159
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,949
oh not in the right spot
hey look let's just plant one there yeah

160
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
hey look let's just plant one there yeah
 

161
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,030
hey look let's just plant one there yeah
so what a nine chance it'll appear there

162
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
so what a nine chance it'll appear there
 

163
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,710
so what a nine chance it'll appear there
all right and then

164
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
all right and then
 

165
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,070
all right and then
you can hit that with the bone meal and

166
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
you can hit that with the bone meal and
 

167
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,589
you can hit that with the bone meal and
it'll grow the tree another important

168
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
it'll grow the tree another important
 

169
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,509
it'll grow the tree another important
detail about the azalea trees is they

170
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
detail about the azalea trees is they
 

171
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,430
detail about the azalea trees is they
seem to be very easy to grow like if you

172
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
seem to be very easy to grow like if you
 

173
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,350
seem to be very easy to grow like if you
compare them to oak saplings which were

174
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
compare them to oak saplings which were
 

175
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,350
compare them to oak saplings which were
like traditionally the easiest tree to

176
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
like traditionally the easiest tree to
 

177
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,710
like traditionally the easiest tree to
grow in the game one two three

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
things about these saplings is they
 

199
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,070
things about these saplings is they
don't grow naturally you have to hit

200
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
don't grow naturally you have to hit
 

201
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,309
don't grow naturally you have to hit
them with bone meal and when they try to

202
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
them with bone meal and when they try to
 

203
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,149
them with bone meal and when they try to
grow they check a three by three area

204
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
grow they check a three by three area
 

205
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,630
grow they check a three by three area
above themselves for any blocks

206
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
above themselves for any blocks
 

207
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,390
above themselves for any blocks
obscuring their growth so if there's

208
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
obscuring their growth so if there's
 

209
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,270
obscuring their growth so if there's
brick

210
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
brick
 

211
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,589
brick
in a three by three area above them

212
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
in a three by three area above them
 

213
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,270
in a three by three area above them
no matter how many times i hit this with

214
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
no matter how many times i hit this with
 

215
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,789
no matter how many times i hit this with
the bone meal it will not grow because

216
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
the bone meal it will not grow because
 

217
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,030
the bone meal it will not grow because
these bricks are in the way

218
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
these bricks are in the way
 

219
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,149
these bricks are in the way
but

220
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
but
 

221
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,229
but
oh yeah and even if there's just one it

222
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
oh yeah and even if there's just one it
 

223
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,070
oh yeah and even if there's just one it
still won't grow because it's within its

224
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
still won't grow because it's within its
 

225
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,550
still won't grow because it's within its
area it's a block higher

226
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
area it's a block higher
 

227
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,429
area it's a block higher
or a few blocks higher it won't grow

228
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
or a few blocks higher it won't grow
 

229
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,830
or a few blocks higher it won't grow
but it ignores any that are on the base

230
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
but it ignores any that are on the base
 

231
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,350
but it ignores any that are on the base
level with the sapling so these ones

232
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
level with the sapling so these ones
 

233
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,550
level with the sapling so these ones
here are fine

234
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
here are fine
 

235
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,149
here are fine
and they'll be able to grow and the

236
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
and they'll be able to grow and the
 

237
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,630
and they'll be able to grow and the
trees tend to grow crooked and at most

238
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
trees tend to grow crooked and at most
 

239
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,470
trees tend to grow crooked and at most
they'll get five blocks tall

240
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
they'll get five blocks tall
 

241
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,990
they'll get five blocks tall
all right very good so now we know how

242
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
all right very good so now we know how
 

243
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,309
all right very good so now we know how
they work let's actually get to making a

244
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
they work let's actually get to making a
 

245
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,630
they work let's actually get to making a
farm for them right well not quite just

246
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
farm for them right well not quite just
 

247
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,229
farm for them right well not quite just
yet you see the plan is we want to

248
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
yet you see the plan is we want to
 

249
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,350
yet you see the plan is we want to
develop this area this cavern

250
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
develop this area this cavern
 

251
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,150
develop this area this cavern
and it's a death trap okay so what i

252
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
and it's a death trap okay so what i
 

253
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,069
and it's a death trap okay so what i
need to do actually

254
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
need to do actually
 

255
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,629
need to do actually
is like survive

256
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
is like survive
 

257
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,469
is like survive
and torch it up for just for now like we

258
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
and torch it up for just for now like we
 

259
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,990
and torch it up for just for now like we
might get rid of these torches later if

260
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
might get rid of these torches later if
 

261
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,790
might get rid of these torches later if
they're not very atmospheric but in

262
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
they're not very atmospheric but in
 

263
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,710
they're not very atmospheric but in
order to actually work down in this area

264
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
order to actually work down in this area
 

265
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,629
order to actually work down in this area
and develop it

266
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
and develop it
 

267
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,270
and develop it
i need to survive somehow

268
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
i need to survive somehow
 

269
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,550

oh man
uh so yeah first step light it up now

272
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
uh so yeah first step light it up now
 

273
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,790
uh so yeah first step light it up now

thankfully with this update
 

275
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,390
thankfully with this update
we don't need as much lighting we don't

276
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
we don't need as much lighting we don't
 

277
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,710
we don't need as much lighting we don't
need to get to light level eight to stop

278
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
need to get to light level eight to stop
 

279
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,230
need to get to light level eight to stop
mobs from spawning we just need light

280
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
mobs from spawning we just need light
 

281
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,230
mobs from spawning we just need light
level one or higher we gotta get more

282
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
level one or higher we gotta get more
 

283
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,070
level one or higher we gotta get more
torches and i'm not really aiming for

284
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
torches and i'm not really aiming for
 

285
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,070
torches and i'm not really aiming for
perfection on the lighting here i just

286
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
perfection on the lighting here i just
 

287
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,469
perfection on the lighting here i just
kind of want it to be tolerable

288
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
kind of want it to be tolerable
 

289
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,990
kind of want it to be tolerable
i can deal with a couple mobs i just

290
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
i can deal with a couple mobs i just
 

291
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,310
i can deal with a couple mobs i just
can't deal with like 50 at a time

292
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
can't deal with like 50 at a time
 

293
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,070
can't deal with like 50 at a time
okay how's that look now that we got it

294
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
okay how's that look now that we got it
 

295
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,990
okay how's that look now that we got it
lit up did it ruin the aesthetics the

296
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
lit up did it ruin the aesthetics the
 

297
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,629
lit up did it ruin the aesthetics the
looks of the place a little bit

298
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
looks of the place a little bit
 

299

if i want to ever go to a new area and

300
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
if i want to ever go to a new area and
 

301
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,510
if i want to ever go to a new area and
develop it what i have learned about

302
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
develop it what i have learned about
 

303
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,029
develop it what i have learned about
myself

304
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
myself
 

305
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,950
myself
is it has to have farms or some reason

306
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
is it has to have farms or some reason
 

307
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,629
is it has to have farms or some reason
of visiting that area because if i never

308
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
of visiting that area because if i never
 

309
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,629
of visiting that area because if i never
see it i never think oh i should do this

310
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
see it i never think oh i should do this
 

311
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,550
see it i never think oh i should do this
and that to it and this and that and it

312
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
and that to it and this and that and it
 

313
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,310
and that to it and this and that and it
never gets developed right so we got to

314
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
never gets developed right so we got to
 

315
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,629
never gets developed right so we got to
put farms down in this area some reason

316
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
put farms down in this area some reason
 

317
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,469
put farms down in this area some reason
to visit this area

318
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
to visit this area
 

319
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,469
to visit this area
uh for example there is a geode here

320
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
uh for example there is a geode here
 

321
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,029
uh for example there is a geode here
there's a geode over there

322
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
there's a geode over there
 

323
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,110
there's a geode over there
and there's even a geode right up there

324
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
and there's even a geode right up there
 

325
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,790
and there's even a geode right up there
there's a triple geode here so i think

326
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
there's a triple geode here so i think
 

327
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,870
there's a triple geode here so i think
we should make this our amethyst uh

328
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
we should make this our amethyst uh
 

329
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
we should make this our amethyst uh
farming area another thing i would like

330
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
farming area another thing i would like
 

331
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,390
farming area another thing i would like
to do with this area is have a river

332
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
to do with this area is have a river
 

333
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,070
to do with this area is have a river
that runs kind of down the middle here

334
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
that runs kind of down the middle here
 

335
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,990
that runs kind of down the middle here
maybe a couple little waterfalls on the

336
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
maybe a couple little waterfalls on the
 

337
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,189
maybe a couple little waterfalls on the
way as well

338
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
way as well
 

339
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,870
way as well
and then we'll split it into two sides

340
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
and then we'll split it into two sides
 

341
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,950
and then we'll split it into two sides
so amethyst farming on that side and

342
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
so amethyst farming on that side and
 

343
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,150
so amethyst farming on that side and
then i think we're gonna put the tree

344
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
then i think we're gonna put the tree
 

345
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,350
then i think we're gonna put the tree
farming

346
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
farming
 

347
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,350
farming
right over here all right so let's get

348
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
right over here all right so let's get
 

349
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,029
right over here all right so let's get
to it here i think the first thing we're

350
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
to it here i think the first thing we're
 

351
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,870
to it here i think the first thing we're
gonna do is just kind of level out the

352
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
gonna do is just kind of level out the
 

353
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,469
gonna do is just kind of level out the
ground a little bit so it's easier to

354
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
ground a little bit so it's easier to
 

355
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,070
ground a little bit so it's easier to
work with and then after we're done

356
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
work with and then after we're done
 

357
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,070
work with and then after we're done
building the farm we can

358
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
building the farm we can
 

359
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,670
building the farm we can
rough it up a bit more in the future you

360
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
rough it up a bit more in the future you
 

361
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,550
rough it up a bit more in the future you
know

362
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
know
 

363
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,710
know
get it looking more natural oh what's

364
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
get it looking more natural oh what's
 

365
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,629
get it looking more natural oh what's
going on but i like never have space

366
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
going on but i like never have space
 

367
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,950
going on but i like never have space
my shoulder boxes are always full it's

368
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
my shoulder boxes are always full it's
 

369
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,469
my shoulder boxes are always full it's
driving me nuts probably because i'm

370
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
driving me nuts probably because i'm
 

371
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,390
driving me nuts probably because i'm
carrying like boats and tropical fish on

372
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
carrying like boats and tropical fish on
 

373
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,189
carrying like boats and tropical fish on
me and a random carrot yeah whatever

374
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
me and a random carrot yeah whatever
 

375
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,189
me and a random carrot yeah whatever
okay it might be my fault a little bit i

376
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
okay it might be my fault a little bit i
 

377
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,469
okay it might be my fault a little bit i
was looking at the vines here i was like

378
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
was looking at the vines here i was like
 

379
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,990
was looking at the vines here i was like
wait a minute how are they that color

380
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
wait a minute how are they that color
 

381
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,430
wait a minute how are they that color
because i think we're underneath the

382
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
because i think we're underneath the
 

383
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,469
because i think we're underneath the
desert right now and i think lush biomes

384
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
desert right now and i think lush biomes
 

385
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,550
desert right now and i think lush biomes
or lush caves

386
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
or lush caves
 

387
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,469
or lush caves
actually has its own biome color to it

388
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
actually has its own biome color to it
 

389
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,629
actually has its own biome color to it
despite like being in a desert up above

390
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
despite like being in a desert up above
 

391
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,550
despite like being in a desert up above
oh snappers all right guys let's build

392
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
oh snappers all right guys let's build
 

393
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,270
oh snappers all right guys let's build
our azalea tree farm and i actually

394
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
our azalea tree farm and i actually
 

395
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,189
our azalea tree farm and i actually
worked this out in creative already i

396
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
worked this out in creative already i
 

397
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,430
worked this out in creative already i
got it uh working pretty good i spent

398
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
got it uh working pretty good i spent
 

399
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,189
got it uh working pretty good i spent
more than the usual amount of time on it

400
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
more than the usual amount of time on it
 

401
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,790
more than the usual amount of time on it
so i figured let's build it together

402
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
so i figured let's build it together
 

403
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,390
so i figured let's build it together
i'll show you how it works

404
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
i'll show you how it works
 

405
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,309
i'll show you how it works
a couple cool things about it as well

406
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
a couple cool things about it as well
 

407
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,749
a couple cool things about it as well
and then you'll be able to build it if

408
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
and then you'll be able to build it if
 

409
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,589
and then you'll be able to build it if
you want to yourself so this is how we

410
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
you want to yourself so this is how we
 

411
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,870
you want to yourself so this is how we
start it

412
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
start it
 

413
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,670
start it
this is a sticky piston right and then

414
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
this is a sticky piston right and then
 

415
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,830
this is a sticky piston right and then
we leave one space for a wood log and

416
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
we leave one space for a wood log and
 

417
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,350
we leave one space for a wood log and
then this is going to represent our

418
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
then this is going to represent our
 

419
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,390
then this is going to represent our
stone line

420
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
stone line
 

421
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,550
stone line
coming from our stone generator and you

422
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
coming from our stone generator and you
 

423
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,230
coming from our stone generator and you
want to get to the point where the

424
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
want to get to the point where the
 

425
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,150
want to get to the point where the
piston can't push anymore

426
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
piston can't push anymore
 

427
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,029
piston can't push anymore
so this is 12 blocks long right and then

428
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
so this is 12 blocks long right and then
 

429
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,550
so this is 12 blocks long right and then
we're going to start setting up our

430
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
we're going to start setting up our
 

431
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,230
we're going to start setting up our
stone generator here

432
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
stone generator here
 

433
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,029
stone generator here
and basically when lava flows downward

434
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
and basically when lava flows downward
 

435
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,350
and basically when lava flows downward
onto water it creates stone

436
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
onto water it creates stone
 

437
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,070
onto water it creates stone
if water flows sideways into lava it

438
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
if water flows sideways into lava it
 

439
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,150
if water flows sideways into lava it
creates cobblestone

440
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
creates cobblestone
 

441
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,270
creates cobblestone
and i don't know if it's just me

442
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
and i don't know if it's just me
 

443
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,629
and i don't know if it's just me
but this was the hardest part of making

444
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
but this was the hardest part of making
 

445
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,870
but this was the hardest part of making
the whole farm to be honest with you

446
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
the whole farm to be honest with you
 

447
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,469
the whole farm to be honest with you
making the stone generator was a

448
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
making the stone generator was a
 

449
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,589
making the stone generator was a
nightmare

450
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
nightmare
 

451
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,510
nightmare
okay let's seal this up

452
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
okay let's seal this up
 

453
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,749
okay let's seal this up
the water can't flow out uh yeah i don't

454
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
the water can't flow out uh yeah i don't
 

455
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,510
the water can't flow out uh yeah i don't
know what the deal is with these things

456
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
know what the deal is with these things
 

457
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,189
know what the deal is with these things
like they'll work

458
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
like they'll work
 

459
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,350
like they'll work
you leave the area you come back and

460
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
you leave the area you come back and
 

461
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,270
you leave the area you come back and
it's the stone generator starts making

462
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
it's the stone generator starts making
 

463
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,790
it's the stone generator starts making
cobblestone though the water and lava

464
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
cobblestone though the water and lava
 

465
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,629
cobblestone though the water and lava
get out of sync with each other

466
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
get out of sync with each other
 

467
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,430
get out of sync with each other
and i just could not figure out

468
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
and i just could not figure out
 

469
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,270
and i just could not figure out
what to do about it until i tried a

470
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
what to do about it until i tried a
 

471
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,550
what to do about it until i tried a
bunch of different things and eventually

472
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
bunch of different things and eventually
 

473
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,990
bunch of different things and eventually
i just kind of stumbled on something

474
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
i just kind of stumbled on something
 

475
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,869
i just kind of stumbled on something
that works so what we're gonna do

476
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
that works so what we're gonna do
 

477
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,810
that works so what we're gonna do
is get a chain of repeaters here

478
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:00,820
is get a chain of repeaters here
 

479
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,990
is get a chain of repeaters here

set all of these to four except for this

482
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
set all of these to four except for this
 

483
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,150
set all of these to four except for this
one we're gonna keep it one and then

484
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
one we're gonna keep it one and then
 

485
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,790
one we're gonna keep it one and then
when the stone passes by here from the

486
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
when the stone passes by here from the
 

487
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,309
when the stone passes by here from the
stone generator it's gonna tell it to

488
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
stone generator it's gonna tell it to
 

489
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,390
stone generator it's gonna tell it to
create another one at just the right

490
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
create another one at just the right
 

491
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,710
create another one at just the right
timing

492
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
timing
 

493
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,150
timing
all right

494
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160

 

495
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,510

here they come

496
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
here they come
 

497
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,189
here they come
and you'll notice like as soon as the

498
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
and you'll notice like as soon as the
 

499
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,950
and you'll notice like as soon as the
stone gets created it gets pushed here

500
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
stone gets created it gets pushed here
 

501
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,390
stone gets created it gets pushed here
uh-huh yeah so this is kind of like a

502
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
uh-huh yeah so this is kind of like a
 

503
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,390
uh-huh yeah so this is kind of like a
double function thing it acts as a clock

504
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
double function thing it acts as a clock
 

505
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,150
double function thing it acts as a clock
for the stone generator but it also

506
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
for the stone generator but it also
 

507
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,469
for the stone generator but it also
seems to synchronize the water and lava

508
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
seems to synchronize the water and lava
 

509
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,310
seems to synchronize the water and lava
so that they don't produce

510
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
so that they don't produce
 

511
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,310
so that they don't produce
cobblestone on you even when the chunks

512
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
cobblestone on you even when the chunks
 

513
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,750
cobblestone on you even when the chunks
unload and reload

514
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
unload and reload
 

515
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,110
unload and reload
which was a huge head scratcher for me

516
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
which was a huge head scratcher for me
 

517
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,110
which was a huge head scratcher for me
so i had another big problem with stone

518
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
so i had another big problem with stone
 

519
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,670
so i had another big problem with stone
generators as well sometimes

520
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
generators as well sometimes
 

521
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,829
generators as well sometimes
the piston wouldn't push the stone when

522
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
the piston wouldn't push the stone when
 

523
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,509
the piston wouldn't push the stone when
the chunks would unload on me like if it

524
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
the chunks would unload on me like if it
 

525
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,949
the chunks would unload on me like if it
happened at just the right time or the

526
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
happened at just the right time or the
 

527
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,630
happened at just the right time or the
chunks unloaded right when the piston

528
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
chunks unloaded right when the piston
 

529
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,630
chunks unloaded right when the piston
was supposed to push it would ignore the

530
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
was supposed to push it would ignore the
 

531
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,630
was supposed to push it would ignore the
redstone signal it received and you

532
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
redstone signal it received and you
 

533
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,310
redstone signal it received and you
would find a piece of stone in front of

534
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
would find a piece of stone in front of
 

535
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,590
would find a piece of stone in front of
the generator

536
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
the generator
 

537
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,949
the generator
that it didn't push so my solution for

538
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
that it didn't push so my solution for
 

539
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,070
that it didn't push so my solution for
that problem is a countdown timer

540
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
that problem is a countdown timer
 

541
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,910
that problem is a countdown timer
where basically if you leave the chunks

542
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
where basically if you leave the chunks
 

543
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,070
where basically if you leave the chunks
and come back at just that right time

544
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
and come back at just that right time
 

545
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,829
and come back at just that right time
where it'll fail

546
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
where it'll fail
 

547
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,670
where it'll fail
uh this constantly refreshes the

548
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
uh this constantly refreshes the
 

549
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,590
uh this constantly refreshes the
countdown timer

550
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
countdown timer
 

551
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,949
countdown timer
until

552
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
until
 

553
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,110
until
the piston kind of messes up then this

554
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
the piston kind of messes up then this
 

555
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,350
the piston kind of messes up then this
will go off the torch will come on and

556
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
will go off the torch will come on and
 

557
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,350
will go off the torch will come on and
then it'll try push one more time and

558
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
then it'll try push one more time and
 

559
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,430
then it'll try push one more time and
yeah the goal of these safety systems is

560
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
yeah the goal of these safety systems is
 

561
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,870
yeah the goal of these safety systems is
we want to be able to run this farm

562
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
we want to be able to run this farm
 

563
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,670
we want to be able to run this farm
automatically like turn it on be free to

564
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
automatically like turn it on be free to
 

565
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,190
automatically like turn it on be free to
move around our world and not worry

566
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
move around our world and not worry
 

567
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,790
move around our world and not worry
about chunks unloading on us and

568
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
about chunks unloading on us and
 

569
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,269
about chunks unloading on us and
breaking the farm we want it to just run

570
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
breaking the farm we want it to just run
 

571
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,110
breaking the farm we want it to just run
all the time without like hey we're in

572
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
all the time without like hey we're in
 

573
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,030
all the time without like hey we're in
the area we have to turn the farm on

574
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
the area we have to turn the farm on
 

575
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,870
the area we have to turn the farm on
stay in the area for it to work and then

576
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
stay in the area for it to work and then
 

577
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,070
stay in the area for it to work and then
like when we're leaving the area we

578
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
like when we're leaving the area we
 

579
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,590
like when we're leaving the area we
gotta make sure we shut it off otherwise

580
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
gotta make sure we shut it off otherwise
 

581
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,910
gotta make sure we shut it off otherwise
it's gonna break on us

582
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
it's gonna break on us
 

583
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,310
it's gonna break on us
that's not that wouldn't be very good uh

584
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
that's not that wouldn't be very good uh
 

585
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,389
that's not that wouldn't be very good uh
so hopefully

586
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
so hopefully
 

587
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,389
so hopefully
what i figured out here we'll keep that

588
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
what i figured out here we'll keep that
 

589
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,590
what i figured out here we'll keep that
from happening

590
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
from happening
 

591
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,750
from happening
yeah so we go for six sticky pistons in

592
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
yeah so we go for six sticky pistons in
 

593
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,230
yeah so we go for six sticky pistons in
total each with a log in front the log

594
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
total each with a log in front the log
 

595
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,590
total each with a log in front the log
thing is a trick with tree tree growing

596
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
thing is a trick with tree tree growing
 

597
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,470
thing is a trick with tree tree growing
um

598
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
um
 

599
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,910
um
remember the three by three rule with

600
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
remember the three by three rule with
 

601
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,590
remember the three by three rule with
the azalea trees

602
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
the azalea trees
 

603
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,269
the azalea trees
when they grow here and they check the

604
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
when they grow here and they check the
 

605
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,670
when they grow here and they check the
three by three above them they ignore

606
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
three by three above them they ignore
 

607
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,829
three by three above them they ignore
logs as one of the the things that will

608
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
logs as one of the the things that will
 

609
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,430
logs as one of the the things that will
stop them from growing so this is a way

610
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
stop them from growing so this is a way
 

611
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
stop them from growing so this is a way
we can push

612
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
we can push
 

613
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,630
we can push
the tree that grows here without needing

614
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
the tree that grows here without needing
 

615
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,350
the tree that grows here without needing
a double extender with the the pistons

616
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
a double extender with the the pistons
 

617
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,030
a double extender with the the pistons
then we run our redstone line up there

618
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
then we run our redstone line up there
 

619
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,509
then we run our redstone line up there
and we're going to add one more slab at

620
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
and we're going to add one more slab at
 

621
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,750
and we're going to add one more slab at
the top here because otherwise

622
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
the top here because otherwise
 

623
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,509
the top here because otherwise
a log will eventually grow here and cut

624
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
a log will eventually grow here and cut
 

625
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,750
a log will eventually grow here and cut
the wire this prevents a log from

626
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
the wire this prevents a log from
 

627
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,509
the wire this prevents a log from
appearing in the spot right there are

628
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
appearing in the spot right there are
 

629
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,350
appearing in the spot right there are
you ready for the logic part of the farm

630
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
you ready for the logic part of the farm
 

631
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,790
you ready for the logic part of the farm
this is

632
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
this is
 

633
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,949
this is
the tough part of the farm okay

634
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
the tough part of the farm okay
 

635
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,350
the tough part of the farm okay
uh yeah i worked really hard at

636
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
uh yeah i worked really hard at
 

637
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,670
uh yeah i worked really hard at
compacting this i hope you appreciate it

638
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
compacting this i hope you appreciate it
 

639
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,790
compacting this i hope you appreciate it
even if you don't understand it ah

640
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
even if you don't understand it ah
 

641
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,110
even if you don't understand it ah
here we go okay so the goal is by the

642
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
here we go okay so the goal is by the
 

643
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,790
here we go okay so the goal is by the
way to get the moss to spread to this

644
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
way to get the moss to spread to this
 

645
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,470
way to get the moss to spread to this
block and then grow the tree on top of

646
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
block and then grow the tree on top of
 

647
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,110
block and then grow the tree on top of
it

648
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
it
 

649
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,269
it
so what we do is we bow meal the moss

650
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
so what we do is we bow meal the moss
 

651
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,269
so what we do is we bow meal the moss
with this dispenser it's facing towards

652
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
with this dispenser it's facing towards
 

653
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,269
with this dispenser it's facing towards
it right we also need to remove the

654
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
it right we also need to remove the
 

655
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,790
it right we also need to remove the
grass that grows on top of the moss

656
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
grass that grows on top of the moss
 

657
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,870
grass that grows on top of the moss
otherwise it can't grow anymore

658
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
otherwise it can't grow anymore
 

659
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,949
otherwise it can't grow anymore
which means i need a piston

660
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
which means i need a piston
 

661
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,630
which means i need a piston
i totally forgot about that part okay

662
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
i totally forgot about that part okay
 

663
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,550
i totally forgot about that part okay
that goes right on top dispenser breaks

664
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
that goes right on top dispenser breaks
 

665
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,430
that goes right on top dispenser breaks
the grass that spawns on top there

666
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
the grass that spawns on top there
 

667
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,350
the grass that spawns on top there
easy peasy right well then what we got

668
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
easy peasy right well then what we got
 

669
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,110
easy peasy right well then what we got
to do is we got to take the observer

670
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
to do is we got to take the observer
 

671
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,269
to do is we got to take the observer
this updates when the block moves right

672
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
this updates when the block moves right
 

673
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,910
this updates when the block moves right
and then it goes to

674
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
and then it goes to
 

675
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,910
and then it goes to
the block here with the redstone dust on

676
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
the block here with the redstone dust on
 

677
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,790
the block here with the redstone dust on
top

678
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
top
 

679
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,630
top
this activates both the piston and the

680
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
this activates both the piston and the
 

681
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,550
this activates both the piston and the
dispenser and it seems like the

682
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
dispenser and it seems like the
 

683
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,949
dispenser and it seems like the
dispenser triggers before the piston for

684
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
dispenser triggers before the piston for
 

685
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,069
dispenser triggers before the piston for
just update order reasons

686
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
just update order reasons
 

687
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,829
just update order reasons
then we take the signal from there it

688
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
then we take the signal from there it
 

689
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,310
then we take the signal from there it
goes across over this way also we need

690
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
goes across over this way also we need
 

691
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,230
goes across over this way also we need
to grow the tree that's here using

692
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
to grow the tree that's here using
 

693
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,670
to grow the tree that's here using
another dispenser

694
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
another dispenser
 

695
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,670
another dispenser
which is over here which gets powered by

696
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
which is over here which gets powered by
 

697
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,670
which is over here which gets powered by
this as well we also need to place box

698
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
this as well we also need to place box
 

699
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,190
this as well we also need to place box
over top of this stone here otherwise

700
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
over top of this stone here otherwise
 

701
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,630
over top of this stone here otherwise
this will convert to moss we need three

702
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
this will convert to moss we need three
 

703
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,509
this will convert to moss we need three
of them

704
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
of them
 

705
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,430
of them
because that's how far it extends to

706
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
because that's how far it extends to
 

707
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,310
because that's how far it extends to
now

708
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
now
 

709
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,310
now
what we got to do is take the signal

710
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
what we got to do is take the signal
 

711
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,509
what we got to do is take the signal
from here

712
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
from here
 

713
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,509
from here
and send it to there

714
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
and send it to there
 

715
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,829
and send it to there
while also sending the signal

716
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
while also sending the signal
 

717
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,230
while also sending the signal
back this way with just the right timing

718
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
back this way with just the right timing
 

719
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,670
back this way with just the right timing
so that this triggers more than once we

720
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
so that this triggers more than once we
 

721
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,430
so that this triggers more than once we
want it to trigger twice

722
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
want it to trigger twice
 

723
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,150
want it to trigger twice
okay and then uh what do we do here i

724
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
okay and then uh what do we do here i
 

725
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,269
okay and then uh what do we do here i
don't even know uh no i do know

726
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
don't even know uh no i do know
 

727
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,190
don't even know uh no i do know
i think we want three repeaters this

728
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
i think we want three repeaters this
 

729
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,190
i think we want three repeaters this
one's set to four this one at one this

730
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
one's set to four this one at one this
 

731
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,509
one's set to four this one at one this
one before so when this repeater updates

732
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
one before so when this repeater updates
 

733
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,670
one before so when this repeater updates
it triggers this and gets another pulse

734
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
it triggers this and gets another pulse
 

735
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,870
it triggers this and gets another pulse
to the dispenser growing the tree

736
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
to the dispenser growing the tree
 

737
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,389
to the dispenser growing the tree
what else oh yeah we want to get another

738
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
what else oh yeah we want to get another
 

739
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,670
what else oh yeah we want to get another
pulse to this one because remember

740
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
pulse to this one because remember
 

741
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,590
pulse to this one because remember
sometimes you get air

742
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
sometimes you get air
 

743
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,509
sometimes you get air
blocks even after you bone meal this so

744
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
blocks even after you bone meal this so
 

745
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,829
blocks even after you bone meal this so
to improve our chances of us getting

746
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
to improve our chances of us getting
 

747
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,030
to improve our chances of us getting
something to grow there we're going to

748
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
something to grow there we're going to
 

749
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,190
something to grow there we're going to
trigger it twice

750
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
trigger it twice
 

751
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,590
trigger it twice
using another delayed

752
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
using another delayed
 

753
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,670
using another delayed
pulse going to it and that's it that's

754
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
pulse going to it and that's it that's
 

755
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,110
pulse going to it and that's it that's
the tree farm so it should be able to

756
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
the tree farm so it should be able to
 

757
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,350
the tree farm so it should be able to
grow trees now let's give it a try here

758
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
grow trees now let's give it a try here
 

759
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,430
grow trees now let's give it a try here
we got these loaded with bone meal to

760
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
we got these loaded with bone meal to
 

761
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,190
we got these loaded with bone meal to
start this farm if it ever gets stuck

762
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
start this farm if it ever gets stuck
 

763
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,629
start this farm if it ever gets stuck
like if it runs out of bone meal or you

764
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
like if it runs out of bone meal or you
 

765
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,230
like if it runs out of bone meal or you
run out of tnt you got to break that

766
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
run out of tnt you got to break that
 

767
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,310
run out of tnt you got to break that
block right there

768
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
block right there
 

769
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,069
block right there
where the trees grow

770
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
where the trees grow
 

771
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,310
where the trees grow
and then we just send a pulse to this to

772
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
and then we just send a pulse to this to
 

773
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,949
and then we just send a pulse to this to
get it started again

774
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
get it started again
 

775
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,509
get it started again
all right yeah we got a tree farm did i

776
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
all right yeah we got a tree farm did i
 

777
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,389
all right yeah we got a tree farm did i
mess up let's find out

778
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
mess up let's find out
 

779
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,310
mess up let's find out
oh i got moss in the area here so it's

780
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
oh i got moss in the area here so it's
 

781
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,190
oh i got moss in the area here so it's
spreading everywhere oh my goodness

782
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
spreading everywhere oh my goodness
 

783
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,790
spreading everywhere oh my goodness
i gotta remove that

784
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
i gotta remove that
 

785
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,069
i gotta remove that
oh we got our first trees

786
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079

 

787
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,030

uh-huh

788
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
uh-huh
 

789
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,870
uh-huh
so as soon as the stone gets pushed here

790
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
so as soon as the stone gets pushed here
 

791
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,590
so as soon as the stone gets pushed here
it gets converted to moss and then

792
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
it gets converted to moss and then
 

793
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,590
it gets converted to moss and then
a couple plants grow here

794
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
a couple plants grow here
 

795
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,629
a couple plants grow here
it tries twice oh there's another azalea

796
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
it tries twice oh there's another azalea
 

797
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,629
it tries twice oh there's another azalea
awesome okay so it seems to be working i

798
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
awesome okay so it seems to be working i
 

799
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,910
awesome okay so it seems to be working i
just shut it off for now we got a few

800
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
just shut it off for now we got a few
 

801
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,350
just shut it off for now we got a few
more things left to build here but this

802
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
more things left to build here but this
 

803
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,790
more things left to build here but this
is what it does it basically creates a

804
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
is what it does it basically creates a
 

805
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,550
is what it does it basically creates a
long strip of wood here

806
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
long strip of wood here
 

807
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,470
long strip of wood here
and uh the root of dirt underneath and

808
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
and uh the root of dirt underneath and
 

809
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,150
and uh the root of dirt underneath and
then we gotta blow that up and collect

810
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
then we gotta blow that up and collect
 

811
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,750
then we gotta blow that up and collect
it in a collection system so that's what

812
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
it in a collection system so that's what
 

813
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,430
it in a collection system so that's what
this is over here

814
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
this is over here
 

815
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,269
this is over here
it's uh five wide

816
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
it's uh five wide
 

817
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,150
it's uh five wide
we're gonna put water here

818
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
we're gonna put water here
 

819
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,470
we're gonna put water here
fill this up

820
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
fill this up
 

821
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,550
fill this up
and

822
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
and
 

823
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,949
and
it is exactly like the tree grows here

824
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
it is exactly like the tree grows here
 

825
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,230
it is exactly like the tree grows here
so it's a one

826
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
so it's a one
 

827
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,910
so it's a one
two and then a third block is where the

828
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
two and then a third block is where the
 

829
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,910
two and then a third block is where the
water is that travels eight blocks the

830
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
water is that travels eight blocks the
 

831
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,110
water is that travels eight blocks the
end here

832
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
end here
 

833
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,710
end here
and then we're gonna put another water

834
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
and then we're gonna put another water
 

835
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,710
and then we're gonna put another water
source uh it doesn't really matter where

836
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
source uh it doesn't really matter where
 

837
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,310
source uh it doesn't really matter where
i'll put it there

838
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
i'll put it there
 

839
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,150
i'll put it there
and then that's gonna go to

840
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
and then that's gonna go to
 

841
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,990
and then that's gonna go to
just a hopper for now

842
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
just a hopper for now
 

843
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,550
just a hopper for now
until i do something more fancy

844
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
until i do something more fancy
 

845
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,389
until i do something more fancy
uh hopper

846
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
uh hopper
 

847
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,389
uh hopper
it'll put the logs and stuff into a

848
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
it'll put the logs and stuff into a
 

849
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,110
it'll put the logs and stuff into a
chest so that we don't lose it

850
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
chest so that we don't lose it
 

851
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,150
chest so that we don't lose it
like so

852
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
like so
 

853
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,150
like so
and then i'm just gonna put a trapdoor

854
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
and then i'm just gonna put a trapdoor
 

855
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,189
and then i'm just gonna put a trapdoor
uh over here

856
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
uh over here
 

857
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,389
uh over here
all right so that should pick up the

858
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
all right so that should pick up the
 

859
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,870
all right so that should pick up the
stuff that lands in the water here

860
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
stuff that lands in the water here
 

861
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,629
stuff that lands in the water here
nice and easy

862
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
nice and easy
 

863
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,629
nice and easy
next up here we're going to set up a tnt

864
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
next up here we're going to set up a tnt
 

865
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,310
next up here we're going to set up a tnt
system for harvesting the wood from the

866
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
system for harvesting the wood from the
 

867
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,430
system for harvesting the wood from the
tree farm

868
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
tree farm
 

869
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,430
tree farm
and while building this farm originally

870
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
and while building this farm originally
 

871
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,590
and while building this farm originally
i had the tnt system up in the air like

872
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
i had the tnt system up in the air like
 

873
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,750
i had the tnt system up in the air like
most farms and i came up with a pretty

874
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
most farms and i came up with a pretty
 

875
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,590
most farms and i came up with a pretty
cool trick i think

876
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
cool trick i think
 

877
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,990
cool trick i think
um like normally you gotta drop the tnt

878
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
um like normally you gotta drop the tnt
 

879
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,829
um like normally you gotta drop the tnt
at least eight blocks so it doesn't blow

880
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
at least eight blocks so it doesn't blow
 

881
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,069
at least eight blocks so it doesn't blow
up the dispenser it comes from oh i

882
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
up the dispenser it comes from oh i
 

883
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,189
up the dispenser it comes from oh i
should not have placed this here

884
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
should not have placed this here
 

885
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,389
should not have placed this here
wait is that the right spot yeah that's

886
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
wait is that the right spot yeah that's
 

887
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,910
wait is that the right spot yeah that's
the right spot i think

888
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
the right spot i think
 

889
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,310
the right spot i think
okay i'm gonna just put a piece of brick

890
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
okay i'm gonna just put a piece of brick
 

891
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,069
okay i'm gonna just put a piece of brick
underneath there yeah check this out so

892
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
underneath there yeah check this out so
 

893
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,470
underneath there yeah check this out so
what you do you put your tnt in here you

894
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
what you do you put your tnt in here you
 

895
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,590
what you do you put your tnt in here you
put a stair on top water

896
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
put a stair on top water
 

897
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,750
put a stair on top water
and then when the tnt ejects here the

898
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
and then when the tnt ejects here the
 

899
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,150
and then when the tnt ejects here the
water carries it right to the end

900
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
water carries it right to the end
 

901
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,829
water carries it right to the end
and that way you don't need to drop it

902
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
and that way you don't need to drop it
 

903
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,670
and that way you don't need to drop it
you don't need to run redstone up up

904
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
you don't need to run redstone up up
 

905
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,430
you don't need to run redstone up up
there you don't need to shield the

906
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
there you don't need to shield the
 

907
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,069
there you don't need to shield the
redstone from the blast it's all just so

908
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
redstone from the blast it's all just so
 

909
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,670
redstone from the blast it's all just so
much simpler we just activate it from

910
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
much simpler we just activate it from
 

911
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,430
much simpler we just activate it from
underneath okay i just put a button here

912
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
underneath okay i just put a button here
 

913
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,870
underneath okay i just put a button here
so we can manually trigger and i'll show

914
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
so we can manually trigger and i'll show
 

915
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,870
so we can manually trigger and i'll show
you how it works so yeah up comes the

916
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
you how it works so yeah up comes the
 

917
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,590
you how it works so yeah up comes the
tnt the water carries it to the end

918
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
tnt the water carries it to the end
 

919
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,829
tnt the water carries it to the end
and the water shields the dispenser from

920
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
and the water shields the dispenser from
 

921
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,509
and the water shields the dispenser from
getting blown up as well

922
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
getting blown up as well
 

923
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,590
getting blown up as well
and then all the logs land into the

924
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
and then all the logs land into the
 

925
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,230
and then all the logs land into the
water stream and up in here and the dirt

926
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
water stream and up in here and the dirt
 

927
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
water stream and up in here and the dirt
okay so we don't want to trigger this

928
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
okay so we don't want to trigger this
 

929
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,230
okay so we don't want to trigger this
every single time a tree grows though so

930
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
every single time a tree grows though so
 

931
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,910
every single time a tree grows though so
we got to add some kind of counting

932
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
we got to add some kind of counting
 

933
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,470
we got to add some kind of counting
system for our farm as well here's how

934
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
system for our farm as well here's how
 

935
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,430
system for our farm as well here's how
we're going to do that we're going to

936
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
we're going to do that we're going to
 

937
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,590
we're going to do that we're going to
take the signal from

938
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
take the signal from
 

939
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,790
take the signal from
here

940
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
here
 

941
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,629
here
so whenever a tree gets grown this gets

942
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
so whenever a tree gets grown this gets
 

943
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,629
so whenever a tree gets grown this gets
triggered and then we're going to send

944
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
triggered and then we're going to send
 

945
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,949
triggered and then we're going to send
that down to a counter i'm going to put

946
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
that down to a counter i'm going to put
 

947
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,710
that down to a counter i'm going to put
two droppers

948
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
two droppers
 

949
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,790
two droppers
facing each other

950
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
facing each other
 

951
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,949
facing each other
like so we'll trigger this one by

952
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
like so we'll trigger this one by
 

953
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,870
like so we'll trigger this one by
putting a block above the observer will

954
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
putting a block above the observer will
 

955
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,389
putting a block above the observer will
trigger it that way

956
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
trigger it that way
 

957
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,030
trigger it that way
and then we're going to go down here in

958
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
and then we're going to go down here in
 

959
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,829
and then we're going to go down here in
the corner of our our water system

960
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
the corner of our our water system
 

961
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,150
the corner of our our water system
and put a comparator

962
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
and put a comparator
 

963
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,069
and put a comparator
pull the signal from here

964
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
pull the signal from here
 

965
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,550
pull the signal from here
then we put redstone here that'll go

966
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
then we put redstone here that'll go
 

967
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,110
then we put redstone here that'll go
back this way

968
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
back this way
 

969
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,670
back this way
and i don't have blocks

970
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
and i don't have blocks
 

971
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,990
and i don't have blocks
i'm gonna carry the signal this way

972
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
i'm gonna carry the signal this way
 

973
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,189
i'm gonna carry the signal this way
and then we're gonna add a repeater

974
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
and then we're gonna add a repeater
 

975
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,269
and then we're gonna add a repeater
set to four

976
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
set to four
 

977
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,829
set to four
this will go to

978
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
this will go to
 

979
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,150
this will go to
a i think i want a sticky piston here

980
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
a i think i want a sticky piston here
 

981
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,629
a i think i want a sticky piston here
with a block on top

982
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
with a block on top
 

983
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,470
with a block on top
no not a block i want observer yeah

984
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
no not a block i want observer yeah
 

985
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,150
no not a block i want observer yeah
we're going to set up a observer clock

986
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
we're going to set up a observer clock
 

987
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,069
we're going to set up a observer clock
here so you know how observer clocks

988
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
here so you know how observer clocks
 

989
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,150
here so you know how observer clocks
work they

990
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
work they
 

991
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,430
work they
oh

992
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
oh
 

993
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,350
oh
yeah if you have two observers facing

994
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
yeah if you have two observers facing
 

995
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,069
yeah if you have two observers facing
each other they constantly pulse

996
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
each other they constantly pulse
 

997
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,829
each other they constantly pulse
see how they're ticking like that so the

998
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
see how they're ticking like that so the
 

999
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,230
see how they're ticking like that so the
pistons gonna push this up

1000
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
pistons gonna push this up
 

1001
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,310
pistons gonna push this up
and then it's gonna trigger and send the

1002
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
and then it's gonna trigger and send the
 

1003
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,310
and then it's gonna trigger and send the
items in this dropper back to that one

1004
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
items in this dropper back to that one
 

1005
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,069
items in this dropper back to that one
our goal with this is when five items

1006
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
our goal with this is when five items
 

1007
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,829
our goal with this is when five items
enter this dropper we want to send them

1008
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
enter this dropper we want to send them
 

1009
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,590
enter this dropper we want to send them
back to that dropper to reset it and

1010
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
back to that dropper to reset it and
 

1011
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,150
back to that dropper to reset it and
then also shoot out a tnt here this is a

1012
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
then also shoot out a tnt here this is a
 

1013
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,230
then also shoot out a tnt here this is a
bit of a janky uh counter i made just

1014
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
bit of a janky uh counter i made just
 

1015
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,150
bit of a janky uh counter i made just
for this tree farm so it's a little a

1016
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
for this tree farm so it's a little a
 

1017
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,910
for this tree farm so it's a little a
little weird

1018
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
little weird
 

1019
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,509
little weird
uh put that in subtract mode and then

1020
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
uh put that in subtract mode and then
 

1021
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,069
uh put that in subtract mode and then
we're gonna fill this up with uh four

1022
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
we're gonna fill this up with uh four
 

1023
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,630
we're gonna fill this up with uh four
stacks of items plus sixteen

1024
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
stacks of items plus sixteen
 

1025
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,669
stacks of items plus sixteen
roughly

1026
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
roughly
 

1027
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,710
roughly
uh-huh uh if you do copy this uh counter

1028
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
uh-huh uh if you do copy this uh counter
 

1029
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,390
uh-huh uh if you do copy this uh counter
just keep in mind it will only work for

1030
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
just keep in mind it will only work for
 

1031
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,029
just keep in mind it will only work for
up to five items max count up to five

1032
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
up to five items max count up to five
 

1033
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,029
up to five items max count up to five
maximum

1034
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
maximum
 

1035
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,069
maximum
okay and sixteen okay so now

1036
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
okay and sixteen okay so now
 

1037
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,390
okay and sixteen okay so now
what's gonna happen is when we put

1038
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
what's gonna happen is when we put
 

1039
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,470
what's gonna happen is when we put
swords in here or an item that doesn't

1040
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
swords in here or an item that doesn't
 

1041
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
swords in here or an item that doesn't
stack five of them

1042
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
stack five of them
 

1043
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,950
stack five of them
it should reset where's my last one

1044
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960

 

1045
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,870

i only made four apparently oh no it's

1046
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
i only made four apparently oh no it's
 

1047
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,590
i only made four apparently oh no it's
my inventory okay here we go

1048
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
my inventory okay here we go
 

1049
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,590
my inventory okay here we go
that pops up and then those items go

1050
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
that pops up and then those items go
 

1051
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,990
that pops up and then those items go
back into that one and it sends a signal

1052
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
back into that one and it sends a signal
 

1053
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,270
back into that one and it sends a signal
here right so now we're going to take

1054
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
here right so now we're going to take
 

1055
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,710
here right so now we're going to take
that signal

1056
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
that signal
 

1057
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,150
that signal
and send it over to the tnt system so to

1058
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
and send it over to the tnt system so to
 

1059
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,350
and send it over to the tnt system so to
do that

1060
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
do that
 

1061
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,430
do that
it just so happens those five swords the

1062
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
it just so happens those five swords the
 

1063
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,310
it just so happens those five swords the
signal reaches exactly to here

1064
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
signal reaches exactly to here
 

1065
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,909
signal reaches exactly to here
oh it's almost like i find that right

1066
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
oh it's almost like i find that right
 

1067
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,070
oh it's almost like i find that right
and then we we're gonna run a redstone

1068
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
and then we we're gonna run a redstone
 

1069
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,430
and then we we're gonna run a redstone
torch up here

1070
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
torch up here
 

1071
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,669
torch up here
target block so it connects to it

1072
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
target block so it connects to it
 

1073
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,110
target block so it connects to it
and then

1074
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
and then
 

1075
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,110
and then
our dispenser with the tnt is there we

1076
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
our dispenser with the tnt is there we
 

1077
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,830
our dispenser with the tnt is there we
run away

1078
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840

 

1079
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,029

and then we're free to cover all that

1080
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
and then we're free to cover all that
 

1081
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,310
and then we're free to cover all that
stuff up and it doesn't look too bad

1082
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
stuff up and it doesn't look too bad
 

1083
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,070
stuff up and it doesn't look too bad
right pretty clean presentation to the

1084
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
right pretty clean presentation to the
 

1085
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,029
right pretty clean presentation to the
farm

1086
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
farm
 

1087
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,830
farm
uh

1088
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
uh
 

1089
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,029
uh
yeah i thought we're gonna get this done

1090
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
yeah i thought we're gonna get this done
 

1091
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,510
yeah i thought we're gonna get this done
10 minutes tops right

1092
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
10 minutes tops right
 

1093
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,750
10 minutes tops right
yeah we're still going here oh it's a

1094
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
yeah we're still going here oh it's a
 

1095
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,510
yeah we're still going here oh it's a
good thing we didn't uh design this

1096
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
good thing we didn't uh design this
 

1097
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,029
good thing we didn't uh design this
together too or

1098
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
together too or
 

1099
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,110
together too or
we'd be looking at 20 20 episodes on

1100
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
we'd be looking at 20 20 episodes on
 

1101
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,470
we'd be looking at 20 20 episodes on
this thing i think

1102
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
this thing i think
 

1103
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,549

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
long episode today guys um
 

1109
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,909
long episode today guys um
i thought we're gonna get this done a

1110
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
i thought we're gonna get this done a
 

1111
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,510
i thought we're gonna get this done a
lot faster than we are i still want to

1112
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
lot faster than we are i still want to
 

1113
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,750
lot faster than we are i still want to
build some stuff okay so

1114
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
build some stuff okay so
 

1115
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,510
build some stuff okay so
you'll notice like moss is shooting out

1116
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
you'll notice like moss is shooting out
 

1117
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,350
you'll notice like moss is shooting out
here and getting collected so we can

1118
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
here and getting collected so we can
 

1119
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,190
here and getting collected so we can
either drop that into

1120
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
either drop that into
 

1121
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,789
either drop that into
water to collect it or we can put a

1122
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
water to collect it or we can put a
 

1123
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,789
water to collect it or we can put a
hopper we want to compost it we can

1124
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
hopper we want to compost it we can
 

1125
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,789
hopper we want to compost it we can
compost it

1126
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
compost it
 

1127
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,230
compost it
and then reclaim some of the bone meal

1128
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
and then reclaim some of the bone meal
 

1129
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,990
and then reclaim some of the bone meal
that way for the farm i actually want to

1130
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
that way for the farm i actually want to
 

1131
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,150
that way for the farm i actually want to
keep this moss and stuff it's creating

1132
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
keep this moss and stuff it's creating
 

1133
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,750
keep this moss and stuff it's creating
because i don't have a moss farm built

1134
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
because i don't have a moss farm built
 

1135
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,390
because i don't have a moss farm built
in our let's play just yet so i'm gonna

1136
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
in our let's play just yet so i'm gonna
 

1137
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,590
in our let's play just yet so i'm gonna
i'm gonna be storing this stuff for now

1138
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
i'm gonna be storing this stuff for now
 

1139
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,390
i'm gonna be storing this stuff for now
oh

1140
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
oh
 

1141
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,950
oh
all right

1142
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960

 

1143
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,470

something like that should work and then

1144
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
something like that should work and then
 

1145
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,190
something like that should work and then
we wanna make sure

1146
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
we wanna make sure
 

1147
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,230
we wanna make sure
like

1148
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
like
 

1149
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,230
like
this stuff doesn't fly everywhere

1150
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
this stuff doesn't fly everywhere
 

1151
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,150
this stuff doesn't fly everywhere
so what we're gonna do i'm gonna have a

1152
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
so what we're gonna do i'm gonna have a
 

1153
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,630
so what we're gonna do i'm gonna have a
nice viewing window with glass here

1154
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
nice viewing window with glass here
 

1155
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,870
nice viewing window with glass here
we can put glass there but then remember

1156
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
we can put glass there but then remember
 

1157
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,390
we can put glass there but then remember
the three by three rule we can't put

1158
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
the three by three rule we can't put
 

1159
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,070
the three by three rule we can't put
glass here oh first first batch

1160
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
glass here oh first first batch
 

1161
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,430
glass here oh first first batch
uh because then it'll stop the trees

1162
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
uh because then it'll stop the trees
 

1163
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,669
uh because then it'll stop the trees
from growing so we can put leaves though

1164
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
from growing so we can put leaves though
 

1165
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,430
from growing so we can put leaves though
so i'm gonna put leaves there

1166
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
so i'm gonna put leaves there
 

1167
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,230
so i'm gonna put leaves there
just to keep everything contained

1168
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
just to keep everything contained
 

1169
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,909
just to keep everything contained
all right

1170
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
all right
 

1171
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,390
all right
and then we can cover that back up and

1172
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
and then we can cover that back up and
 

1173
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,830
and then we can cover that back up and
if we ever need to break that block to

1174
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
if we ever need to break that block to
 

1175
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,270
if we ever need to break that block to
restart the farm we can just put this

1176
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
restart the farm we can just put this
 

1177
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,070
restart the farm we can just put this
trap door break it and put it back

1178
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
trap door break it and put it back
 

1179
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,830
trap door break it and put it back
okay then

1180
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
okay then
 

1181
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,909
okay then
uh what else here yeah let's add uh a

1182
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
uh what else here yeah let's add uh a
 

1183
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,909
uh what else here yeah let's add uh a
system for the bone meal on this

1184
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
system for the bone meal on this
 

1185
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,190
system for the bone meal on this
so we can run hoppers to this dispenser

1186
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
so we can run hoppers to this dispenser
 

1187
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,270
so we can run hoppers to this dispenser
and

1188
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
and
 

1189
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,350
and
then a chest double chest

1190
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
then a chest double chest
 

1191
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,830
then a chest double chest
and then i think we can do hoppers here

1192
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
and then i think we can do hoppers here
 

1193
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,990
and then i think we can do hoppers here
we gotta run boatmeal to this dispenser

1194
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
we gotta run boatmeal to this dispenser
 

1195
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,710
we gotta run boatmeal to this dispenser
as well so hopper

1196
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
as well so hopper
 

1197
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,390
as well so hopper
chest and chest and this is outside of

1198
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
chest and chest and this is outside of
 

1199
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,070
chest and chest and this is outside of
the range of the tnt just barely

1200
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
the range of the tnt just barely
 

1201
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,710
the range of the tnt just barely
uh okay then

1202
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
uh okay then
 

1203
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,630
uh okay then
that will get another double chest here

1204
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
that will get another double chest here
 

1205
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,390
that will get another double chest here
and then a hopper facing into that

1206
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
and then a hopper facing into that
 

1207
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,909
and then a hopper facing into that
double chest here and they kind of meet

1208
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
double chest here and they kind of meet
 

1209
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,149
double chest here and they kind of meet
together and then when you fill

1210
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
together and then when you fill
 

1211
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,990
together and then when you fill
this chest with bone meal it'll funnel

1212
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
this chest with bone meal it'll funnel
 

1213
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,350
this chest with bone meal it'll funnel
to both sides and you've got a nice

1214
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
to both sides and you've got a nice
 

1215
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,390
to both sides and you've got a nice
storage

1216
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
storage
 

1217
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,909
storage
and you can add more chests if you want

1218
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
and you can add more chests if you want
 

1219
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,830
and you can add more chests if you want
more storage for that now remember we're

1220
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
more storage for that now remember we're
 

1221
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,510
more storage for that now remember we're
also making like moss and and seeds and

1222
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
also making like moss and and seeds and
 

1223
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,590
also making like moss and and seeds and
the the plants and stuff over here from

1224
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
the the plants and stuff over here from
 

1225
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,990
the the plants and stuff over here from
this uh one as well so

1226
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
this uh one as well so
 

1227
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,990
this uh one as well so
if we want to collect that we can trap

1228
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
if we want to collect that we can trap
 

1229
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,750
if we want to collect that we can trap
it with leaves here as well

1230
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
it with leaves here as well
 

1231
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,430
it with leaves here as well
they'll kind of stay contained that way

1232
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
they'll kind of stay contained that way
 

1233
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,110
they'll kind of stay contained that way
and if we put a hopper minecart

1234
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
and if we put a hopper minecart
 

1235
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,029
and if we put a hopper minecart
underneath that moss block

1236
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
underneath that moss block
 

1237
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,190
underneath that moss block
we can pick up most of stuff and with

1238
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
we can pick up most of stuff and with
 

1239
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,029
we can pick up most of stuff and with
that we are actually done building the

1240
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
that we are actually done building the
 

1241
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,870
that we are actually done building the
tree farm i just want to talk about a

1242
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
tree farm i just want to talk about a
 

1243
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,630
tree farm i just want to talk about a
couple quick things again if you want to

1244
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
couple quick things again if you want to
 

1245
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,390
couple quick things again if you want to
restart the tree farm if it stops for

1246
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
restart the tree farm if it stops for
 

1247
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,830
restart the tree farm if it stops for
some reason the blocks here you got to

1248
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
some reason the blocks here you got to
 

1249
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,110
some reason the blocks here you got to
break that

1250
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
break that
 

1251
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,470
break that
and then you run over here hit the

1252
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
and then you run over here hit the
 

1253
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,430
and then you run over here hit the
button

1254
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
button
 

1255
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,990
button
uh i think i might add a proper way of

1256
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
uh i think i might add a proper way of
 

1257
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,750
uh i think i might add a proper way of
shutting this down for right now if i

1258
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
shutting this down for right now if i
 

1259
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,750
shutting this down for right now if i
ever want to shut it down

1260
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
ever want to shut it down
 

1261
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,630
ever want to shut it down
this is why i do i just break a repeater

1262
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
this is why i do i just break a repeater
 

1263
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,549
this is why i do i just break a repeater
not the most fancy thing i wait for this

1264
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
not the most fancy thing i wait for this
 

1265
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,190
not the most fancy thing i wait for this
thing to shut off

1266
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
thing to shut off
 

1267
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,549
thing to shut off
and then i'm free to put it back and

1268
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
and then i'm free to put it back and
 

1269
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,710
and then i'm free to put it back and
it's shut down so this runs totally

1270
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
it's shut down so this runs totally
 

1271
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,110
it's shut down so this runs totally
automatically but there is a semi afk

1272
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
automatically but there is a semi afk
 

1273
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,110
automatically but there is a semi afk
mode you can use with it as well if you

1274
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
mode you can use with it as well if you
 

1275
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,110
mode you can use with it as well if you
want you can kind of stand inside there

1276
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
want you can kind of stand inside there
 

1277
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,029
want you can kind of stand inside there
and hold right click with some azalea

1278
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
and hold right click with some azalea
 

1279
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,470
and hold right click with some azalea
trees

1280
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
trees
 

1281
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,669
trees
if you want to grow them quickly you

1282
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
if you want to grow them quickly you
 

1283
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,630
if you want to grow them quickly you
know

1284
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640

awesome let's move on here so we got our
tree farm built it's good to go

1382
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
tree farm built it's good to go
 

1383
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,350
tree farm built it's good to go
and uh before i can collect some wood

1384
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
and uh before i can collect some wood
 

1385
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,029
and uh before i can collect some wood
from it though i do need to gather a

1386
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
from it though i do need to gather a
 

1387
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,950
from it though i do need to gather a
bunch of bone meal to feed it

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
bunch of bone meal to feed it
 

1389
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,549
bunch of bone meal to feed it
at some point i really want to build

1390
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
at some point i really want to build
 

1391
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,510

moss farm in our world to like
 

1395
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,029
moss farm in our world to like
mass-produce bone meal but until then

mass-produce bone meal but until then
 

1397
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,269
mass-produce bone meal but until then
this is my best source of bone meal i

1398

this is my best source of bone meal i
 

1399
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,789

just to talk about the theming or kind

1402
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
just to talk about the theming or kind
 

1403
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,430
just to talk about the theming or kind
of the lore of our world here so when we

1404
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
of the lore of our world here so when we
 

1405
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,510
of the lore of our world here so when we
look around the man cave right it's got

1406
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
look around the man cave right it's got
 

1407
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,830
look around the man cave right it's got
almost a clean look to it

1408
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
almost a clean look to it
 

1409
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,990
almost a clean look to it
like all on the path here it's nice and

1410
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
like all on the path here it's nice and
 

1411
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,510
like all on the path here it's nice and
clean there's no grass it's like

1412
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
clean there's no grass it's like
 

1413
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,830

somebody's living here somebody's taking

1414
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
somebody's living here somebody's taking
 

1415
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,990
somebody's living here somebody's taking
care of it it's well manicured just off

1416
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
care of it it's well manicured just off
 

1417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,590
care of it it's well manicured just off
the beaten path you know it's a bit more

1418
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
the beaten path you know it's a bit more
 

1419
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,269
the beaten path you know it's a bit more
rough there's there's shrubs and stuff

1420
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
rough there's there's shrubs and stuff
 

1421
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,190

1423
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,190
that haven't been taken care of so yeah
for this area underneath the man cave i

1424
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
for this area underneath the man cave i
 

1425
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,630
for this area underneath the man cave i
really like the idea of keeping it

1426
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
really like the idea of keeping it
 

1427
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,470
really like the idea of keeping it
overgrown like this like this was what

1428
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
overgrown like this like this was what
 

1429
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,789
overgrown like this like this was what
the man cave was before we conquered it

1430
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
the man cave was before we conquered it
 

1431
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,950
the man cave was before we conquered it
kind of idea and we're going to try to

1432
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
kind of idea and we're going to try to
 

1433
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,190
kind of idea and we're going to try to
develop the roughness a bit like we

1434
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
develop the roughness a bit like we
 

1435
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,590
develop the roughness a bit like we
don't want it to be so scattered and

1436
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
don't want it to be so scattered and
 

1437
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,110
don't want it to be so scattered and
undefined

1438
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
undefined
 

1439
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,789
undefined
we want to try to add some definition to

1440
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
we want to try to add some definition to
 

1441
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,549
we want to try to add some definition to
the roughness i guess is

1442
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
the roughness i guess is
 

1443
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,590
the roughness i guess is
the goal

1444
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
the goal
 

1445
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,909
the goal
uh the idea that kind of comes to me

1446
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
uh the idea that kind of comes to me
 

1447
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,110
uh the idea that kind of comes to me
when i look at this is terraria jungles

1448
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
when i look at this is terraria jungles
 

1449
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,630
when i look at this is terraria jungles
right

1450
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
right
 

1451
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,230
right
i'm really getting like a terraria

1452
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
i'm really getting like a terraria
 

1453
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,269

feeling for this area i want to sort of
 

1457
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,669
feeling for this area i want to sort of
develop that as the theme so for for

1458
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
develop that as the theme so for for
 

1459
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,230
develop that as the theme so for for
example imagine we set up a honey farm

1460
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
example imagine we set up a honey farm
 

1461
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,830
example imagine we set up a honey farm
like a bees nest or something

1462
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
like a bees nest or something
 

1463
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,350
like a bees nest or something
representing the

1464
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
representing the
 

1465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,029
representing the
the bee fighting terraria right but

1466
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
the bee fighting terraria right but
 

1467
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,630
the bee fighting terraria right but
instead of like having these pools of

1468
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
instead of like having these pools of
 

1469
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,110
instead of like having these pools of
water we replace the water with honey

1470
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
water we replace the water with honey
 

1471
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,269
water we replace the water with honey
maybe and then like the clay with

1472
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
maybe and then like the clay with
 

1473
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,430
maybe and then like the clay with
honeycomb i think that could look cool

1474
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
honeycomb i think that could look cool
 

1475
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,029
honeycomb i think that could look cool
have it like dripping from the b nest

have it like dripping from the b nest
 

1477
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,070
have it like dripping from the b nest
and then

1478
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
and then
 

1479
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,510
and then
inside is where all the bees are and

1480
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
inside is where all the bees are and

want to try pull some of the elements

1484
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
want to try pull some of the elements
 

1485
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,149
want to try pull some of the elements
from terraria and use them as our

1486
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
from terraria and use them as our
 

1487
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,549
from terraria and use them as our
decoration ideas for down here

1488
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
decoration ideas for down here
 

1489
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,870
decoration ideas for down here
so for example as well like you could

1490
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
so for example as well like you could
 

1491
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,789
so for example as well like you could
put heart containers in places you know

1492
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
put heart containers in places you know
 

1493
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,630
put heart containers in places you know
those those rooms with the treasure

1494
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
those those rooms with the treasure
 

1495
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,390
those those rooms with the treasure
chests in we could use

1496
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
chests in we could use
 

1497
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,149
chests in we could use
that as like some buildings for down

1498
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
that as like some buildings for down
 

1499
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,470
that as like some buildings for down
here and i want to put like a couple

1500
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
here and i want to put like a couple
 

1501

1507
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,909
a couple of random plantera bulbs down
here

1508
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
here
 

1509
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,269
here
as well i think that could look cool add

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
some pink to the train i think that
 

1513
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,630
some pink to the train i think that
would look nice

1514

would look nice
 

1515
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,590
would look nice
uh

1516
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
uh
 

1517
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,630
uh
let's space this a bit more

1518
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
let's space this a bit more
 

1519
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,990
let's space this a bit more
actually

1520
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
actually
 

1521
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,230
actually
this is gonna be a big bulb isn't it

1522
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
this is gonna be a big bulb isn't it
 

1523
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,909
this is gonna be a big bulb isn't it
that's good we want like big elements

1524
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
that's good we want like big elements
 

1525
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,350
that's good we want like big elements
though right we don't want everything so

1526
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
though right we don't want everything so
 

1527
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,750
though right we don't want everything so
small it needs to be like oh that i i

1528
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
small it needs to be like oh that i i
 

1529
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,269
small it needs to be like oh that i i
know what that is it's a plantarity bulb

1530
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
know what that is it's a plantarity bulb
 

1531
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,269
know what that is it's a plantarity bulb
when you look at it kind of thing

1532
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
when you look at it kind of thing
 

1533
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,390
when you look at it kind of thing
uh

1534
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
uh
 

1535
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,390
uh
let's round that out

1536
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
let's round that out
 

1537
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,390
let's round that out
and i'm gonna fill this in with the pink

1538
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
and i'm gonna fill this in with the pink
 

1539
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,190
and i'm gonna fill this in with the pink
terracotta

1540
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200

 

1541
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,269

and hopefully this looks cool we

1542
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
and hopefully this looks cool we
 

1543
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,549
and hopefully this looks cool we
probably gotta rough this up a bit more

1544
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
probably gotta rough this up a bit more
 

1545
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,310
probably gotta rough this up a bit more
and then

1546
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320

 

1547
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,590

uh let's go up more

1548
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
uh let's go up more
 

1549
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,950
uh let's go up more
yeah let's go up one more and then we'll

1550
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
yeah let's go up one more and then we'll
 

1551
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,830
yeah let's go up one more and then we'll
do the

1552
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
do the
 

1553
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,390
do the
we'll bring it in a bit

1554
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
we'll bring it in a bit
 

1555
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,149
we'll bring it in a bit
how's that looking let's take a let's

1556
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
how's that looking let's take a let's
 

1557
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,990
how's that looking let's take a let's
take a step back

1558
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000

 

1559
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,029

huh

1560
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
huh
 

1561
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,350
huh
that's not bad right

1562
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
that's not bad right
 

1563
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,950
that's not bad right
oh we could do something like that maybe

1564
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
oh we could do something like that maybe
 

1565
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,789
oh we could do something like that maybe

it actually goes to a pretty good spot
 

1761
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,389
it actually goes to a pretty good spot
in the man cave and we could probably

1762
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
in the man cave and we could probably
 

1763
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,070
in the man cave and we could probably
put an elevator to connect the two

1764
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
put an elevator to connect the two
 

1765
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,430
put an elevator to connect the two
together because right now there's no

1766
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
together because right now there's no
 

1767
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,029
together because right now there's no

1819
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,950
get a couple stripes of clay here
just a couple of minutes of building

1820
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
just a couple of minutes of building
 

1821
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,950
just a couple of minutes of building
makes such a big difference it's crazy

1822
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
makes such a big difference it's crazy
 

1823

um what i want to do now is like we got
 

1827
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,990
um what i want to do now is like we got
this tiny area here like it feels like

1828
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
this tiny area here like it feels like
 

1829
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,269
this tiny area here like it feels like
it's big enough i need to do something

1830
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
it's big enough i need to do something
 

1831
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,269
it's big enough i need to do something
with it but it's too small to really do

1832
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
with it but it's too small to really do
 

1833
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,350
with it but it's too small to really do
anything substantial so we might just

1834
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
anything substantial so we might just
 

1835
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,789
anything substantial so we might just
build another one of these

1836
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
build another one of these
 

1837
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,230

yellow for this one let me figure out

1878
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
yellow for this one let me figure out
 

1879
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,350
yellow for this one let me figure out
the shape of this thing before i

1880
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
the shape of this thing before i
 

1881
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,710
the shape of this thing before i
actually start putting the wool down

1883
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,149

maybe like that well i guess it should

1884
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,159
maybe like that well i guess it should
 

1885
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,470
maybe like that well i guess it should
match the counter right yeah

1886
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480

 

1887
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,389

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,909
i don't know what i was thinking
not my proudest moment okay uh we got a

2002
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
not my proudest moment okay uh we got a
 

2003
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,830
not my proudest moment okay uh we got a
little bit of a space here not really

2004
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
little bit of a space here not really
 

2005
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,430
little bit of a space here not really
enough space for a house i don't think

2006
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
enough space for a house i don't think
 

2007
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,509
enough space for a house i don't think
so we got to put something here that's

2008
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
so we got to put something here that's
 

2009
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,269
so we got to put something here that's
kind of small

2010
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279
kind of small
 

2011
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,350

area and it makes sense i think they
 

2017
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,470
area and it makes sense i think they
would come up to the well to drink right

2099
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,790
it out i've been building a way here and
we now have a brand new building

2100
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
we now have a brand new building
 

2101
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,870
we now have a brand new building
added to sandy city

2102
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
added to sandy city
 

2103
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,870
added to sandy city
it's a two story

2104
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:50,880
it's a two story
 

2105
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,550
it's a two story
uh let's see let's get a couple

2106
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
uh let's see let's get a couple
 

2107
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,030
uh let's see let's get a couple
different angles of it so it's kind of

2108
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
different angles of it so it's kind of
 

2109
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,750
different angles of it so it's kind of
like a fat t-shaped building

2110
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:57,760
like a fat t-shaped building
 

2111
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,510
like a fat t-shaped building
both on the bottom and the top it's like

2112
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
both on the bottom and the top it's like
 

2113
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,910
both on the bottom and the top it's like
another tee stacked on top of a a bigger

2114
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
another tee stacked on top of a a bigger
 

2115
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,030
another tee stacked on top of a a bigger
t below

2116
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
t below
 

2117
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,030
t below
and i think it works i think it's good

2118
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
and i think it works i think it's good
 

2119
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,109
and i think it works i think it's good
so i didn't do the interior i got a lot

2120
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:07,119
so i didn't do the interior i got a lot
 

2121
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,710
so i didn't do the interior i got a lot
of buildings i need to add interiors to

2122
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
of buildings i need to add interiors to
 

2123
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,470
of buildings i need to add interiors to
and i'll probably make a episode where i

2124
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
and i'll probably make a episode where i
 

2125
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,190
and i'll probably make a episode where i
focus on that um but my plan with this

2126
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
focus on that um but my plan with this
 

2127
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,109
focus on that um but my plan with this
one is i'm gonna use these barrels to

2128
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
one is i'm gonna use these barrels to
 

2129
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,270
one is i'm gonna use these barrels to
store dyes in i think because i don't

2130
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
store dyes in i think because i don't
 

2131
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,190
store dyes in i think because i don't
really have a good uh like bulk dye

2132
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
really have a good uh like bulk dye

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,750
run around looking for little scraps
here and there it's kind of annoying

2138
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:25,760
here and there it's kind of annoying
 

2139
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,069
here and there it's kind of annoying
so i want like a big storage spot for it

2140
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
so i want like a big storage spot for it
 

2141
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,829
so i want like a big storage spot for it
um and then

2142
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
um and then
 

2143
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,829
um and then
the thing is with that little t on the

2144
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
the thing is with that little t on the
 

2145
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,349
the thing is with that little t on the
top of the building there wasn't really

2146
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
top of the building there wasn't really
 

2147
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,790

2159
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,230
real way to get up on the wall so now we
have a way
