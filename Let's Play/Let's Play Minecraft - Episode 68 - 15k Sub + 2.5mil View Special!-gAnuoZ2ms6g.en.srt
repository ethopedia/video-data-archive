25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,340
50/50 again so I think more people
prefer the sandstone it's over the logs

26
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,350

but it was really close and I did too so
 

29
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,760
but it was really close and I did too so
that's why I went with sandstone didn't

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:01,770
that's why I went with sandstone didn't
 

31
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,820
that's why I went with sandstone didn't
do the lining though around the door I

bunch of glowstone again it's so much
 

53
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,010
bunch of glowstone again it's so much
easier to collect it now so the good

easier to collect it now so the good
 

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,620
easier to collect it now so the good
news is I can actually see in my storage

56

news is I can actually see in my storage
 

57
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,179

room once again better than before even

58
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:58,189
room once again better than before even
 

59
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,910

another good thing is I can very clearly

60
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
another good thing is I can very clearly
 

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,389
another good thing is I can very clearly
read the signs now so you can't get them

62
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
read the signs now so you can't get them
 

63
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,270
read the signs now so you can't get them
any brighter than that so

64
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
any brighter than that so
 

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,580
any brighter than that so
even brighter than having the torches

66
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,590
even brighter than having the torches
 

67
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,640
even brighter than having the torches

kind of not really make myself boats

96
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,110
kind of not really make myself boats
 

97
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,740
kind of not really make myself boats
well let's do two and apparently that

98
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:19,750
well let's do two and apparently that

quick water elevator now so I might

102
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,030
quick water elevator now so I might
 

103
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,330
quick water elevator now so I might
experiment with that then eats as you

104
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,340
experiment with that then eats as you
 

105
00:03:30,340 --> 00:04:14,690

probably saw in docked in 1767

106
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:14,700

 

107
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,130

and that's where falls apart I have both

108
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,140
and that's where falls apart I have both
 

109
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,900
and that's where falls apart I have both
bullets don't let oh yeah I'm gonna do

110
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:21,910
bullets don't let oh yeah I'm gonna do
 

111
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,220

this one more time because that was kind

112
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,230
this one more time because that was kind
 

113
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,430
this one more time because that was kind
of crummy all right

114
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,440
of crummy all right
 

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,830

second attempt here ignore these first

116
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
second attempt here ignore these first
 

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:59,580
second attempt here ignore these first
few notes and here we go okay so that is

118
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,590
few notes and here we go okay so that is

supposed to be the intro to the cave

120
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,230
supposed to be the intro to the cave

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,210
supposed to be the intro to the cave
story theme song someone gets that with

122
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,220
story theme song someone gets that with
 

123
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,600

only four notes last episode don't know

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,610
only four notes last episode don't know
 

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,030
only four notes last episode don't know
how how he did that that's incredible

126
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,040
how how he did that that's incredible
 

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,130
how how he did that that's incredible
but the problem with doing this music

128
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,140
but the problem with doing this music

with the e throat is timing for each of

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
with the e throat is timing for each of
 

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,500
with the e throat is timing for each of
these things is equal but if you try to

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,510
these things is equal but if you try to
 

133
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,070
these things is equal but if you try to
add repeaters on to these pressure

134
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
add repeaters on to these pressure
 

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,260
add repeaters on to these pressure
plates or any type of delay using

redstone it doesn't work because it's

138
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,220
redstone it doesn't work because it's
 

139
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,090
redstone it doesn't work because it's
time different so you can't get equal

140
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,100
time different so you can't get equal
 

141
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,280
time different so you can't get equal
notes

142
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,290

 

143
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,280

if that makes sense I'll show you what I

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,290
if that makes sense I'll show you what I
 

145
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,020
if that makes sense I'll show you what I
mean okay so that plays two notes going

146
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,030
mean okay so that plays two notes going
 

147
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:57,040
mean okay so that plays two notes going
over that one pressure plate and this is

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,050
over that one pressure plate and this is
 

149
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:05,230
over that one pressure plate and this is
what it looks like inside here it goes

150
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,240
what it looks like inside here it goes
 

151
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,310
what it looks like inside here it goes
to that one then there's a two torch

152
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,320
to that one then there's a two torch
 

153
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,730
to that one then there's a two torch
delay and then it goes to this one so

154
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:12,740
delay and then it goes to this one so
 

155
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,760
delay and then it goes to this one so
you can't time it using the e throat and

156
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:15,770
you can't time it using the e throat and
 

157
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,530
you can't time it using the e throat and
then have like a repeater like I have

158
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:17,540
then have like a repeater like I have
 

159
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,790
then have like a repeater like I have
here and expect to hit the timing right

160
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
here and expect to hit the timing right
 

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,030
here and expect to hit the timing right
so I'll probably just remove that

162
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,040
so I'll probably just remove that
 

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,890
so I'll probably just remove that
jumbled part of the song

164
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:26,900
jumbled part of the song
 

165
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,790
jumbled part of the song
and just keep that intro the way I could

166
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:33,800
and just keep that intro the way I could
 

167
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:45,690
and just keep that intro the way I could
get this to work is to let's see

168
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:45,700

 

169
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,910

I would have to shorten these streams to

170
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:50,920
I would have to shorten these streams to
 

171
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,250
I would have to shorten these streams to
only too long so that it's a repeated

172
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,260
only too long so that it's a repeated
 

173
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:03,530
only too long so that it's a repeated
pattern every three blocks and then I

174
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,540

 

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,780

would be able to space the song properly

176
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:06,790
would be able to space the song properly
 

177
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,880
would be able to space the song properly
it's other thing is it playing a little

178
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:08,890
it's other thing is it playing a little
 

179
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,550
it's other thing is it playing a little
bit slow the tempo so it would be better

180
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:11,560
bit slow the tempo so it would be better
 

181
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,910
bit slow the tempo so it would be better
if it was only like that instead so I

182
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:17,920
if it was only like that instead so I
 

183
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,460
if it was only like that instead so I
would increase the tempo to do the

184
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:20,470
would increase the tempo to do the
 

185
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,490
would increase the tempo to do the
proper speed of the song and also I

186
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,500
proper speed of the song and also I
 

187
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,570
proper speed of the song and also I
would be able to time it properly using

188
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:29,580
would be able to time it properly using
 

189
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,300
would be able to time it properly using
pressure plates instead of redstone

190
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,310
pressure plates instead of redstone
 

191
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,650
pressure plates instead of redstone
repeaters and stuff but anyway I'm sure

192
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:37,660
repeaters and stuff but anyway I'm sure
 

193
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,060
repeaters and stuff but anyway I'm sure
you're getting bored with this already

194
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,070

 

195
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,240

people have very short attention spans

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,250
people have very short attention spans
 

197
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,050
people have very short attention spans

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,280
done that at that ends guessing this is
where I will probably end the road and I

202
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,290
where I will probably end the road and I
 

203
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,310
where I will probably end the road and I
might have more Road segments around

204
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,320
might have more Road segments around
 

205
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,370
might have more Road segments around
here I don't know but that's it for eats

206
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,380
here I don't know but that's it for eats
 

207

so far it's working progress so

208
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:09,850
so far it's working progress so

something I was hoping to fix this

210
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:11,830
something I was hoping to fix this
 

211
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,910
something I was hoping to fix this
episode is this minecart system as well

I already went ahead and fixed the

214
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,130
I already went ahead and fixed the
 

215
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,220
I already went ahead and fixed the
wiring which was washed away and I think

216
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,230
wiring which was washed away and I think
 

217
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,570
wiring which was washed away and I think
I made it so that won't happen again

218
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,580
I made it so that won't happen again
 

219
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,620
I made it so that won't happen again
so someone op op op op op op op op 31 or

how to fix this it looked really simple

224
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
how to fix this it looked really simple
 

225
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,690
how to fix this it looked really simple
I just need to place some trapdoors here

226
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700

 

227
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,810

pretty much

228
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:46,820
pretty much

I couldn't find his video again so I'm

230
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,370
I couldn't find his video again so I'm
 

231
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:57,730
I couldn't find his video again so I'm
going off of memory and I got two

00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:57,740
going off of memory and I got two
 

233

trapdoors can't place these on glass

234
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,310
trapdoors can't place these on glass
 

235
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,640
trapdoors can't place these on glass
apparently

236
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,650

I'm guessing a pair of squirrel and

238
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:05,950
I'm guessing a pair of squirrel and
 

239
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm guessing a pair of squirrel and
Ralph David also have videos on how to

240
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,110
Ralph David also have videos on how to
 

241
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,360
Ralph David also have videos on how to
do this which I will be checking if I

242
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,370
do this which I will be checking if I
 

243
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:26,350
do this which I will be checking if I
get stuck here and just I'm assuming

244
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,360
get stuck here and just I'm assuming
 

245
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,940
get stuck here and just I'm assuming
this is that I haven't really put a lot

246
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:27,950
this is that I haven't really put a lot
 

247
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,500
this is that I haven't really put a lot
of thought into this to trap doors and

248
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,510
of thought into this to trap doors and
 

249
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:44,190
of thought into this to trap doors and
then I'm guessing power rail here and

250
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,200

 

251
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,430

rail here and now what I think I have to

252
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
rail here and now what I think I have to
 

253
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,620
rail here and now what I think I have to
do but I'm not certain as you see that

254
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:53,630
do but I'm not certain as you see that
 

255
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,200
do but I'm not certain as you see that
power down there right now that's

256
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,210
power down there right now that's
 

257
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,280
power down there right now that's
powering well what's powering that cart

258
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,290
powering well what's powering that cart
 

259
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,640
powering well what's powering that cart
there this power rail I need to run that

260
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:03,650
there this power rail I need to run that
 

261
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,090
there this power rail I need to run that
wire all the way to these trapdoors and

262
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,100
wire all the way to these trapdoors and
 

263
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,860
wire all the way to these trapdoors and
hopefully that will make this work and

264
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:13,870
hopefully that will make this work and
 

265
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,850
hopefully that will make this work and
once again I haven't put much thought

266
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:15,860
once again I haven't put much thought
 

267
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,650
once again I haven't put much thought
into this so there's a good chance it

268
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:17,660
into this so there's a good chance it
 

269
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:27,010
into this so there's a good chance it
won't work I'd opened one mmm there's

270
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,020
won't work I'd opened one mmm there's
 

271
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,980
won't work I'd opened one mmm there's
probably a trick to make them open both

272
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:28,990
probably a trick to make them open both
 

273
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,800
probably a trick to make them open both
really easily

274
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:35,810

 

275
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,150

oh I hate destroying this tract it was

276
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
oh I hate destroying this tract it was
 

277
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:49,869
oh I hate destroying this tract it was
so hard to make this but it doesn't work

278
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:49,879
so hard to make this but it doesn't work
 

279
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,230
so hard to make this but it doesn't work
so there's no point keeping it around

280
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
so there's no point keeping it around
 

281
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,679
so there's no point keeping it around
oops and I should probably keep the

282
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:58,689
oops and I should probably keep the
 

283
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,650
oops and I should probably keep the
delay because I don't want to disturb

284
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,660
delay because I don't want to disturb
 

285
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,639
delay because I don't want to disturb
those repeaters if possible that maybe

286
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:06,649
those repeaters if possible that maybe
 

287
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,749
those repeaters if possible that maybe
we'll run it up no there's something up

288
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:10,759
we'll run it up no there's something up
 

289
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:19,119
we'll run it up no there's something up
there going to place its like this or on

290
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,129
there going to place its like this or on
 

291
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:32,410
there going to place its like this or on
a stair chase up there's a reason I

292
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,420
a stair chase up there's a reason I
 

293
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,400
a stair chase up there's a reason I
never do wiring on camera because it

294
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,410
never do wiring on camera because it
 

295
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,170

you're always redoing everything or at

296
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,180
you're always redoing everything or at
 

297
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,240
you're always redoing everything or at
least I always have to redo stuff I do

298
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,250

 

299
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,299

ok this can probably just wrap around

300
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:51,309

 

301
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:56,460

like so

302
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,470

 

303
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:05,850

and just like that

304
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:05,860

 

305
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,310

okay that was pretty good now we just

306
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,320
okay that was pretty good now we just
 

307
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,370
okay that was pretty good now we just
need to open the other one as well how

308
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,380
need to open the other one as well how
 

309
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,460
need to open the other one as well how
should I do that problem is that wire is

310
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,470
should I do that problem is that wire is
 

311
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,680
should I do that problem is that wire is
in the way and this is probably pretty

312
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:29,690
in the way and this is probably pretty
 

313
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,830
in the way and this is probably pretty
messy looking but it's a fixed so it's

314
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:35,840
messy looking but it's a fixed so it's
 

315
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,340
messy looking but it's a fixed so it's
not oh I just fell through the ground

316
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,350
not oh I just fell through the ground
 

317
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,650
not oh I just fell through the ground
guys that glitch is still in the I just

318
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:44,660
guys that glitch is still in the I just
 

319
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,430
guys that glitch is still in the I just
fell through the ground again that still

320
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,440
fell through the ground again that still
 

321
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,750
fell through the ground again that still
needs to be fixed happens when you walk

322
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:52,760
needs to be fixed happens when you walk
 

323
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,030
needs to be fixed happens when you walk
over repeaters and I think this ceiling

324
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
over repeaters and I think this ceiling
 

325
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,610
over repeaters and I think this ceiling
is only two I let's try it out now we

326
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:00,620
is only two I let's try it out now we
 

327
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:09,960
is only two I let's try it out now we
want them both to open at the same time

328
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:09,970

 

329
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:19,200

so that should be pretty good yeah okay

330
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,210
so that should be pretty good yeah okay
 

331
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,450
so that should be pretty good yeah okay
so I'm gonna finish this up and see what

332
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,460
so I'm gonna finish this up and see what
 

333
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:29,590
so I'm gonna finish this up and see what
happens okay here's the first test I got

334
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
happens okay here's the first test I got
 

335
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,480
happens okay here's the first test I got
rid of the one power rail here replaced

336
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,490
rid of the one power rail here replaced
 

337
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,300
rid of the one power rail here replaced
it with a regular rail I powered this

338
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,310
it with a regular rail I powered this
 

339
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,240
it with a regular rail I powered this
one using a lever which I'll probably

340
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,250
one using a lever which I'll probably
 

341
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,870
one using a lever which I'll probably
change later and I put a detector rail

342
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
change later and I put a detector rail
 

343
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,740
change later and I put a detector rail
here to cause the looping action to take

344
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:44,750
here to cause the looping action to take
 

345
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,090
here to cause the looping action to take
place and I don't really remember how

346
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,100
place and I don't really remember how
 

347
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,190
place and I don't really remember how
this all works down here is a problem I

348
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,200
this all works down here is a problem I
 

349
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,620
this all works down here is a problem I
kind of waited a long time before fixing

350
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:53,630
kind of waited a long time before fixing
 

351
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,680
kind of waited a long time before fixing
this so let's just see what happens here

352
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:58,690
this so let's just see what happens here
 

353
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,400
this so let's just see what happens here
should drop it down one all right it

354
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,410
should drop it down one all right it
 

355
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,940
should drop it down one all right it
snaps to the bottom

356
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:06,950

 

357
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,920

and that's not moving I think that has

358
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:09,930
and that's not moving I think that has
 

359
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,580
and that's not moving I think that has
to be a different block than glass yep

360
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,590
to be a different block than glass yep
 

361
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:26,090
to be a different block than glass yep
looks like I need more paddles but it's

362
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100
looks like I need more paddles but it's
 

363
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,630
looks like I need more paddles but it's
gone

364
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:26,640
gone
 

365
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:38,180
gone
oh but you know what that's kind of

366
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,190
oh but you know what that's kind of
 

367
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:47,680
oh but you know what that's kind of
shorten my stack a lot that's not good

368
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:47,690

 

369
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,920

power rail here and so this isn't gonna

370
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:51,930
power rail here and so this isn't gonna
 

371
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,050
power rail here and so this isn't gonna
loop because there were no carts here

372
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,060
loop because there were no carts here
 

373
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,630
loop because there were no carts here
when the trap doors opened on that last

374
00:14:59,630 --> 00:14:59,640
when the trap doors opened on that last
 

375
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,320
when the trap doors opened on that last
time so for this to keep looping this

376
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,330
time so for this to keep looping this
 

377
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,540
time so for this to keep looping this
always has to be always has to have at

378
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,550
always has to be always has to have at
 

379
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:22,490
always has to be always has to have at
least one in it but overall it seems to

380
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,500
least one in it but overall it seems to
 

381
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,050
least one in it but overall it seems to
be working okay I just need to fill it

382
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,060
be working okay I just need to fill it
 

383
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,020
be working okay I just need to fill it
all the way up and get the heck out of

384
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,030
all the way up and get the heck out of
 

385
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,880
all the way up and get the heck out of
here you loser how did you get in here

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:34,890
here you loser how did you get in here
 

387
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:46,490
here you loser how did you get in here
you oh yeah okay so this thing's full

388
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:46,500
you oh yeah okay so this thing's full
 

389
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,950
you oh yeah okay so this thing's full
now it's holding one two three four five

390
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:51,960
now it's holding one two three four five
 

391
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,320
now it's holding one two three four five
six seven eight carts used to hold ten

392
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,330
six seven eight carts used to hold ten
 

393
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,970
six seven eight carts used to hold ten
so that should be enough still cuz I had

394
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:58,980
so that should be enough still cuz I had
 

395
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,250
so that should be enough still cuz I had
too many before anyway if I need it to

396
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,260
too many before anyway if I need it to
 

397
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,580
too many before anyway if I need it to
hold more I tend just lower this thing

398
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:07,590
hold more I tend just lower this thing
 

399
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,690
hold more I tend just lower this thing
which actually wouldn't be a bad idea

400
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:08,700
which actually wouldn't be a bad idea
 

401
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,570
which actually wouldn't be a bad idea
because I had to run this wiring up

402
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:11,580
because I had to run this wiring up
 

403
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:18,120
because I had to run this wiring up
quite a few blocks and

404
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,130

 

405
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,520

should be all virgin okay down here I

406
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,530
should be all virgin okay down here I
 

407
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,310
should be all virgin okay down here I
want to try out my controls in the

408
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,320
want to try out my controls in the
 

409
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,630
want to try out my controls in the
control room to see if they work

410
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:26,640
control room to see if they work
 

411
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,740
control room to see if they work
technically this should be better now

412
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,750
technically this should be better now
 

413
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,090
technically this should be better now
because before every odd time it would

414
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,100
because before every odd time it would
 

415
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,060
because before every odd time it would
just stop working because it would get

416
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,070
just stop working because it would get
 

417
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,340
just stop working because it would get
an inconsistent boost using the old

418
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,350
an inconsistent boost using the old
 

419
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,870
an inconsistent boost using the old
booster glitch and when it quite go far

420
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
booster glitch and when it quite go far
 

421
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,660
booster glitch and when it quite go far
enough and it would stall out so let's

422
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:45,670
enough and it would stall out so let's
 

423
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,900
enough and it would stall out so let's
just see what happens this has to be on

424
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:50,910
just see what happens this has to be on
 

425
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,950
just see what happens this has to be on
startup but our hot and cold thing is

426
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:55,960
startup but our hot and cold thing is
 

427
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,400
startup but our hot and cold thing is
not going to work anymore and this is

428
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,410
not going to work anymore and this is
 

429
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,210
not going to work anymore and this is
our delay so a button pressure had

430
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,220
our delay so a button pressure had
 

431
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:14,289
our delay so a button pressure had
always started now I'm guessing

432
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:14,299

 

433
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,819

just one downside of this now is you're

434
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:16,829
just one downside of this now is you're
 

435
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:25,970
just one downside of this now is you're
gonna have that constant noise but it's

436
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:25,980
gonna have that constant noise but it's
 

437
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:33,350
gonna have that constant noise but it's
working but am i game sure legs with

438
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
working but am i game sure legs with
 

439
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,940
working but am i game sure legs with
that thing with the timer is running

440
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:36,950
that thing with the timer is running
 

441
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,440
that thing with the timer is running
guided me hanging 30 frames per second

442
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,450
guided me hanging 30 frames per second
 

443
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:57,909
guided me hanging 30 frames per second
now oh yes I filled that in Wow

444
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919

 

445
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,680

so that's me there's no problem keeping

446
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:00,690
so that's me there's no problem keeping
 

447
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,609
so that's me there's no problem keeping
up there's it always at least three in

448
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:03,619
up there's it always at least three in
 

449
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,279
up there's it always at least three in
and it shouldn't stall out like it was

450
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:06,289
and it shouldn't stall out like it was
 

451
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,999
and it shouldn't stall out like it was
originally so all in all this is a lot

452
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,009
originally so all in all this is a lot
 

453
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:16,009
originally so all in all this is a lot
better now but I don't know if I'll keep

454
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:16,019
better now but I don't know if I'll keep
 

455
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,570
better now but I don't know if I'll keep
this running all the time just because

456
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:17,580
this running all the time just because
 

457
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,970
this running all the time just because
it legs my game a lot especially when

458
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
it legs my game a lot especially when
 

459
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,659
it legs my game a lot especially when
I'm recording well guys I think that's

460
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:26,669
I'm recording well guys I think that's
 

461
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,930
I'm recording well guys I think that's
the end of this episode pretty much did

462
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:29,940
the end of this episode pretty much did
 

463
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,340
the end of this episode pretty much did
everything I wanted to do to show you so

464
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,350
everything I wanted to do to show you so
 

465
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,109
everything I wanted to do to show you so
gonna end it here so I think we pretty

466
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:39,119
gonna end it here so I think we pretty
 

467
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,629
gonna end it here so I think we pretty
much fixed everything that's been broken

468
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:41,639
much fixed everything that's been broken
 

469
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,789
much fixed everything that's been broken
by the recent patches which is pretty

470
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:43,799
by the recent patches which is pretty
 

471
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,210
by the recent patches which is pretty
good the only thing that I think I

472
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,220
good the only thing that I think I
 

473
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,999
good the only thing that I think I
didn't fix is the vertical cannons and I

474
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:50,009
didn't fix is the vertical cannons and I
 

475
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,830
didn't fix is the vertical cannons and I
don't think I can without making them a

476
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
don't think I can without making them a
 

477
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
don't think I can without making them a
lot bigger and I'm not really excited

478
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:54,809
lot bigger and I'm not really excited
 

479
00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:01,070
lot bigger and I'm not really excited
about fixing them so I'll probably come

480
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,080
about fixing them so I'll probably come
 

481
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,160
about fixing them so I'll probably come
up with something else

482
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,170
up with something else
 

483
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,350
up with something else
