00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,320
use redstone to program our pets oh it's
 

207

I'm gonna build them and basically I'm
 

213
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm gonna build them and basically I'm
trying to I haven't done anything with

214
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,750
trying to I haven't done anything with
 

215
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,050
trying to I haven't done anything with
this by the way

216
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,060
this by the way

but I looked online for white and sleep
for the game mechanics behind that and

242
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,470
for the game mechanics behind that and
 

243
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,290
for the game mechanics behind that and
I'm going to try emulate that so I want

244
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm going to try emulate that so I want

for that kind of thing you know I really
 

263
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,910
for that kind of thing you know I really
like about this quartz block by the way

264
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:20,920
like about this quartz block by the way
 

265
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,740
like about this quartz block by the way
you can break it easy look at that so

266

you can break it easy look at that so
 

267
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,350
you can break it easy look at that so
it's good for building temporary things

268
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
it's good for building temporary things
 

269

right face and if we do that reversed we

336
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
right face and if we do that reversed we
 

337
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,590
right face and if we do that reversed we
might have a like a super content with

338
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,600
might have a like a super content with
 

339
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,690
might have a like a super content with
life oh yeah super content with life

340

life oh yeah super content with life
 

341
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,740
life oh yeah super content with life
face let's that's above happy face

342
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:41,750
face let's that's above happy face
 

343
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,720
face let's that's above happy face
alright so we got we got six different

344
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,730
alright so we got we got six different
 

345
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,990
alright so we got we got six different
faces there we have super happy happy

346
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
faces there we have super happy happy
 

347
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,130
faces there we have super happy happy

neutral sad and I I hate you
and then our dead face cool okay I'm

350
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:56,820
and then our dead face cool okay I'm
 

351
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,810
and then our dead face cool okay I'm
happy with that that's a good range so

352
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:01,820

 

353
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,579

what I did here is I just took a moment

354
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:04,589
what I did here is I just took a moment
 

355
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:07,699
what I did here is I just took a moment
just to write a book pet project plan

356
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:07,709
just to write a book pet project plan
 

357
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,190
just to write a book pet project plan
it's a best-seller people love it

358
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
it's a best-seller people love it
 

359
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,010
it's a best-seller people love it
this book here outlines some of my plans

360
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,020
this book here outlines some of my plans
 

361
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,880
this book here outlines some of my plans
for our pet here for our game and how

362
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:16,890
for our pet here for our game and how
 

363
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,949
for our pet here for our game and how
the mechanics are going to work and not

364
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
the mechanics are going to work and not
 

365
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,350
the mechanics are going to work and not
I did this so you guys can see kind of

366
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
I did this so you guys can see kind of
 

367
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,269
I did this so you guys can see kind of
the end goal for this what I'm aiming

368
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
the end goal for this what I'm aiming
 

369
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,000
the end goal for this what I'm aiming
for I haven't built this in creative or

370
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,010
for I haven't built this in creative or
 

371
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,780
for I haven't built this in creative or
anything so your your hand along on the

372
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:29,790
anything so your your hand along on the
 

373
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,490
anything so your your hand along on the
ride with me here we're going to try

374
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,500
ride with me here we're going to try
 

375
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,350
ride with me here we're going to try
figure it out together it's going to be

376
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
figure it out together it's going to be
 

377
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
figure it out together it's going to be
very complicated it's going to take a

378
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,130
very complicated it's going to take a
 

379
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,740
very complicated it's going to take a
bit of time we're not doing it today

380
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:36,750
bit of time we're not doing it today
 

381
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,699
bit of time we're not doing it today
totally but yeah this is what we're

382
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:40,709
totally but yeah this is what we're
 

383
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,030
totally but yeah this is what we're
shooting for so with our pet we want him

384
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
shooting for so with our pet we want him
 

385
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,850
shooting for so with our pet we want him
to have stats he's I found I figured out

386
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:49,860
to have stats he's I found I figured out
 

387
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,690
to have stats he's I found I figured out
I want these

388
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:50,700
I want these
 

389
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,350
I want these
six main stats that yes and the

390
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,360
six main stats that yes and the
 

391
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,270
six main stats that yes and the
mechanics for this by the way again is

392
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,280
mechanics for this by the way again is
 

393
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,010
mechanics for this by the way again is
based off of Tamagotchi I went to the

394
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,020
based off of Tamagotchi I went to the
 

395
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,950
based off of Tamagotchi I went to the
Tamagotchi wiki page and read on it and

396
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:00,960
Tamagotchi wiki page and read on it and
 

397
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
Tamagotchi wiki page and read on it and
I broke it down into these six stats is

398
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:03,690
I broke it down into these six stats is
 

399
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,110
I broke it down into these six stats is
what I think we want our pet to have so

400
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,120
what I think we want our pet to have so
 

401
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,140
what I think we want our pet to have so
he's going to have an age over time well

402
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,150
he's going to have an age over time well
 

403
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,880
he's going to have an age over time well
actually I'm not going into the details

404
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:10,890
actually I'm not going into the details
 

405
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,240
actually I'm not going into the details
just yet age happiness under health wait

406
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,250
just yet age happiness under health wait
 

407
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,050
just yet age happiness under health wait
attention these will define how well our

408
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,060
attention these will define how well our
 

409
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,620
attention these will define how well our
pet is doing okay so like with our face

410
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:21,630
pet is doing okay so like with our face
 

411
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,020
pet is doing okay so like with our face
here this is going to be a direct

412
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,030
here this is going to be a direct
 

413
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,960
here this is going to be a direct
reflection of his happiness level so if

414
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:26,970
reflection of his happiness level so if
 

415
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,050
reflection of his happiness level so if
his happiness level is full he's going

416
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,060
his happiness level is full he's going
 

417
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,390
his happiness level is full he's going
to have this face if it's all the way

418
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:32,400
to have this face if it's all the way
 

419
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,280
to have this face if it's all the way
down he's going to have that I hate you

420
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,290
down he's going to have that I hate you
 

421
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,670
down he's going to have that I hate you
face and if health is all the way down

422
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
face and if health is all the way down
 

423
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,530
face and if health is all the way down
he's going to be dead and he'll have the

424
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:39,540
he's going to be dead and he'll have the
 

425
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,370
he's going to be dead and he'll have the
dead face okay that's that's kind of how

426
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,380
dead face okay that's that's kind of how
 

427
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,050
dead face okay that's that's kind of how
that mechanics going to work and we're

428
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,060
that mechanics going to work and we're
 

429
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,390
that mechanics going to work and we're
going to have stat bars beside his face

430
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:50,400
going to have stat bars beside his face
 

431
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
going to have stat bars beside his face
one for each of these probably the H bar

432
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,290
one for each of these probably the H bar
 

433
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,380
one for each of these probably the H bar
is going to be over top as head here

434
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,390
is going to be over top as head here
 

435
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,620
is going to be over top as head here
we're going to use lamps to show to show

436
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,630
we're going to use lamps to show to show
 

437
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,920
we're going to use lamps to show to show
this information and basically with a

438
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:00,930
this information and basically with a
 

439
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,520
this information and basically with a
game you need like four key components

440
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,530
game you need like four key components
 

441
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,890
game you need like four key components
you need a timer so a game a game timing

442
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:09,900
you need a timer so a game a game timing
 

443
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,520
you need a timer so a game a game timing
that constantly loops and every loop

444
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:13,530
that constantly loops and every loop
 

445
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,750
that constantly loops and every loop
it's it does different calculations and

446
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:16,760
it's it does different calculations and
 

447
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,280
it's it does different calculations and
updates events and causes stuff to

448
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,290
updates events and causes stuff to
 

449
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,040
updates events and causes stuff to
happen in the game right so I just made

450
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,050
happen in the game right so I just made
 

451
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,870
happen in the game right so I just made
a tutorial on the hopper timer that's

452
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:23,880
a tutorial on the hopper timer that's
 

453
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,240
a tutorial on the hopper timer that's
what I'm going to use to do stuff so

454
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,250
what I'm going to use to do stuff so
 

455
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,850
what I'm going to use to do stuff so
like over time

456
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:28,860
like over time
 

457
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,250
like over time
age is going to keep increasing and

458
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,260
age is going to keep increasing and
 

459
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,930
age is going to keep increasing and
we're going to use the timer to do that

460
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
we're going to use the timer to do that
 

461
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,210
we're going to use the timer to do that
for example or hunger is going to

462
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,220
for example or hunger is going to
 

463
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,160
for example or hunger is going to
decrease constantly over time all right

464
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,170
decrease constantly over time all right
 

465
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,350
decrease constantly over time all right
we also need what do we need we need

466
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,360
we also need what do we need we need
 

467
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,230
we also need what do we need we need
logic in the game so we're going to do

468
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
logic in the game so we're going to do
 

469
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
logic in the game so we're going to do
that using redstone we're going to

470
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,250
that using redstone we're going to
 

471
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,860
that using redstone we're going to
connect the different stats together in

472
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,870
connect the different stats together in
 

473
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,130
connect the different stats together in
different ways for our logic and we need

474
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,140
different ways for our logic and we need
 

475
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,690
different ways for our logic and we need
a way for the player to interact with

476
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:56,700
a way for the player to interact with
 

477
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,660
a way for the player to interact with
the game so we're going to have like a

478
00:13:59,660 --> 00:13:59,670
the game so we're going to have like a
 

479
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,060
the game so we're going to have like a
hopper we can throw food in to feed them

480
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,070
hopper we can throw food in to feed them
 

481
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,100
hopper we can throw food in to feed them
stuff like that

482
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,110
stuff like that
 

483
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,769
stuff like that
and importantly here we need variables

484
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:08,779
and importantly here we need variables
 

485
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,980
and importantly here we need variables
each of these stats is a variable and

486
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:11,990
each of these stats is a variable and
 

487
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,319
each of these stats is a variable and
thank you or thanks to the redstone

488
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:15,329
thank you or thanks to the redstone
 

489
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:17,389
thank you or thanks to the redstone
update we can actually do variables in

490
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:17,399
update we can actually do variables in
 

491
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,190
update we can actually do variables in
this game sort of these hoppers are

492
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,200
this game sort of these hoppers are
 

493
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,870
this game sort of these hoppers are
amazing this is like my favorite

494
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:23,880
amazing this is like my favorite
 

495
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,730
amazing this is like my favorite
mechanic in the game right now

496
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:25,740
mechanic in the game right now
 

497
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,280
mechanic in the game right now
when you put two hoppers together you

498
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,290
when you put two hoppers together you
 

499
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,290
when you put two hoppers together you
can do amazing things so I kind of found

500
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,300
can do amazing things so I kind of found
 

501
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,019
can do amazing things so I kind of found
out a way I can do a variable if we do

502
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:33,029
out a way I can do a variable if we do
 

503
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,480
out a way I can do a variable if we do
this and then put a block beside it with

504
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,490
this and then put a block beside it with
 

505
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,610
this and then put a block beside it with
a redstone torch like that we can do

506
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:43,620
a redstone torch like that we can do
 

507
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,259
a redstone torch like that we can do
some pretty cool stuff and then we can

508
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:48,269
some pretty cool stuff and then we can
 

509
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,060
some pretty cool stuff and then we can
control it with redstone like that so

510
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,070
control it with redstone like that so
 

511
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,639
control it with redstone like that so
let's put actually just just a second

512
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:58,649
let's put actually just just a second
 

513
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,470
let's put actually just just a second
here we need comparators I don't have

514
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
here we need comparators I don't have
 

515
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,610
here we need comparators I don't have
comparators I'll be right back all right

516
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:04,620
comparators I'll be right back all right
 

517
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,769
comparators I'll be right back all right
so check this out this is my example of

518
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:06,779
so check this out this is my example of
 

519
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,480
so check this out this is my example of
how you can do a variable in this game

520
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,490
how you can do a variable in this game
 

521
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,780
how you can do a variable in this game
now this block and redstone torch combo

522
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:11,790
now this block and redstone torch combo
 

523
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,210
now this block and redstone torch combo
here is very cool because it allows us

524
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,220
here is very cool because it allows us
 

525
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,269
here is very cool because it allows us
to control which hoppers feeding into

526
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
to control which hoppers feeding into
 

527
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,980
to control which hoppers feeding into
the other one not one of them is always

528
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:18,990
the other one not one of them is always
 

529
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,150
the other one not one of them is always
going to be powered one of them is

530
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
going to be powered one of them is
 

531
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,620
going to be powered one of them is
always going to be unpowered with that

532
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,630
always going to be unpowered with that
 

533
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,410
always going to be unpowered with that
then I also have a lever up here which

534
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:24,420
then I also have a lever up here which
 

535
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,040
then I also have a lever up here which
powers both of them or it like freezes

536
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,050
powers both of them or it like freezes
 

537
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,819
powers both of them or it like freezes
everything if it's powered so if I

538
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:31,829
everything if it's powered so if I
 

539
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,840
everything if it's powered so if I
switch this when it's frozen nothing

540
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:35,850
switch this when it's frozen nothing
 

541
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,569
switch this when it's frozen nothing
happens and what we can do with this

542
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:38,579
happens and what we can do with this
 

543
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,030
happens and what we can do with this
lever is basically control addition and

544
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
lever is basically control addition and
 

545
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,460
lever is basically control addition and
subtraction in our variable so we have

546
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,470
subtraction in our variable so we have
 

547
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,829
subtraction in our variable so we have
64 plus 28 items in here this is just

548
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:48,839
64 plus 28 items in here this is just
 

549
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,269
64 plus 28 items in here this is just
enough to light up five redstone spaces

550
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
enough to light up five redstone spaces
 

551
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,240
enough to light up five redstone spaces
or or five lights here now if we

552
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,250
or or five lights here now if we
 

553
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,069
or or five lights here now if we
unfreeze this nothing happens because

554
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,079
unfreeze this nothing happens because
 

555
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,139
unfreeze this nothing happens because
it's on subtraction right now we could

556
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:03,149
it's on subtraction right now we could
 

557
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:08,060
it's on subtraction right now we could
say if we switch it to addition it's

558
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,070
say if we switch it to addition it's
 

559
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,449
say if we switch it to addition it's
going to start going this way so we can

560
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:11,459
going to start going this way so we can
 

561
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,210
going to start going this way so we can
add or we can subtract from our variable

562
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,220
add or we can subtract from our variable
 

563
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,550
add or we can subtract from our variable
very easily with this and then we can

564
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
very easily with this and then we can
 

565
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
very easily with this and then we can
freeze it

566
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:17,930
freeze it
 

567
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,830
freeze it
so like when an update happens we can

568
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:21,840
so like when an update happens we can
 

569
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,040
so like when an update happens we can
either take away or add to a stat very

570
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,050
either take away or add to a stat very
 

571
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,690
either take away or add to a stat very
easily depending on how long we

572
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:26,700
easily depending on how long we
 

573
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,120
easily depending on how long we
unpowered us and whether we're adding or

574
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,130
unpowered us and whether we're adding or
 

575
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,950
unpowered us and whether we're adding or
subtracting yeah and there's also this

576
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:33,960
subtracting yeah and there's also this
 

577
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,770
subtracting yeah and there's also this
is another cool trick by the way if we

578
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:36,780
is another cool trick by the way if we
 

579
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,680
is another cool trick by the way if we
if we use an item that doesn't stack as

580
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,690
if we use an item that doesn't stack as
 

581
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,940
if we use an item that doesn't stack as
much like ender pearls or eggs we can

582
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:43,950
much like ender pearls or eggs we can
 

583
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,490
much like ender pearls or eggs we can
make go quicker too so we have we have

584
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:46,500
make go quicker too so we have we have
 

585
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,700
make go quicker too so we have we have
like a four times speed mode here oops

586
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:51,710

 

587
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,870

2 2 2 2 2

588
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:53,880
2 2 2 2 2
 

589
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,610
2 2 2 2 2
whoops stuff is still sticking there we

590
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:58,620
whoops stuff is still sticking there we
 

591
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:09,470
whoops stuff is still sticking there we
go how many do we need 1 2 Oh another

592
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,480
go how many do we need 1 2 Oh another
 

593
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,130
go how many do we need 1 2 Oh another
one still another one still we had it

594
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,140
one still another one still we had it
 

595
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,310
one still another one still we had it
right darn it okay so now watch how fast

596
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,320
right darn it okay so now watch how fast
 

597
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,670
right darn it okay so now watch how fast
this changes compared to before pretty

598
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:22,680
this changes compared to before pretty
 

599
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,730
this changes compared to before pretty
fast switch it starts going the other

600
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:25,740
fast switch it starts going the other
 

601
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:35,390
fast switch it starts going the other
way and yeah you get the idea so you see

602
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
way and yeah you get the idea so you see
 

603
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,340
way and yeah you get the idea so you see
where I'm going with this then I think

604
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,350
where I'm going with this then I think
 

605
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,420
where I'm going with this then I think
it's going to be a lot of fun I hope

606
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,430
it's going to be a lot of fun I hope
 

607
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,850
it's going to be a lot of fun I hope
you're excited so let's go back to our

608
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:40,860
you're excited so let's go back to our
 

609
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,220
you're excited so let's go back to our
pet project plan for each of these stats

610
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,230
pet project plan for each of these stats
 

611
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,100
pet project plan for each of these stats
I kind of wrote out a rough little idea

612
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,110
I kind of wrote out a rough little idea
 

613
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,800
I kind of wrote out a rough little idea
of how I want them to interact in the

614
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:48,810
of how I want them to interact in the
 

615
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,950
of how I want them to interact in the
game so age down here every update add a

616
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
game so age down here every update add a
 

617
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,560
game so age down here every update add a
constant amount to age so our pet would

618
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:54,570
constant amount to age so our pet would
 

619
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,200
constant amount to age so our pet would
get older at a constant rates and

620
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,210
get older at a constant rates and
 

621
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,490
get older at a constant rates and
basically if he gets to his full age

622
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:00,500
basically if he gets to his full age
 

623
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,680
basically if he gets to his full age
which will probably be represented by 15

624
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,690
which will probably be represented by 15
 

625
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,340
which will probably be represented by 15
laps then it's like we win we kept them

626
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,350
laps then it's like we win we kept them
 

627
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,200
laps then it's like we win we kept them
alive then under hunger that needs to be

628
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,210
alive then under hunger that needs to be
 

629
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,810
alive then under hunger that needs to be
fed frequently hunger drains at a

630
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
fed frequently hunger drains at a
 

631
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,640
fed frequently hunger drains at a
constant rate so our game clock is going

632
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:16,650
constant rate so our game clock is going
 

633
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,100
constant rate so our game clock is going
to keep draining away the hunger hunger

634
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,110
to keep draining away the hunger hunger
 

635
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,930
to keep draining away the hunger hunger
can be replenished with various meals

636
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:20,940

like a border going around the face that
 

773
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,049
like a border going around the face that
comes out one right yeah we'll need to

comes out one right yeah we'll need to
 

775
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,180
comes out one right yeah we'll need to
get light in here too

776
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,190
get light in here too
 

777
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,440

probably otherwise the face is going to
be really dark hmm do that and then

780
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:39,419
be really dark hmm do that and then
 

781
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,659
be really dark hmm do that and then
maybe one back we'll have our stat bars

782
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:44,669
maybe one back we'll have our stat bars
 

783
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:46,310
maybe one back we'll have our stat bars
and I think I want these to be five

together then two on the other side and
 

797
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,260
together then two on the other side and
then at the very bottom we'll have a way

798
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,270
then at the very bottom we'll have a way
 

799
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,110
then at the very bottom we'll have a way
of interacting with the pet like will

800
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
of interacting with the pet like will
 

801
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,810
of interacting with the pet like will
feed them there I think that'll work out

802
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:23,820
feed them there I think that'll work out
 

803
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,480
feed them there I think that'll work out
good I'm gonna snag the stuff okay

804
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,490
good I'm gonna snag the stuff okay
 

805
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,960
good I'm gonna snag the stuff okay
Oh dead lose one No

806
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:34,970

 

807
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,940

okay okay and a border here should I

808
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:40,950
okay okay and a border here should I
 

809
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,800
okay okay and a border here should I
build it out of quartz guys tell me I

810
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:42,810
build it out of quartz guys tell me I
 

811
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,520
build it out of quartz guys tell me I
love quartz I use it all the time now

812
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,530
love quartz I use it all the time now
 

813
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,680
love quartz I use it all the time now
and I probably will if you don't stop me

814
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:48,690
and I probably will if you don't stop me
 

815
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,920
and I probably will if you don't stop me
so just the warning and then yeah like

816
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:51,930
so just the warning and then yeah like
 

817
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,990
so just the warning and then yeah like
our next our next step bar is going to

818
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
our next our next step bar is going to
 

819
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:05,200
our next our next step bar is going to
be above this one like one block above

820
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,210

 

821
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,880

yeah and then another one above that I

822
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:07,890
yeah and then another one above that I
 

823
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,800
yeah and then another one above that I
think that looked pretty good because we

824
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:09,810
think that looked pretty good because we
 

825
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,220
think that looked pretty good because we
can do that pretty sure yeah because

826
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,230
can do that pretty sure yeah because
 

827
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,740
can do that pretty sure yeah because
this the wiring to light up the lamps is

828
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:15,750
this the wiring to light up the lamps is
 

829
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,070
this the wiring to light up the lamps is
going to be one block in and that will

830
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,080
going to be one block in and that will
 

831
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,680
going to be one block in and that will
be flush with it so that should work out

832
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:23,690

 

833
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,140

and we're going to need how much space

834
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,150
and we're going to need how much space
 

835
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:36,410
and we're going to need how much space
get out there this looks like 1 2 3 4 5

836
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:36,420
get out there this looks like 1 2 3 4 5
 

837
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,670
get out there this looks like 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 times to

838
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:43,680
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 times to
 

839
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,160
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 times to
like 27 probably 27 blocks wide because

840
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,170
like 27 probably 27 blocks wide because
 

841
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,130
like 27 probably 27 blocks wide because
it's an odd number that's a bit of space

842
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,140
it's an odd number that's a bit of space
 

843
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,570
it's an odd number that's a bit of space
and a lot of space in the back for

844
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:53,580
and a lot of space in the back for
 

845
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,700
and a lot of space in the back for
wiring and this will be 3 7 9

846
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:58,710
wiring and this will be 3 7 9
 

847
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,260
wiring and this will be 3 7 9
oh man probably 12 tall 11 or 12 tall

848
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,270
oh man probably 12 tall 11 or 12 tall
 

849
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,760
oh man probably 12 tall 11 or 12 tall
total mmm that's a lot of space okay so

850
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:07,770
total mmm that's a lot of space okay so
 

851
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,860
total mmm that's a lot of space okay so
we've got to find a home for our pets

852
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:09,870
we've got to find a home for our pets
 

853
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,540
we've got to find a home for our pets
where do we want to keep them it should

854
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:11,550
where do we want to keep them it should
 

855
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,900
where do we want to keep them it should
be an area I'm nearby quite often but

856
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:14,910
be an area I'm nearby quite often but
 

857
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,880
be an area I'm nearby quite often but
kind of out of the way mmm where to put

858
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:19,890
kind of out of the way mmm where to put
 

859
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,540
kind of out of the way mmm where to put
our pets where should we put them I've

860
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:23,550
our pets where should we put them I've
 

861
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,760
our pets where should we put them I've
been looking around my area here trying

862
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:25,770
been looking around my area here trying
 

863
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,360
been looking around my area here trying
to figure out the best place for it ah

864
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,370
to figure out the best place for it ah
 

865
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,580
to figure out the best place for it ah
the place I visit the most probably or

866
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,590
the place I visit the most probably or
 

867
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,830
the place I visit the most probably or
where I spend most of time in this cave

868
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
where I spend most of time in this cave
 

869
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,450
where I spend most of time in this cave
is a storage room furnace area so we

870
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:38,460
is a storage room furnace area so we
 

871
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,130
is a storage room furnace area so we
want it kind of close to that because

872
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,140
want it kind of close to that because
 

873
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,630
want it kind of close to that because
I'm probably gonna have some noteblocks

874
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:41,640
I'm probably gonna have some noteblocks
 

875
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,480
I'm probably gonna have some noteblocks
and stuff where he can communicate with

876
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,490
and stuff where he can communicate with
 

877
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,419
and stuff where he can communicate with
us in in some way

878
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:47,429
us in in some way
 

879
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,310
us in in some way
so I want to be within range of that

880
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,320
so I want to be within range of that
 

881
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,370
so I want to be within range of that
hopefully so I didn't hear it crying for

882
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,380
hopefully so I didn't hear it crying for
 

883
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,049
hopefully so I didn't hear it crying for
help or something like that so this

884
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:57,059
help or something like that so this
 

885
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,399
help or something like that so this
would be a good spot for that there's

886
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:58,409
would be a good spot for that there's
 

887
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:02,539
would be a good spot for that there's
also no no other projects if we go keep

888
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:02,549
also no no other projects if we go keep
 

889
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,549
also no no other projects if we go keep
going this way so I'm not going to hit

890
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
going this way so I'm not going to hit
 

891
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,470
going this way so I'm not going to hit
anything that's going to get in the way

892
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
anything that's going to get in the way
 

893
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,409
anything that's going to get in the way
I would have to hollow out a bunch of

894
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:09,419
I would have to hollow out a bunch of
 

895
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,879
I would have to hollow out a bunch of
land here though this isn't exactly

896
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:10,889
land here though this isn't exactly
 

897
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:16,759
land here though this isn't exactly
shaped right so that's one idea put it

898
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:16,769
shaped right so that's one idea put it
 

899
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:17,620
shaped right so that's one idea put it
there

900
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:17,630
there
 

901
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,659
there
maybe put it back here somehow but I

902
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:23,669
maybe put it back here somehow but I
 

903
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:29,269
maybe put it back here somehow but I
think trying to think if that would hit

904
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
think trying to think if that would hit
 

905
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,440
think trying to think if that would hit
anything I don't think I have anything

906
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,450
anything I don't think I have anything
 

907
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,999
anything I don't think I have anything
there either so that could be a

908
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:32,009
there either so that could be a
 

909
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,200
there either so that could be a
possibility although the mushroom farm

910
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,210
possibility although the mushroom farm
 

911
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:43,759
possibility although the mushroom farm
that's there yeah if we keep going might

912
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:43,769
that's there yeah if we keep going might
 

913
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:46,369
that's there yeah if we keep going might
hit that somehow the other idea is we

914
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:46,379
hit that somehow the other idea is we
 

915
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,110
hit that somehow the other idea is we
could put it over here somewhere

916
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,120
could put it over here somewhere
 

917
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,240
could put it over here somewhere
definitely wouldn't hit anything and

918
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,250
definitely wouldn't hit anything and
 

919
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,730
definitely wouldn't hit anything and
there's a lot of space kind of figured

920
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:52,740
there's a lot of space kind of figured
 

921
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,590
there's a lot of space kind of figured
out already like opened up Hey

922
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:56,600
out already like opened up Hey
 

923
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,749
out already like opened up Hey
but this is probably too far away to

924
00:25:59,749 --> 00:25:59,759
but this is probably too far away to
 

925
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,810
but this is probably too far away to
hear noteblocks and same with tree farm

926
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:02,820
hear noteblocks and same with tree farm
 

927
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,169
hear noteblocks and same with tree farm
area I think that's too far away so I

928
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:06,179
area I think that's too far away so I
 

929
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,060
area I think that's too far away so I
think we're going to put it up over here

930
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,070
think we're going to put it up over here
 

931
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,899
think we're going to put it up over here
would be best all right so we got our

932
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:14,909
would be best all right so we got our
 

933
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,090
would be best all right so we got our
plan for our pets we're not actually

934
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,100
plan for our pets we're not actually
 

935
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,230
plan for our pets we're not actually
going to get to building it today

936
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
going to get to building it today
 

937
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,419
going to get to building it today
unfortunately I did wasted too much time

938
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:20,429
unfortunately I did wasted too much time
 

939
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:26,509
unfortunately I did wasted too much time
talking but I will work on it and then

940
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:26,519
talking but I will work on it and then
 

941
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,889
talking but I will work on it and then
I'll bring you guys in when we start

942
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:27,899
I'll bring you guys in when we start
 

943
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,139
I'll bring you guys in when we start
moving further with the plan so I'm

944
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:30,149
moving further with the plan so I'm
 

945
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:31,909
moving further with the plan so I'm
going to build the interface and then

946
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
going to build the interface and then
 

947
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,279
going to build the interface and then
we'll start putting stuff together um I

948
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:36,289
we'll start putting stuff together um I
 

949
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,299
we'll start putting stuff together um I
think it's going to turn out pretty good

950
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:38,309
think it's going to turn out pretty good
 

951
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:41,810
think it's going to turn out pretty good
though I'm hoping I might it might be a

952
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:41,820
