again
for a new row of trees

a lot of a lot of blocks to take out
 

115
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,510
a lot of a lot of blocks to take out
this is probably as wide as i'm going to

116
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
this is probably as wide as i'm going to
 

117
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,750
this is probably as wide as i'm going to
do the tree farm though

118
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
do the tree farm though
 

119
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,509
do the tree farm though
if if it needs to be bigger i'll

120
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
if if it needs to be bigger i'll
 

121
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,509
if if it needs to be bigger i'll
probably extend it that way

122
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
probably extend it that way
 

123
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,550
probably extend it that way
but this is probably as wide as it's

124
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
but this is probably as wide as it's
 

125
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,630
but this is probably as wide as it's
going to get because we have

126
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
going to get because we have
 

127
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,910
going to get because we have
40 trees per row here so 40 80

128
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920

 

129
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,670

00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
around my world too
 

175
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,070
around my world too
it's a it's a nice look

176
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
it's a it's a nice look
 

177
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,710
it's a it's a nice look
i was thinking probably won't put it on

178
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
i was thinking probably won't put it on
 

179
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,910
i was thinking probably won't put it on
the sides

180
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
the sides
 

181
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,949
the sides
and uh the bottom there

182
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
and uh the bottom there
 

183
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,990
and uh the bottom there
don't think i will i don't know maybe uh

184
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
don't think i will i don't know maybe uh
 

185
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,710
don't think i will i don't know maybe uh
we should try work out the staircase

186
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
we should try work out the staircase
 

187
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,429
we should try work out the staircase
here

188
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
here
 

189
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,550
here
so i would like uh

190
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
so i would like uh
 

191
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,070
so i would like uh
this walkway to go up to here at least

192
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
this walkway to go up to here at least
 

193
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,149
this walkway to go up to here at least
and then it can start going down so i i

194
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
and then it can start going down so i i
 

195
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,750
and then it can start going down so i i
think i'm going to make the staircase go

196
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
think i'm going to make the staircase go
 

197
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,869
think i'm going to make the staircase go
down

198
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
down
 

199
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,470
down
and then halfway down it's going to

200
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
and then halfway down it's going to
 

201
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,430
and then halfway down it's going to
split to the left and to the right

202
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
split to the left and to the right
 

203
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,430
split to the left and to the right
and then same for the other side we'll

204
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
and then same for the other side we'll
 

205
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,110
and then same for the other side we'll
try copy it

206
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
try copy it
 

207
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,909
try copy it
and see how that turns out so

208
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919

 

209
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,590

get rid of these mushrooms i don't know

210
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
get rid of these mushrooms i don't know
 

211
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,830
get rid of these mushrooms i don't know
why i keep planting these things

212
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
why i keep planting these things
 

213
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,990
why i keep planting these things
i'll put one down randomly and then it's

214
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
i'll put one down randomly and then it's
 

215
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,590
i'll put one down randomly and then it's
splits into a million

216
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
splits into a million
 

217
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,469
splits into a million
like uh i don't know i keep doing it too

218
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
like uh i don't know i keep doing it too
 

219
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,030
like uh i don't know i keep doing it too
for some reason

220
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
for some reason
 

221
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,870
for some reason
okay so

222
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
okay so
 

223
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,150
okay so
actually let's make this wood here

224
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
actually let's make this wood here
 

225
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,590
actually let's make this wood here
we'll start the transition never dig

226
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
we'll start the transition never dig
 

227
00:04:49,600 --> 00:05:50,830
we'll start the transition never dig
straight down

228
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840

 

229
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:18,830

um

230
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840

 

231
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:32,830

um

232
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840

 

233
00:06:32,840 --> 00:07:14,830

so

234
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

235
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:33,430

up

236
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440

 

237
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,589

so we got the stairs laid out here i

238
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
so we got the stairs laid out here i
 

239
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,790
so we got the stairs laid out here i
think they're pretty good

240
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
think they're pretty good
 

241
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,990
think they're pretty good
the way they are um put grass up here

242
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
the way they are um put grass up here
 

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,550
the way they are um put grass up here
i'll have to rig up some lighting so i

244
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
i'll have to rig up some lighting so i
 

245
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,189
i'll have to rig up some lighting so i
can get rid of this torch

246
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
can get rid of this torch
 

247
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,909
can get rid of this torch
and then at the corner here i rounded it

248
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
and then at the corner here i rounded it
 

249
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,589
and then at the corner here i rounded it
out a little bit

250
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
out a little bit
 

251
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,029
out a little bit
and big guy over there you size uh

252
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
and big guy over there you size uh
 

253
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,230
and big guy over there you size uh
playing around with different

254
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
playing around with different
 

255
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,990
playing around with different
uh borders and stuff around here

256
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
uh borders and stuff around here
 

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,990
uh borders and stuff around here
different things i did kind of like the

258
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
different things i did kind of like the
 

259
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,510
different things i did kind of like the
fences

260
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
fences
 

261
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,350
fences
but i wasn't totally sold on it yet

262
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
but i wasn't totally sold on it yet
 

263
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,350
but i wasn't totally sold on it yet
and i did try out trapdoors on the

264
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
and i did try out trapdoors on the
 

265
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,469
and i did try out trapdoors on the
inside of the frame

266
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
inside of the frame
 

267
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,990
inside of the frame
i think it looks better so i'll keep it

268
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
i think it looks better so i'll keep it
 

269
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,550
i think it looks better so i'll keep it
like that gives it kind of a

270
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
like that gives it kind of a
 

271
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,390
like that gives it kind of a
more 3d look with the trapdoors sticking

272
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
more 3d look with the trapdoors sticking
 

273
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,189
more 3d look with the trapdoors sticking
out

274
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
out
 

275
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,909
out
um another thing i was thinking for this

276
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
um another thing i was thinking for this
 

277
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,390
um another thing i was thinking for this
frame

278
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
frame
 

279
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,749
frame
is maybe something like this although i

280
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
is maybe something like this although i
 

281
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,790
is maybe something like this although i
think it might have problems too

282
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
think it might have problems too
 

283
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,270
think it might have problems too
instead of having wood here

284
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280

 

285
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,310

you go down two blocks

286
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320

 

287
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,350

on the inside here

288
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
on the inside here
 

289
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,750
on the inside here
i would have a light source such as

290
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
i would have a light source such as
 

291
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,670
i would have a light source such as
pumpkins

292
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
pumpkins
 

293
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,910
pumpkins
for

294
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920

 

295
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,430

for a glowing uh bush type effect

296
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
for a glowing uh bush type effect
 

297
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,550
for a glowing uh bush type effect
actually yeah that's right

298
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
actually yeah that's right
 

299
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,230
actually yeah that's right
this would come up and then instead of

300
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
this would come up and then instead of
 

301
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,310
this would come up and then instead of
the wood on outside here it would be in

302
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
the wood on outside here it would be in
 

303
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,870
the wood on outside here it would be in
one block over here

304
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880

 

305
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,150

like that and that would help to get

306
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
like that and that would help to get
 

307
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,150
like that and that would help to get
light on this side from the pumpkins

308
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
light on this side from the pumpkins
 

309
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,750
light on this side from the pumpkins
and it would be a rail so i wouldn't

310
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
and it would be a rail so i wouldn't
 

311
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,670
and it would be a rail so i wouldn't
walk off but

312
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
walk off but
 

313
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,509
walk off but
the only problem with that idea is it

314
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
the only problem with that idea is it
 

315
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,269
the only problem with that idea is it
doesn't look quite as good on this side

316
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
doesn't look quite as good on this side
 

317
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:25,910
doesn't look quite as good on this side
i don't think

318
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
i don't think
 

319
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,949
i don't think
yeah that looks pretty crummy

320
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
yeah that looks pretty crummy
 

321
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,470
yeah that looks pretty crummy
otherwise i would definitely do it that

322
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
otherwise i would definitely do it that
 

323
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,949
otherwise i would definitely do it that
way

324
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959

 

325
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,670

so yeah i have to think about that for a

326
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
so yeah i have to think about that for a
 

327
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,550
so yeah i have to think about that for a
little bit yet

328
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560

 

329
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,630

so we do need some type of rail for our

330
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
so we do need some type of rail for our
 

331
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,790
so we do need some type of rail for our
stairs yet and i'm not exactly sure what

332
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
stairs yet and i'm not exactly sure what
 

333
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,070
stairs yet and i'm not exactly sure what
type of block to use

334
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
type of block to use
 

335
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,910
type of block to use
i might try some wood

336
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
i might try some wood
 

337
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,630
i might try some wood
maybe fences i don't know i think a

338
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
maybe fences i don't know i think a
 

339
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,430
maybe fences i don't know i think a
general rule

340
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
general rule
 

341
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,670
general rule
and this might just be my personal

342
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and this might just be my personal
 

343
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,190
and this might just be my personal
opinion but i think in general

344
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
opinion but i think in general
 

345
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,069
opinion but i think in general
is the stairs need to stand out more

346
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
is the stairs need to stand out more
 

347
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,509
is the stairs need to stand out more
than the rail itself

348
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
than the rail itself
 

349
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,590
than the rail itself
so for example i shouldn't use

350
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
so for example i shouldn't use
 

351
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,430
so for example i shouldn't use
sandstone as a rail for this because

352
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
sandstone as a rail for this because
 

353
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,870
sandstone as a rail for this because
then the sandstone rail

354
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
then the sandstone rail
 

355
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
then the sandstone rail
would stand out more than the wooden

356
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
would stand out more than the wooden
 

357
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,829
would stand out more than the wooden
stairs in my opinion

358
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839

 

359
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,389

um

360
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399

 

361
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,750

i might do

362
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760

 

363
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,269

something like that

364
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279

 

365
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,350

and then have fences perhaps

366
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360

 

367
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:44,829

um yeah i'm not good at aesthetics

368
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839

 

369
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,269

aesthetics try it out see how this goes

370
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279

 

371
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,870

that's not bad actually i don't mind

372
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
that's not bad actually i don't mind
 

373
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,949
that's not bad actually i don't mind
that

374
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
that
 

375
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,710
that
i have to go up higher maybe

376
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
i have to go up higher maybe
 

377
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,230
i have to go up higher maybe
oh that's all the blocks i had lame um

378
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
oh that's all the blocks i had lame um
 

379
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:11,350
oh that's all the blocks i had lame um
let's try out the dark wood too

380
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360

 

381
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,590

dark wood um

382
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
dark wood um
 

383
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,910
dark wood um
i do love this dark wood

384
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920

 

385
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,069

what do you guys think

386
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079

 

387
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,590

it makes the stairs really stand out

388
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
it makes the stairs really stand out
 

389
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,550
it makes the stairs really stand out
that's for sure

390
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560

 

391
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,509

okay i'll i'll try rig something up here

392
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519

 

393
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,949

there we go that's not bad i like that

394
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
there we go that's not bad i like that
 

395
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,350
there we go that's not bad i like that
i think the the dark wood was just a

396
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
i think the the dark wood was just a
 

397
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,509
i think the the dark wood was just a
little bit too high of contrast

398
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
little bit too high of contrast
 

399
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,430
little bit too high of contrast
especially when it was next to sandstone

400
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
especially when it was next to sandstone
 

401
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,829
especially when it was next to sandstone
but let me know what you think

402
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
but let me know what you think
 

403
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,870
but let me know what you think
i may change it after all

404
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
i may change it after all
 

405
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,590
i may change it after all
and then this will kind of just merge in

406
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
and then this will kind of just merge in
 

407
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,269
and then this will kind of just merge in
here

408
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
here
 

409
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,910
here
excuse me i'm catching a cold here

410
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920

 

411
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,949

um yeah i like that so

412
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
um yeah i like that so
 

413
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,790
um yeah i like that so
one thing i'm wondering about now though

414
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
one thing i'm wondering about now though
 

415
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,590
one thing i'm wondering about now though
is with the fences should i connect them

416
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
is with the fences should i connect them
 

417
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,150
is with the fences should i connect them
together

418
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
together
 

419
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,750
together
at the top if i do the fences like this

420
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
at the top if i do the fences like this
 

421
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,269
at the top if i do the fences like this
too

422
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
too
 

423
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,590
too
it would blend nicely if i put a fence

424
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
it would blend nicely if i put a fence
 

425
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,150
it would blend nicely if i put a fence
around this top

426
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
around this top
 

427
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,269
around this top
as well so that's a that's a plus

428
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
as well so that's a that's a plus
 

429
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,750
as well so that's a that's a plus
but should i do this and connect them

430
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
but should i do this and connect them
 

431
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,829
but should i do this and connect them
together

432
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
together
 

433
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,509
together
can't really do it on this one

434
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519

 

435
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,230

not sure

436
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240

 

437
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,310

again let me know what you think for now

438
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
again let me know what you think for now
 

439
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,829
again let me know what you think for now
i'm going to keep it the way it was

440
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

441
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,389

before

442
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
before
 

443
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,790
before
okay one last little detail here on the

444
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
okay one last little detail here on the
 

445
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,790
okay one last little detail here on the
inside of the staircase i have added

446
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
inside of the staircase i have added
 

447
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,670
inside of the staircase i have added
this little

448
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
this little
 

449
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,990
this little
station with chests and a crafting table

450
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
station with chests and a crafting table
 

451
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,670
station with chests and a crafting table
then we have glowing pumpkins behind

452
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
then we have glowing pumpkins behind
 

453
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,190
then we have glowing pumpkins behind
leaves for

454
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
leaves for
 

455
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,790
leaves for
light and i'm pretty happy with that too

456
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
light and i'm pretty happy with that too
 

457
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,790
light and i'm pretty happy with that too
so i think we'll end the staircase stuff

458
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
so i think we'll end the staircase stuff
 

459
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,790
so i think we'll end the staircase stuff
here today so i'll be

460
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
here today so i'll be
 

461
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,110
here today so i'll be
copying this assuming everybody likes it

462
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
copying this assuming everybody likes it
 

463
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,910
copying this assuming everybody likes it
i'll be copying that and putting it

464
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
i'll be copying that and putting it
 

465
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,150
i'll be copying that and putting it
another one over here

466
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
another one over here
 

467
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,069
another one over here
that will connect to the path there and

468
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
that will connect to the path there and
 

469
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,670
that will connect to the path there and
let you get down

470
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
let you get down
 

471
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,629
let you get down
as well is the plan and then in the

472
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
as well is the plan and then in the
 

473
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,310
as well is the plan and then in the
middle like i said i might do

474
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
middle like i said i might do
 

475
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,829
middle like i said i might do
an information board possibly

476
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
an information board possibly
 

477
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,750
an information board possibly
glass something or another over here

478
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760

 

479
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,269

okay so one thing i noticed as well

480
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
okay so one thing i noticed as well
 

481
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,629
okay so one thing i noticed as well
this ufo thing one of my favorite

482

487
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,910
uh working right now the water's not
dripping down like it used to

488
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
dripping down like it used to
 

489
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,030
dripping down like it used to
and i don't know why i don't

490
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
and i don't know why i don't
 

491
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,150
and i don't know why i don't
know why i'll have i'm gonna

492

know why i'll have i'm gonna
 

493
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,670
know why i'll have i'm gonna
i'll probably do it off camera but i'm

494
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
i'll probably do it off camera but i'm
 

495
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,629
i'll probably do it off camera but i'm
gonna try fix that back up again

496
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
gonna try fix that back up again
 

497
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,189
gonna try fix that back up again
maybe after i'm done recording today

498
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199

 

499
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,590

because this is where it got left off uh

500
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
because this is where it got left off uh
 

501
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,430
because this is where it got left off uh
after my world was corrupted

502
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
after my world was corrupted
 

503
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,550
after my world was corrupted
and i had to load the backup this is as

504
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
and i had to load the backup this is as
 

505
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,150
and i had to load the backup this is as
far as it was

506
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
far as it was
 

507
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,629
far as it was
so i need to put leaves all along here

508
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
so i need to put leaves all along here
 

509
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,750
so i need to put leaves all along here
where these blocks i'm removing are make

510
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
where these blocks i'm removing are make
 

511
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,829
where these blocks i'm removing are make
leaves two blocks high

512
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
leaves two blocks high
 

513
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,750
leaves two blocks high
here you didn't see that

514
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
here you didn't see that
 

515
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,150
here you didn't see that
two blocks high there and then i think i

516
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
two blocks high there and then i think i
 

517
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,470
two blocks high there and then i think i
had half slabs on this

518
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
had half slabs on this
 

519
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,590
had half slabs on this
ring of leaves the water needs to come

520
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
ring of leaves the water needs to come
 

521
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,629
ring of leaves the water needs to come
up and flow out

522
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
up and flow out
 

523
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,230
up and flow out
and then i put water channels

524
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
and then i put water channels
 

525
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,069
and then i put water channels
on top of these leaves which take the

526
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
on top of these leaves which take the
 

527
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,150
on top of these leaves which take the
cows to

528
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160

 

529
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,590

i'll probably make them drop down here

530
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
i'll probably make them drop down here
 

531
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,230
i'll probably make them drop down here
or something next to these mobs

532
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
or something next to these mobs
 

533
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,710
or something next to these mobs
yeah i'll do that some other time though

534
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
yeah i'll do that some other time though
 

535
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,230

of exploring here so i'm going to
drop off my better stuff here

621
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,230

it was this way

622
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240

 

623
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,270

629
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,270

yes it's looking right so it takes you

630
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
yes it's looking right so it takes you
 

631
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,150
yes it's looking right so it takes you
to this

632
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
to this
 

633
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,270
to this
area here which is nice and open

634
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
area here which is nice and open
 

635
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,069
area here which is nice and open
it would be a pretty good place to build

636
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
it would be a pretty good place to build
 

637
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,789
it would be a pretty good place to build
some stuff

638
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
some stuff
 

639
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,789
some stuff
and then if you keep going further it

640
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
and then if you keep going further it
 

641
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,510
and then if you keep going further it
gets even better

642
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520

 

643
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,590

get another really open area here

644
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
get another really open area here
 

645
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,830
get another really open area here
with uh pretty spacious caves and

646
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
with uh pretty spacious caves and
 

647
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,710

everything
 

649
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,150
everything
so this would be another good place to

650
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
so this would be another good place to
 

651
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,070
so this would be another good place to
build something

652
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
build something
 

653
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,669
build something
kinda it's pretty open over here

654
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
kinda it's pretty open over here
 

655
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,070
kinda it's pretty open over here
and then further there's still more

656
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
and then further there's still more
 

657
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,470
and then further there's still more
stuff

658
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480

 

659
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,470

so i want to finish up that one area but

660
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
so i want to finish up that one area but
 

661
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,150
so i want to finish up that one area but
as i'm doing that i might start building

662
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
as i'm doing that i might start building
 

663
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,190
as i'm doing that i might start building
here as well

664
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
here as well
 

665
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,150
here as well
and this is ravine

666
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160

 

667
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,070

which is pretty cool but further

668
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080

 

669
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,630

673
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,590

such an easy jump too okay further

674
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
such an easy jump too okay further
 

675
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,110
such an easy jump too okay further
we have yet another ravine up here

676
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120

 

677
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:40,549

there's actually a lot of mobs around

678
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559

 

679
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,230

uh and this place doesn't really lit up

680
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
uh and this place doesn't really lit up
 

681
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,630
uh and this place doesn't really lit up
too well

682
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640

 

683
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,789

it's the right one that might be in the

684
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
it's the right one that might be in the
 

685
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,070
it's the right one that might be in the
wrong spot

686
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
wrong spot
 

687
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,510
wrong spot
it goes up to the surface down

688
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
it goes up to the surface down
 

689
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,470
it goes up to the surface down
