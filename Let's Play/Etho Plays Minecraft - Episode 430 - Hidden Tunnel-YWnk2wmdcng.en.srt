00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:15,359
guys out of here I don't think this farm
 

161
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,099
guys out of here I don't think this farm
works anymore anyway yeah rabbits say

162
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:19,109
works anymore anyway yeah rabbits say
 

163
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:20,539
works anymore anyway yeah rabbits say
like Golden carrots they also like

164
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:20,549
like Golden carrots they also like
 

165
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,390
like Golden carrots they also like
regular carrots oh man they're jumping

all over the place you guys still stuck
 

169
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
all over the place you guys still stuck
there

170
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,170
there
 

171
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,750
there
how did that one get out if these ones

172
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:29,760
how did that one get out if these ones
 

173
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,190
how did that one get out if these ones
can't kind of odd alright oh they're not

174
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,200
can't kind of odd alright oh they're not
 

175
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,450
can't kind of odd alright oh they're not
the brightest yeah so check this out the

176
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,460
the brightest yeah so check this out the
 

177
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,580
the brightest yeah so check this out the
rabbits are definitely following me here

178
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:43,590
rabbits are definitely following me here
 

179
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,980
rabbits are definitely following me here
the pigs could care less though they

180
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:45,990
the pigs could care less though they
 

181
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,170
the pigs could care less though they
don't want the golden carrot golden

182
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
don't want the golden carrot golden
 

183
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,240
don't want the golden carrot golden
carrots are one of the best food sources

184
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,250
carrots are one of the best food sources
 

185
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,620
carrots are one of the best food sources
in the game so I would much rather

186
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,630
in the game so I would much rather
 

187
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,820
in the game so I would much rather
switch to them than regular carrots and

188
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:55,830
switch to them than regular carrots and
 

189
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,340
switch to them than regular carrots and
so with that in mind guys I have updated

190
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:58,350
so with that in mind guys I have updated
 

191
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,930
so with that in mind guys I have updated
from pig power to rabbit power now I am

192
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:02,940
from pig power to rabbit power now I am
 

193
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,630
from pig power to rabbit power now I am
an I spent so much time on this so many

194
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:05,640
an I spent so much time on this so many
 

195
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,960
an I spent so much time on this so many
failed designs I got one now that I'm

196
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:08,970
failed designs I got one now that I'm
 

197
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,630
failed designs I got one now that I'm
pretty happy with I looked at your

198
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:11,640
pretty happy with I looked at your
 

199
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,490
pretty happy with I looked at your
guys's suggestions I tried a bunch of

200
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:13,500
guys's suggestions I tried a bunch of
 

201
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,250
guys's suggestions I tried a bunch of
them like using more than one Pig or

202
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,260
them like using more than one Pig or
 

203
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,290
them like using more than one Pig or
more than one rabbits trying to use

204
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,300
more than one rabbits trying to use
 

205
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,000
more than one rabbits trying to use
unpowered power rails because they have

206
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,010
unpowered power rails because they have
 

207
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,460
unpowered power rails because they have
more friction a lot of that stuff it

208
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,470
more friction a lot of that stuff it
 

209
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,270
more friction a lot of that stuff it
just didn't work out too well I tried

210
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
just didn't work out too well I tried
 

211
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,660
just didn't work out too well I tried
like having a timer that's that had to

212
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:29,670
like having a timer that's that had to
 

213
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,490
like having a timer that's that had to
run before the door would open and a

214
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500
run before the door would open and a
 

215
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,280
run before the door would open and a
whole bunch of stuff basically it was

216
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,290
whole bunch of stuff basically it was
 

217
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,610
whole bunch of stuff basically it was
flawed flawed design right so I got a

218
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,620
flawed flawed design right so I got a
 

219
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,620
flawed flawed design right so I got a
new thing here went back to the old

220
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:39,630
new thing here went back to the old
 

221
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,330
new thing here went back to the old
method of using water and now this seems

222
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:44,340
method of using water and now this seems
 

223
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,740
method of using water and now this seems
to work pretty good you see like when

224
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:45,750
to work pretty good you see like when
 

225
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,070
to work pretty good you see like when
the rabbits in watching mode he does

226
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,080
the rabbits in watching mode he does
 

227
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,750
the rabbits in watching mode he does
these little hops he doesn't actually

228
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:50,760
these little hops he doesn't actually
 

229
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,730
these little hops he doesn't actually
jump into the water it's not until he

230
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,740
jump into the water it's not until he
 

231
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,760
jump into the water it's not until he
gets excited with the golden carrot or

232
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,770
gets excited with the golden carrot or
 

233
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,880
gets excited with the golden carrot or
regular carrots that he jumps he does a

234
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:00,890
regular carrots that he jumps he does a
 

235
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,470
regular carrots that he jumps he does a
jump he gets stuck in the water and

236
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:03,480
jump he gets stuck in the water and
 

237
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,570
jump he gets stuck in the water and
since the animals they float in water

238
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:05,580
since the animals they float in water
 

239
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,270
since the animals they float in water
his head kind of rides against the top

240
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,280
his head kind of rides against the top
 

241
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,790
his head kind of rides against the top
of the glass there then I have a stair

242
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
of the glass there then I have a stair
 

243
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,410
of the glass there then I have a stair
so there's a little bit of an airspace

244
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:12,420
so there's a little bit of an airspace
 

245
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,650
so there's a little bit of an airspace
there and the top of his head hits the

246
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:15,660
there and the top of his head hits the
 

247
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,610
there and the top of his head hits the
tripwire and then he falls down and gets

248
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:18,620
tripwire and then he falls down and gets
 

249
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,830
tripwire and then he falls down and gets
sent back to the start here so it's

250
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
sent back to the start here so it's
 

251
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,730
sent back to the start here so it's
pretty close to perfect I think there's

252
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:25,740
pretty close to perfect I think there's
 

253
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,640
pretty close to perfect I think there's
only one flaw with it if he's very close

254
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,650
only one flaw with it if he's very close
 

255
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,750
only one flaw with it if he's very close
to the edge there that last block he

256
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:32,760
to the edge there that last block he
 

257
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,930
to the edge there that last block he
sometimes won't jump or if I'm close to

258
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:35,940
sometimes won't jump or if I'm close to
 

259
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,170
sometimes won't jump or if I'm close to
him you see this he's not jumping now

260
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,180
him you see this he's not jumping now
 

261
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,920
him you see this he's not jumping now
because he's already

262
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:39,930
because he's already
 

263
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,740
because he's already
he can get to me so it's not until he

264
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:42,750
he can get to me so it's not until he
 

265
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,219
he can get to me so it's not until he
has to move that he'll actually jump is

266
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:46,229
has to move that he'll actually jump is
 

267
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,610
has to move that he'll actually jump is
the problem and what I ended up doing I

268
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
the problem and what I ended up doing I
 

269
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,710
the problem and what I ended up doing I
hooked this up just to a hopper hopper

270
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:51,720
hooked this up just to a hopper hopper
 

271
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,140
hooked this up just to a hopper hopper
timer and that works so great because I

272
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,150
timer and that works so great because I
 

273
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,120
timer and that works so great because I
can set how long I want like a cool-down

274
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,130
can set how long I want like a cool-down
 

275
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,100
can set how long I want like a cool-down
I instead a cool-down so like if he

276
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,110
I instead a cool-down so like if he
 

277
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,950
I instead a cool-down so like if he
activates the tripwire again it has to

278
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:03,960
activates the tripwire again it has to
 

279
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,050
activates the tripwire again it has to
wait for this timer to finish before

280
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,060
wait for this timer to finish before
 

281
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,240
wait for this timer to finish before
it'll activate the door again that way

282
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,250
it'll activate the door again that way
 

283
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,890
it'll activate the door again that way
it's not like open-close open-close

284
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:09,900
it's not like open-close open-close
 

285
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,370
it's not like open-close open-close
like it was doing before so it's pretty

286
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,380
like it was doing before so it's pretty
 

287
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,499
like it was doing before so it's pretty
smooth and unselected if I don't want it

288
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:18,509
smooth and unselected if I don't want it
 

289
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,469
smooth and unselected if I don't want it
to do anything or I can just hold the

290
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:21,479
to do anything or I can just hold the
 

291
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,960
to do anything or I can just hold the
carrot selected and they'll keep opening

292
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:23,970
carrot selected and they'll keep opening
 

293
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,390
carrot selected and they'll keep opening
and closing give them a second to find

294
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
and closing give them a second to find
 

295
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,620
and closing give them a second to find
the carrot again oh yeah it's got to

296
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,630
the carrot again oh yeah it's got to
 

297
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,409
the carrot again oh yeah it's got to
wait for that delay because I I took the

298
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:36,419
wait for that delay because I I took the
 

299
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,379
wait for that delay because I I took the
carrot away from them all right so yeah

300
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:42,389
carrot away from them all right so yeah
 

301
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,120
carrot away from them all right so yeah
there's a little bit of a cool-down so

302
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,130
there's a little bit of a cool-down so
 

303
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,550
there's a little bit of a cool-down so
it just opens and closes slowly which is

304
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
it just opens and closes slowly which is
 

305
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,159
it just opens and closes slowly which is
nice and I can set that to whatever I

306
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,169
nice and I can set that to whatever I
 

307
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,140
nice and I can set that to whatever I
want so I'm really happy with this I'm

308
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,150
want so I'm really happy with this I'm
 

309
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,170
want so I'm really happy with this I'm
going to again though just watch it for

310
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,180
going to again though just watch it for
 

311
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,700
going to again though just watch it for
a little bit and see if I like it if I

312
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:55,710
a little bit and see if I like it if I
 

313
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,070
a little bit and see if I like it if I
do this seems like it's going to be good

314
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
do this seems like it's going to be good
 

315
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,670
do this seems like it's going to be good
we're going to add these circuits to

316
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
we're going to add these circuits to
 

317
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,640
we're going to add these circuits to
more parts of the man cave probably like

318
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:04,650
more parts of the man cave probably like
 

319
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,469
more parts of the man cave probably like
the snowball fountain and there's a

320
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
the snowball fountain and there's a
 

321
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,909
the snowball fountain and there's a
bunch of things I'd like to connect it

322
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
bunch of things I'd like to connect it
 

323
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,350
bunch of things I'd like to connect it
to alright guys so I do have an idea in

324
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,360
to alright guys so I do have an idea in
 

325
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,540
to alright guys so I do have an idea in
mind for a project we could start today

326
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,550
mind for a project we could start today
 

327
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,080
mind for a project we could start today
it's a new project probably shouldn't

328
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,090
it's a new project probably shouldn't
 

329
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,320
it's a new project probably shouldn't
start a new project but I do what I want

330
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,330
start a new project but I do what I want
 

331
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,839
start a new project but I do what I want
you can't stop me no this one should be

332
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:23,849
you can't stop me no this one should be
 

333
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,320
you can't stop me no this one should be
fun it's kind of simple in concept but

334
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,330
fun it's kind of simple in concept but
 

335
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,960
fun it's kind of simple in concept but
it is a little bit of work probably it

336
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,970
it is a little bit of work probably it
 

337
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,870
it is a little bit of work probably it
involves tea and tea so you know it's

338
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
involves tea and tea so you know it's
 

339
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,409
involves tea and tea so you know it's
gonna be good and since the glider Wings

340
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:36,419
gonna be good and since the glider Wings
 

341
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,079
gonna be good and since the glider Wings
have come out I've wanted to make like a

342
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:39,089
have come out I've wanted to make like a
 

343
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,940
have come out I've wanted to make like a
tunnel underground that you have to fly

344
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:40,950
tunnel underground that you have to fly
 

345
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,940
tunnel underground that you have to fly
through and I just realized there's

346
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:43,950
through and I just realized there's
 

347
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,250
through and I just realized there's
quite a bit of space behind this

348
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,260
quite a bit of space behind this
 

349
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,370
quite a bit of space behind this
waterfall if we do it just right like my

350
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,380
waterfall if we do it just right like my
 

351
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,500
waterfall if we do it just right like my
my man cave here is is loaded with

352
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,510
my man cave here is is loaded with
 

353
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,420
my man cave here is is loaded with
redstone and stuff

354
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,430
redstone and stuff
 

355
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,830
redstone and stuff
let's just see what it would take to

356
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:56,840
let's just see what it would take to
 

357
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,740
let's just see what it would take to
start flying around here and what I want

358
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:00,750
start flying around here and what I want
 

359
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,760
start flying around here and what I want
to do ok this we don't worry about this

360
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:06,770
to do ok this we don't worry about this
 

361
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,290

down to the fishing Hut this is part of
 

367
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,470
down to the fishing Hut this is part of
the portal stuff I think and that's the

368
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
the portal stuff I think and that's the
 

369
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,990
the portal stuff I think and that's the
ender dispenser thing up there just

TNT at this part of the tunnel because I
 

377
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,780
TNT at this part of the tunnel because I
know I'm going to wreck something really

important if we do that but I want this
 

381
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,920

tunnel to kind of make its way over to

382
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,930
tunnel to kind of make its way over to
 

383
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,680

the library and also if we want to add
 

385
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,660
the library and also if we want to add
on to the man cave we can you can do it

386
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,670
on to the man cave we can you can do it
 

387
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,970
on to the man cave we can you can do it
using this tunnel as well as a one-way

388
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:46,980
using this tunnel as well as a one-way
 

389
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,830
using this tunnel as well as a one-way
journey sort of thing because we're

390
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:48,840
journey sort of thing because we're
 

391
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,760

alright dig like a madman here let's see
if we can get flight with this little

406
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:14,730
if we can get flight with this little
 

407
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,460
if we can get flight with this little
bit chopped out or if we have to go

408
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,470
bit chopped out or if we have to go
 

409
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,640
bit chopped out or if we have to go
lower because ideally what I would like

410
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:19,650
lower because ideally what I would like
 

411
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,970
lower because ideally what I would like
just a nice convenient thing I could be

412
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
just a nice convenient thing I could be
 

413
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,940
just a nice convenient thing I could be

was in the way um I'm worried about
 

419
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,560
was in the way um I'm worried about
making a mess here let's take out this

420

making a mess here let's take out this
 

421
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,880
making a mess here let's take out this
dirt go down a few more blocks EDD yes

Wilson no it's the portal thing oh and
 

433
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,240
Wilson no it's the portal thing oh and
it goes further oh no no okay

it goes further oh no no okay
 

435
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,110
it goes further oh no no okay
okay I got a call tech supports I only

436
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
okay I got a call tech supports I only
 

437
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,540
okay I got a call tech supports I only
found one redstone dust one repeater I

438
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,550
found one redstone dust one repeater I
 

439
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,700
found one redstone dust one repeater I
can probably fix it I think I saw where

440
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:17,710
can probably fix it I think I saw where
 

441
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,730
can probably fix it I think I saw where
the repeater goes already

442
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:19,740
the repeater goes already
 

443
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,140
the repeater goes already
that's like let's just double-check Oh

444
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,150
that's like let's just double-check Oh
 

445
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,360
that's like let's just double-check Oh
bad throw oh snap it's really hard to

446
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,370
bad throw oh snap it's really hard to
 

447
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,040
bad throw oh snap it's really hard to
add anything new to the man cave because

448
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,050
add anything new to the man cave because
 

449
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,720
add anything new to the man cave because
there's so much stuff around

450
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:30,730
there's so much stuff around
 

451
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,950
there's so much stuff around
I'm guessing this was set on four and

452
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm guessing this was set on four and
 

453
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm guessing this was set on four and
the redstone dust must have been just

454
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,610
the redstone dust must have been just
 

455
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,150
the redstone dust must have been just
over here right could it really be that

456
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
over here right could it really be that
 

457
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,090
over here right could it really be that
simple of a fix yeah this looks okay so

458
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,100
simple of a fix yeah this looks okay so
 

459
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,610
simple of a fix yeah this looks okay so
I'm good all right all right let's try

460
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:47,620
I'm good all right all right let's try
 

461
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,150
I'm good all right all right let's try
this again Oh what would you know let's

462
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,160
this again Oh what would you know let's
 

463
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,830
this again Oh what would you know let's
just shut no we can shut off the water

464
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:52,840
just shut no we can shut off the water
 

465
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,570
just shut no we can shut off the water
we need it to test this man um let me

466
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:57,580
we need it to test this man um let me
 

467
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,220
we need it to test this man um let me
fill in some blocks then yeah because we

468
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,230
fill in some blocks then yeah because we
 

469
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,780
fill in some blocks then yeah because we
want to fly through the waterfall that

470
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:03,790
want to fly through the waterfall that
 

471
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,580
want to fly through the waterfall that
would be a lot cooler all right slowly

472
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:08,590
would be a lot cooler all right slowly
 

473

dirt now okay
 

479
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,300
dirt now okay
is that enough to get through okay so we

480
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,310
is that enough to get through okay so we
 

481
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,950
is that enough to get through okay so we
run over the bridge whoo not quite I

think I gotta get rid of a few more
 

485
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,150
think I gotta get rid of a few more
blocks okay here we go

486
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,160
blocks okay here we go
 

487
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,430
blocks okay here we go
here we go just mined out a bunch of

488
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
here we go just mined out a bunch of
 

489
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
here we go just mined out a bunch of
blocks let's see if we can get flight

490
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:36,730
blocks let's see if we can get flight
 

491
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,780
blocks let's see if we can get flight
now oh that was a bad jump that was a

492
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,790
now oh that was a bad jump that was a
 

493
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,070

bad bad jump
I like landed on the fence let's try it

496
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:43,960
I like landed on the fence let's try it
 

497
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,370
I like landed on the fence let's try it
again

498
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:44,380
again
 

499
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,330

513
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:17,129
think we got a mind more around here I
was the guess I'm gonna do my first TNT

514
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:17,139
was the guess I'm gonna do my first TNT
 

515
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,769
was the guess I'm gonna do my first TNT
I'm scared it was fine it was good I

516
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:22,779
I'm scared it was fine it was good I
 

517
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm scared it was fine it was good I
want to use TNT if we can because it'll

518
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:25,550
want to use TNT if we can because it'll
 

519
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,079
want to use TNT if we can because it'll
make the tunnel more organic clicking

520
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,089
make the tunnel more organic clicking
 

521
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,249
make the tunnel more organic clicking
which would be better we're getting

522
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:30,259
which would be better we're getting
 

523
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,530
which would be better we're getting
really close to that fishing village and

524
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:32,540
really close to that fishing village and
 

525
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,749
really close to that fishing village and
we are at Y 36 I'm doing it I'm guessing

526
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:37,759
we are at Y 36 I'm doing it I'm guessing
 

527
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,579
we are at Y 36 I'm doing it I'm guessing
we're gonna have to add some sort of

528
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:39,589
we're gonna have to add some sort of
 

529
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,410
we're gonna have to add some sort of
boosters along the way to make it all

530
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:41,420
boosters along the way to make it all
 

531
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,540
boosters along the way to make it all
the way to the library but will will

532
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,550
the way to the library but will will
 

533
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,110
the way to the library but will will
tackle that problem when we get to it

534
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
tackle that problem when we get to it
 

535
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,430
tackle that problem when we get to it
see I would like to do two TNT at once

536
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:54,440
see I would like to do two TNT at once
 

537
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,860

going down a little too steeply actually
 

575
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,929
going down a little too steeply actually
which is good cuz I was worried we were

576
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:55,939
which is good cuz I was worried we were
 

577
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:58,629
which is good cuz I was worried we were
losing a lot of height there let's try

578
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
losing a lot of height there let's try
 

579
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,030
losing a lot of height there let's try
it one more time

580
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040

 

581
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,820

my plan is to then grow a bunch of trees

582
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:03,830
my plan is to then grow a bunch of trees
 

583
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,910
my plan is to then grow a bunch of trees
in this tunnel and like shear all the

584
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:06,920
in this tunnel and like shear all the
 

585
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,410
in this tunnel and like shear all the
leaves in the middle and then it'll be

586
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,420
leaves in the middle and then it'll be
 

587
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,510
leaves in the middle and then it'll be
like leaves all around the tunnel and

588
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:10,520
like leaves all around the tunnel and
 

589
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,940
like leaves all around the tunnel and
like wood and and stuff and then add a

590
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:12,950
like wood and and stuff and then add a
 

591
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,150
like wood and and stuff and then add a
couple key key points of interest later

592
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
couple key key points of interest later
 

593
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,890
couple key key points of interest later
too

594
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:16,900
too
 

595
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,480
too
but this is about the size of tunnel I

596
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,490
but this is about the size of tunnel I
 

597
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,620
but this is about the size of tunnel I
want what we have here this feels good

598
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:22,630
want what we have here this feels good
 

599
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,530
want what we have here this feels good
okay so the method I'm using to do this

600
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:26,540
okay so the method I'm using to do this
 

601
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,320
okay so the method I'm using to do this
by the way is just double placing tea

602
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,330
by the way is just double placing tea
 

603
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,290
by the way is just double placing tea
and tea seems to work very well I think

604
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,300
and tea seems to work very well I think
 

605
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,820
and tea seems to work very well I think
I want to start veering to the left

606
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:33,830
I want to start veering to the left
 

607
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,470
I want to start veering to the left
again we're trying to go pretty much

608
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,480
again we're trying to go pretty much
 

609
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,900
again we're trying to go pretty much
diagonally to get to the library here

610
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:37,910
diagonally to get to the library here
 

611
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,510
diagonally to get to the library here
but if we just do straight diagonal it's

612
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,520
but if we just do straight diagonal it's
 

613
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,740
but if we just do straight diagonal it's
going to be really boring so I'm trying

614
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:44,750
going to be really boring so I'm trying
 

615
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,870
going to be really boring so I'm trying
to like wind it a little bit as we go -

616
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
to like wind it a little bit as we go -
 

617
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,710
to like wind it a little bit as we go -
just to make it more fun all right

618
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:53,720
just to make it more fun all right
 

619
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,480
just to make it more fun all right

621
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,740
Oh what what are we at here now 28 we
got a little ways to go down yet ah I'm

622
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:02,750
got a little ways to go down yet ah I'm
 

623
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,180
got a little ways to go down yet ah I'm
only going to do one here if there's

624
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,190
only going to do one here if there's
 

625
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,970
only going to do one here if there's
ever dirt I just do one because it can

626
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:06,980
ever dirt I just do one because it can
 

627
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,540
ever dirt I just do one because it can
do a lot of damage through that dirt got

628
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,550
do a lot of damage through that dirt got
 

629
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,280
do a lot of damage through that dirt got
some guild see now I want to go more

630
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,290
some guild see now I want to go more
 

631
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,540
some guild see now I want to go more
this way get a real sharp turn you know

632
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:21,550
this way get a real sharp turn you know
 

633
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,120
this way get a real sharp turn you know
all right it's cool I'm gonna do more

634
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,130
all right it's cool I'm gonna do more
 

635
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,730
all right it's cool I'm gonna do more
blasting here and then we'll try it out

636
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:27,740
blasting here and then we'll try it out
 

637
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:47,239
blasting here and then we'll try it out
again you guys don't look at explosions

638
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:47,249

 

639
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,559

awesome so let me give you guys an

640
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:49,569
awesome so let me give you guys an
 

641
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,919
awesome so let me give you guys an
update now we're at y12 silver we're

642
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:52,929
update now we're at y12 silver we're
 

643
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,869
update now we're at y12 silver we're
like at lava level getting close to

644
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:54,879
like at lava level getting close to
 

645
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,900
like at lava level getting close to
bedrock here which means we kind of need

646
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:57,910
bedrock here which means we kind of need
 

647
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,960
bedrock here which means we kind of need
to come up with a way of making this go

648
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:00,970
to come up with a way of making this go
 

649
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,230
to come up with a way of making this go
further without going down any more

650
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,240
further without going down any more
 

651
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,870
further without going down any more
which the only thing that comes to mind

652
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
which the only thing that comes to mind
 

653
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,389
which the only thing that comes to mind
is that booster thing I made like when

654
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:09,399
is that booster thing I made like when
 

655
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:12,149
is that booster thing I made like when
the latter wings first came out but it

656
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:12,159
the latter wings first came out but it
 

657
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,279
the latter wings first came out but it
wasn't very reliable I don't know if I

658
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:14,289
wasn't very reliable I don't know if I
 

659
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,259
wasn't very reliable I don't know if I
could make it better but that would be a

660
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:16,269
could make it better but that would be a
 

661
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,470
could make it better but that would be a
cool thing to have like right over here

662
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
cool thing to have like right over here
 

663
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,090
cool thing to have like right over here
and ever we would probably only need one

664
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,100
and ever we would probably only need one
 

665
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,600
and ever we would probably only need one
or two to make it the rest of the way

666
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:23,610
or two to make it the rest of the way
 

667
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,039
or two to make it the rest of the way
yeah because we're only going up to

668
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,049
yeah because we're only going up to
 

669
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:31,200
yeah because we're only going up to
minus about 540 on the Zed so it's

670
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,210
minus about 540 on the Zed so it's
 

671
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,610
minus about 540 on the Zed so it's
pretty close it's only about a hundred

672
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:32,620
pretty close it's only about a hundred
 

673
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,570
pretty close it's only about a hundred
blocks further but yeah look at this

674
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:36,580
blocks further but yeah look at this
 

675
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,899
blocks further but yeah look at this
tunnel guys I use less than two stacks

676
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:39,909
tunnel guys I use less than two stacks
 

677
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,369
tunnel guys I use less than two stacks
of TNT too I surprised how efficient TNT

678
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:44,379
of TNT too I surprised how efficient TNT
 

679
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:47,789
of TNT too I surprised how efficient TNT
is at T is at making tunnels like this

680
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:47,799
is at T is at making tunnels like this
 

681
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,930
is at T is at making tunnels like this
is a really long tunnel look how much

682
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:51,940
is a really long tunnel look how much
 

683
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,090
is a really long tunnel look how much
how many blocks I mined out like I

684
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,100
how many blocks I mined out like I
 

685
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,460
how many blocks I mined out like I
didn't use my pick very much just when

686
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,470
didn't use my pick very much just when
 

687
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,440
didn't use my pick very much just when
there was some stray blocks every so

688
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,450
there was some stray blocks every so
 

689
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,279
there was some stray blocks every so
often alright let's go for a fly here I

690
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:04,289
often alright let's go for a fly here I
 

691
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:06,389
often alright let's go for a fly here I
got to get rid of these yellow and red

692
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:06,399
got to get rid of these yellow and red
 

693
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,399
got to get rid of these yellow and red
flowers too I do not like yellow and red

694
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:08,409
flowers too I do not like yellow and red
 

695
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,769
flowers too I do not like yellow and red
flowers anymore you got to go for pink

696
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:10,779
flowers anymore you got to go for pink
 

697
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,560
flowers anymore you got to go for pink
tulips guys it's it's all the crazy pink

698
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,570
tulips guys it's it's all the crazy pink
 

699
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,749
tulips guys it's it's all the crazy pink

00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:15,759
and whites sometimes orange is okay
 

701
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,080
and whites sometimes orange is okay

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,090
right now and then yeah I like these
 

703
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,159
right now and then yeah I like these
flowers a lot more alright here we go we

flowers a lot more alright here we go we
 

705
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,480
flowers a lot more alright here we go we
don't care about the that girly stuff

706
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,490
don't care about the that girly stuff
 

707
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:31,139
don't care about the that girly stuff
okay whoa whoa oh man I hit the wall no

708
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:31,149
okay whoa whoa oh man I hit the wall no
 

709
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,299

oh I suck
 

711
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,769
oh I suck
I got tried again gonna try it again I

712
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:36,779
I got tried again gonna try it again I
 

713
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,799
I got tried again gonna try it again I
haven't haven't tested like the last 50

714
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:40,809
haven't haven't tested like the last 50
 

715
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,480
haven't haven't tested like the last 50
blocks or so we've mined here so I'm

716
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,490
blocks or so we've mined here so I'm
 

717
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,480
blocks or so we've mined here so I'm
hoping open it's all good I've been

718
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,490
hoping open it's all good I've been
 

719
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,669
hoping open it's all good I've been
testing it periodically as I as I've

720
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
testing it periodically as I as I've
 

721
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,180
testing it periodically as I as I've
been doing this just in case like you

722
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190
been doing this just in case like you
 

723
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,190
been doing this just in case like you
know if I'm not if the elevation isn't

724
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
know if I'm not if the elevation isn't
 

725
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,560
know if I'm not if the elevation isn't
going down enough I would want not want

726
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,570
going down enough I would want not want
 

727
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,770
going down enough I would want not want
to continue

728
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:56,780
to continue
 

729
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,390
to continue
making the tunnel because then you won't

730
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,400
making the tunnel because then you won't
 

731
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,700
making the tunnel because then you won't
be able to do that the whatever you're

732
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:03,710
be able to do that the whatever you're
 

733
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,620
be able to do that the whatever you're
extending onto it you know you have to

734
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,630
extending onto it you know you have to
 

735
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,700
extending onto it you know you have to
make sure every section is doable all

736
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:09,710
make sure every section is doable all
 

737
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,380
make sure every section is doable all
right try it again

738
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,390
right try it again
 

739
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,770
right try it again
whoo all right I like the speed we're

740
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:14,780
whoo all right I like the speed we're
 

741
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,149
whoo all right I like the speed we're
going through here too it's it's nice

742
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:16,159
going through here too it's it's nice
 

743
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,880
going through here too it's it's nice
and quick it's not too slow I know it's

744
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:18,890
and quick it's not too slow I know it's
 

745
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,100
and quick it's not too slow I know it's
more efficient if you if you go slower

746
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,110
more efficient if you if you go slower
 

747
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,029
more efficient if you if you go slower
but I like cruising through it like that

748
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:24,039
but I like cruising through it like that
 

749
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,080
but I like cruising through it like that
so yeah we made it all the way to the

750
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,090
so yeah we made it all the way to the
 

751
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,820
so yeah we made it all the way to the
end there that's cool very cool all

752
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:30,830
end there that's cool very cool all
 

753
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,570
end there that's cool very cool all
right

754
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:31,580
right
 

755
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,070
right
um mm-hmm do we try make the bounce pad

756
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
um mm-hmm do we try make the bounce pad
 

757
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,470
um mm-hmm do we try make the bounce pad
I don't know okay guys so I decided to

758
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:41,480
I don't know okay guys so I decided to
 

759
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,390
I don't know okay guys so I decided to
hop into a creative world here back

760
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,400
hop into a creative world here back
 

761
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,940
hop into a creative world here back
where we had this bounce pad to do some

762
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:45,950
where we had this bounce pad to do some
 

763
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,669
where we had this bounce pad to do some
research with it oh man that didn't work

764
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:48,679
research with it oh man that didn't work
 

765
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,730
research with it oh man that didn't work
really to see how feasible it is to

766
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:51,740
really to see how feasible it is to
 

767
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,330
really to see how feasible it is to
actually use like in our tunnel it turns

768
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,340
actually use like in our tunnel it turns
 

769
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,779
actually use like in our tunnel it turns
out it is not reliable you have to have

770
00:19:58,779 --> 00:19:58,789
out it is not reliable you have to have
 

771
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,899
out it is not reliable you have to have
the right speed the right angle and hit

772
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:01,909
the right speed the right angle and hit
 

773
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,029
the right speed the right angle and hit
the right position with very little

774
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,039
the right position with very little
 

775
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,659
the right position with very little
likely way to it's even this where I'm

776
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:07,669
likely way to it's even this where I'm
 

777
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,750
likely way to it's even this where I'm
precisely controlling my camera angle my

778
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:10,760
precisely controlling my camera angle my
 

779
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,690
precisely controlling my camera angle my
position and like I'm holding forward

780
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:13,700
position and like I'm holding forward
 

781
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,779
position and like I'm holding forward
the entire time and even still it

782
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:16,789
the entire time and even still it
 

783
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,960
the entire time and even still it
sometimes is messing up on me like you

784
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,970
sometimes is messing up on me like you
 

785
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,430
sometimes is messing up on me like you
have to get it just right

786
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
have to get it just right
 

787
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,510
have to get it just right
to work I gotta keep hitting my head I

788
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
