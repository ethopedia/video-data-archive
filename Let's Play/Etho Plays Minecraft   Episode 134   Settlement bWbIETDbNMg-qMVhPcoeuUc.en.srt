these pistons um
 

137
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,949
these pistons um
let's see it's going to be tough

138
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
let's see it's going to be tough
 

139

positioning these

140
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
positioning these
 

141
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,550
positioning these
so when i do uh these double piston

142
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
so when i do uh these double piston
 

143
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,710
so when i do uh these double piston
doors that was pointless

two pistons like that and that one wire
 

171
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,110
two pistons like that and that one wire
there powers both pistons

172
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
there powers both pistons
 

173
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,789
there powers both pistons
okay and same for the other side

174
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799

 

175
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,390

that no no that doesn't work what am i
 

177
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,830
that no no that doesn't work what am i
doing

178
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

179
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,150

ah it has to i need another

180
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
ah it has to i need another
 

181
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,629
ah it has to i need another
two blocks width for that to work

182
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639

 

183
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,310

there i can't put this here because then

184
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
there i can't put this here because then
 

185
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,950
there i can't put this here because then
you'll see it

186
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960

 

187
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,550

oh nuts i thought i had that figured out

188
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560

 

189
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,110

yeah actually that should be fine

190
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
yeah actually that should be fine
 

191
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,710
yeah actually that should be fine
usually when i do these though i put the

192
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
usually when i do these though i put the
 

193
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,670
usually when i do these though i put the
redstone

194
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
redstone
 

195
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,510
redstone
wiring behind the pistons but if they're

196
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
wiring behind the pistons but if they're
 

197
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,510
wiring behind the pistons but if they're
off on the side

198
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
off on the side
 

199
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,510
off on the side
like this it's not a big deal either as

200
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
like this it's not a big deal either as
 

201
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,710
like this it's not a big deal either as
long as

202
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
long as
 

203
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,749
long as
i got blocks here to hide the wiring

204
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
i got blocks here to hide the wiring
 

205
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,990
i got blocks here to hide the wiring
and i'll just have a door frame around

206
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
and i'll just have a door frame around
 

207
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,830
and i'll just have a door frame around
here

208
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
here
 

209
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,070
here
this glass will probably get switched to

210
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
this glass will probably get switched to
 

211
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,030
this glass will probably get switched to
iron

212
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
iron
 

213
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,030
iron
so it matches that door just a smaller

214
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
so it matches that door just a smaller
 

215
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,670
so it matches that door just a smaller
version

216
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680

 

217
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,070

this will go all the way through same

218
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
this will go all the way through same
 

219
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,390
this will go all the way through same
with this one

220
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
with this one
 

221
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,790
with this one
and yeah so if you

222
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800

 

223
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,550

see where is that i think the redstone

224
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
see where is that i think the redstone
 

225
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,909
see where is that i think the redstone
is above here

226
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
is above here
 

227
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,749
is above here
so if you have a redstone torch below

228
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
so if you have a redstone torch below
 

229
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,189
so if you have a redstone torch below
that uh both pistons will extend

230
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
that uh both pistons will extend
 

231
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,950
that uh both pistons will extend
so you just have to connect uh

232
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
so you just have to connect uh
 

233
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,430
so you just have to connect uh
two redstone torches together below that

234
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
two redstone torches together below that
 

235
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,469
two redstone torches together below that
and then

236
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
and then
 

237
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,870
and then
control the door that way

238
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880

 

239
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,230

all right and this will come over top

240
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240

 

241
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,430

like so

242
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440

 

243
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,950

this will be all wood

244
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960

 

245
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,189

and i'll probably make this glowstone

246
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199

 

247
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,550

just like the other door

248
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560

 

249
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,029

okay yeah this is uh this is going to be

250
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
okay yeah this is uh this is going to be
 

251
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,950
okay yeah this is uh this is going to be
a mirror of the other side there too

252
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
a mirror of the other side there too
 

253
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,189
a mirror of the other side there too
you got the redstone over there

254
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199

 

255
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,790

so these are special little chambers

256
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
so these are special little chambers
 

257
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,629
so these are special little chambers
these things here

258
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
these things here
 

259
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,230
these things here
not gonna tell you what they're for just

260
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
not gonna tell you what they're for just
 

261
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,830
not gonna tell you what they're for just
yet you might have figured it out

262
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
yet you might have figured it out
 

263
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,909
yet you might have figured it out
already

264
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919

 

265
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,909

all right i like you when building those

266
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
all right i like you when building those
 

267
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,550
all right i like you when building those
quick like this

268
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560

 

269
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,629

oops i really don't mind using that

270
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
oops i really don't mind using that
 

271
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,590
oops i really don't mind using that
stone bricks

272
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
stone bricks
 

273
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,590
stone bricks
like as filler blocks anymore because i

274
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
like as filler blocks anymore because i
 

275
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,070
like as filler blocks anymore because i
have all those blaze rods so

276
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
have all those blaze rods so
 

277
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,749
have all those blaze rods so
it doesn't really cost me anything to

278
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
it doesn't really cost me anything to
 

279
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,189
it doesn't really cost me anything to
convert like

280
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
convert like
 

281
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,629
convert like
cobblestone into stone bricks so

282
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
cobblestone into stone bricks so
 

283
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,230
cobblestone into stone bricks so
if i ever have to fill holes sometimes

284
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
if i ever have to fill holes sometimes
 

285
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,909
if i ever have to fill holes sometimes
i'll use these even

286
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
i'll use these even
 

287
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,029
i'll use these even
just because it doesn't bother me

288
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039

 

289
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,150

okay

290
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160

 

291
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,270

that's roughly correct

292
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
that's roughly correct
 

293
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
that's roughly correct
and i the reason i was concerned about

294
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
and i the reason i was concerned about
 

295
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,110
and i the reason i was concerned about
this door here is i don't want to

296
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
this door here is i don't want to
 

297
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,830
this door here is i don't want to
really extend this any water like i

298
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
really extend this any water like i
 

299
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,029
really extend this any water like i
would have to be

300
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
would have to be
 

301
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,950
would have to be
two blocks wider if i put the redstone

302
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
two blocks wider if i put the redstone
 

303
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,070
two blocks wider if i put the redstone
behind the pistons like i normally do

304
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
behind the pistons like i normally do
 

305
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,950
behind the pistons like i normally do
but this is getting really close to the

306
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
but this is getting really close to the
 

307
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,309
but this is getting really close to the
tree farm below

308
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
tree farm below
 

309
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,390
tree farm below
and this tree farm is not complete

310
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
and this tree farm is not complete
 

311
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,029
and this tree farm is not complete
either it will probably still extend out

312
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
either it will probably still extend out
 

313
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,150
either it will probably still extend out
like at least up to here if i was to

314
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
like at least up to here if i was to
 

315
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,110
like at least up to here if i was to
guess which is

316
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
guess which is
 

317
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,950
guess which is
getting really close to this thing up

318
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
getting really close to this thing up
 

319
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,189
getting really close to this thing up
here

320
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
here
 

321
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,029
here
and they might interfere if i'm not

322
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
and they might interfere if i'm not
 

323
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,749
and they might interfere if i'm not
careful

324
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759

 

325
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,150

okay sweet let me do some more stuff off

326
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
okay sweet let me do some more stuff off
 

327
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,430
okay sweet let me do some more stuff off
camera and we will

328
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
camera and we will
 

329
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,029
camera and we will
get the show on the road

330
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039

 

331
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,550

yeah so for these window things i went

332
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
yeah so for these window things i went
 

333
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,550
yeah so for these window things i went
inside each of them and i dug

334
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
inside each of them and i dug
 

335
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,430
inside each of them and i dug
uh up to the surface actually went up

336
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
uh up to the surface actually went up
 

337
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,309
uh up to the surface actually went up
the surface

338
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
the surface
 

339
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,350
the surface
and dug down to be technically correct

340
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360

 

341
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,189

i'm going to leave the top uncovered so

342
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
i'm going to leave the top uncovered so
 

343
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,629
i'm going to leave the top uncovered so
you can see the rain falling down like

344
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
you can see the rain falling down like
 

345
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:58,950
you can see the rain falling down like
this

346
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
this
 

347
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,230
this
i like that and i'm just going to go up

348
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
i like that and i'm just going to go up
 

349
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,869
i like that and i'm just going to go up
all these

350
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
all these
 

351
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,790
all these

just to polish it up i got iron on the

356
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
just to polish it up i got iron on the
 

357
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,150
just to polish it up i got iron on the
door now i'm

358
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
door now i'm
 

359
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,749
door now i'm
i'll show you really quick how the

360
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
i'll show you really quick how the
 

361
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,430
i'll show you really quick how the
wiring is

362
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
wiring is
 

363
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,790
wiring is
i think i'm going to leave this door

364
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
i think i'm going to leave this door
 

365
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
i think i'm going to leave this door
very very simple

366
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
very very simple
 

367
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,230
very very simple
so all it is right now you got the

368
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
so all it is right now you got the
 

369
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,309
so all it is right now you got the
piston here and the one below it

370
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
piston here and the one below it
 

371
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,589
piston here and the one below it
redstone wire

372
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
redstone wire
 

373
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,110
redstone wire
next to it then block

374
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
next to it then block
 

375
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,389
next to it then block
redstone torch another block

376
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
redstone torch another block
 

377
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,790
redstone torch another block
and then exact same on this side

378
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
and then exact same on this side
 

379
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,350
and then exact same on this side
wire runs between the two redstone

380
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
wire runs between the two redstone
 

381
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,389
wire runs between the two redstone
torches and that's how you

382
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
torches and that's how you
 

383
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,750
torches and that's how you
can open and close the door

384
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760

 

385
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,350

so i'll probably just run a lever i

386
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
so i'll probably just run a lever i
 

387
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,870
so i'll probably just run a lever i
think i'll just have one lever on this

388
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
think i'll just have one lever on this
 

389
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,310
think i'll just have one lever on this
side of the door

390
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
side of the door
 

391
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,310
side of the door
to open and close the door

392
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
