how's it going still working on the
blaze farm here I'm going to have to

6
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:15,509
blaze farm here I'm going to have to
 

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,170
blaze farm here I'm going to have to
deactivate it again so I have to hop in

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,180
deactivate it again so I have to hop in
 

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,859
deactivate it again so I have to hop in
quickly place blocks as fast as possible

10
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:21,869
quickly place blocks as fast as possible
 

11
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,779
quickly place blocks as fast as possible
without dying and before they all spawn

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:28,789

 

13
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:35,150

23
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,729

okay gonna have to come up with a better

24
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:00,739
okay gonna have to come up with a better
 

25
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,640
okay gonna have to come up with a better
plan the new plan I dug out all around

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,650
plan the new plan I dug out all around
 

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,060
plan the new plan I dug out all around
the sides of it so I'm going to run in

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,070
the sides of it so I'm going to run in
 

29
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,609
the sides of it so I'm going to run in
there should be no no blaze there at the

30
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:12,619
there should be no no blaze there at the
 

31
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,030
there should be no no blaze there at the
moment

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040

 

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,770

and I'm gonna have to try quickly place

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:20,780
and I'm gonna have to try quickly place
 

35
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,249
and I'm gonna have to try quickly place
it this way the best I can go all the

36
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:27,259
it this way the best I can go all the
 

37
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:37,710
it this way the best I can go all the
way around might take a little while

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:37,720

 

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,820

but yeah so I'm going to do and I'll see

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:42,830
but yeah so I'm going to do and I'll see
 

41

you in a little bit I did manage to
 

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,740
you in a little bit I did manage to
deactivate it so that was fun I'm gonna

44
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:53,750
deactivate it so that was fun I'm gonna
 

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,930
deactivate it so that was fun I'm gonna
make a few changes in here I'm gonna rid

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:55,940
make a few changes in here I'm gonna rid
 

47
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,750
make a few changes in here I'm gonna rid
of these corner pistons and pressure

48
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:58,760
of these corner pistons and pressure
 

49
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,070
of these corner pistons and pressure
plates because occasionally at this one

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,080
plates because occasionally at this one
 

51
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,070
plates because occasionally at this one
will you will push the blaze and then

52
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,080
will you will push the blaze and then
 

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,620
will you will push the blaze and then
this one extends to sometimes when that

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:08,630
this one extends to sometimes when that
 

55
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,749
this one extends to sometimes when that
happens they take some suffocation

56
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,759
happens they take some suffocation
 

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,449
happens they take some suffocation
damage and we don't want that happening

58
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:13,459
damage and we don't want that happening
 

59
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,250
damage and we don't want that happening
so I'm just going to get rid of all the

60
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,260
so I'm just going to get rid of all the
 

61
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,930
so I'm just going to get rid of all the
corner ones and I'm also going to add a

62
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:18,940
corner ones and I'm also going to add a
 

63
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,150
corner ones and I'm also going to add a
deactivation thing for the spawner so

64
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
deactivation thing for the spawner so
 

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,930
deactivation thing for the spawner so
I'm going to pour lava down in here in

66
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:24,940
I'm going to pour lava down in here in
 

67
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm going to pour lava down in here in
these corners and that will pretty much

68
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:30,920
these corners and that will pretty much
 

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,610
these corners and that will pretty much
get get rid of all the blaze spawning

70
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:33,620
get get rid of all the blaze spawning
 

71
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,360
get get rid of all the blaze spawning
cuz if you have lava pouring down here

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,370
cuz if you have lava pouring down here
 

73
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,940
cuz if you have lava pouring down here
that will be light level 15 this will be

74
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:39,950
that will be light level 15 this will be
 

75
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,870
that will be light level 15 this will be
14 this will be 13 blaze need light

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:43,880
14 this will be 13 blaze need light
 

77
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,640
14 this will be 13 blaze need light
level 12 or lower to spawn so pretty

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:48,650
level 12 or lower to spawn so pretty
 

79
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,620
level 12 or lower to spawn so pretty
much this whole place will be bright

80
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,630
much this whole place will be bright
 

81
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,990
much this whole place will be bright
enough that they won't if I if I drop

82
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,000
enough that they won't if I if I drop
 

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,030
enough that they won't if I if I drop
lava here here here here here here here

84
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,040
lava here here here here here here here
 

85
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,830
lava here here here here here here here
and here

86
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
and here
 

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,930
and here
then I'll need maybe some on the sides

88
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:01,940
then I'll need maybe some on the sides
 

89
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,039
then I'll need maybe some on the sides
the four sides here as well and the nice

90
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,049
the four sides here as well and the nice
 

91
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:07,660
the four sides here as well and the nice
thing is these pressure plates will keep

92
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:07,670
thing is these pressure plates will keep
 

93
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,690
thing is these pressure plates will keep
the lava from flowing down will hold it

94
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:10,700
the lava from flowing down will hold it
 

95
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,930
the lava from flowing down will hold it
in place so that's what I'm going to do

96
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:13,940
in place so that's what I'm going to do
 

97
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,670
in place so that's what I'm going to do
I'll be back in a little bit

98
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680

 

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,250

well I got lots to show you now make

100
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,260
well I got lots to show you now make
 

101
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,840
well I got lots to show you now make
those changes our ice cream cone has a

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:25,850
those changes our ice cream cone has a
 

103
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,890
those changes our ice cream cone has a
drizzle of hot fudge in it now looks

104
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:29,900
drizzle of hot fudge in it now looks
 

105
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,620
drizzle of hot fudge in it now looks
pretty cool I'd say it seems to

106
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,630
pretty cool I'd say it seems to
 

107
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,449
pretty cool I'd say it seems to
deactivate the blaze spawning completely

108
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:36,459
deactivate the blaze spawning completely
 

109
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,050
deactivate the blaze spawning completely
which is really confusing me because as

110
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,060
which is really confusing me because as
 

111
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,080
which is really confusing me because as
far as I know there are

112
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,090
far as I know there are
 

113
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,720
far as I know there are
there should be 24 blocks in there at

114
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:47,730
there should be 24 blocks in there at
 

115
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,500
there should be 24 blocks in there at
light level 12 which I've tested this a

116
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,510
light level 12 which I've tested this a
 

117
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,670
light level 12 which I've tested this a
few patches ago and please we're only

118
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
few patches ago and please we're only
 

119
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,369
few patches ago and please we're only
able to spawn at light level 12 or lower

120
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:58,379
able to spawn at light level 12 or lower
 

121
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,390
able to spawn at light level 12 or lower
so they should be able to spawn in here

122
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,400
so they should be able to spawn in here
 

123
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,660
so they should be able to spawn in here
but they're not so maybe something

124
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:05,670
but they're not so maybe something
 

125
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,319
but they're not so maybe something
changed in the patches they don't seem

126
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,329
changed in the patches they don't seem
 

127
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,690
changed in the patches they don't seem
to be spawning at light level 12 like I

128
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,700
to be spawning at light level 12 like I
 

129
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,729
to be spawning at light level 12 like I
thought they would which is a good thing

130
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:13,739
thought they would which is a good thing
 

131
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,199
thought they would which is a good thing
for me that means I don't need to put

132
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,209
for me that means I don't need to put
 

133
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,189
for me that means I don't need to put
lava down the sides which is nice this

134
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
lava down the sides which is nice this
 

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,159
lava down the sides which is nice this
is a this is a switch thing here to turn

136
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:22,169
is a this is a switch thing here to turn
 

137
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,659
is a this is a switch thing here to turn
the lab on or off we've got two lava

138
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:26,669
the lab on or off we've got two lava
 

139
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,390
the lab on or off we've got two lava
underneath each of these and so a piston

140
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,400
underneath each of these and so a piston
 

141
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,210
underneath each of these and so a piston
sticky piston here will push a block to

142
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
sticky piston here will push a block to
 

143
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,510
sticky piston here will push a block to
block it off or if it's open like it is

144
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
block it off or if it's open like it is
 

145
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,469
block it off or if it's open like it is
right now there's two holes and it'll

146
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
right now there's two holes and it'll
 

147
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,820
right now there's two holes and it'll
pour down below let's let's check it out

148
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:48,830
pour down below let's let's check it out
 

149
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,770
pour down below let's let's check it out
where's that link right so lava

150
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:54,780
where's that link right so lava
 

151
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,050
where's that link right so lava
disappears pretty quick I tried really

152
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,060
disappears pretty quick I tried really
 

153
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,930
disappears pretty quick I tried really
hard to make sure that would happen now

154
00:04:59,930 --> 00:04:59,940
hard to make sure that would happen now
 

155
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,270
hard to make sure that would happen now
yeah spawning no problem now

156
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,280
yeah spawning no problem now
 

157
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,159
yeah spawning no problem now
maybe I'll just turn this back on before

158
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:07,169
maybe I'll just turn this back on before
 

159
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,909
maybe I'll just turn this back on before
we have some problems that works really

160
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
we have some problems that works really
 

161
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,999
we have some problems that works really
well happy about that pretty sure lava

162
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,009
well happy about that pretty sure lava
 

163
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,430
well happy about that pretty sure lava
doesn't kill these guys but maybe it

164
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
doesn't kill these guys but maybe it
 

165
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,190
doesn't kill these guys but maybe it
will suffocate them I don't know

166
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,200

 

167
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,250

get rid of him yes so this is what it

168
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:37,260
get rid of him yes so this is what it
 

169
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,890
get rid of him yes so this is what it
looks like on the inside

170
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:41,900

 

171
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,700

so lava pours down there and it's held

172
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:46,710
so lava pours down there and it's held
 

173
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,120
so lava pours down there and it's held
in place by the pressure plates and same

174
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,130
in place by the pressure plates and same
 

175
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,490
in place by the pressure plates and same
with over here that's where the other

176
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:52,500
with over here that's where the other
 

177
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,750
with over here that's where the other
lava ends got one glass block above the

178
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:56,760
lava ends got one glass block above the
 

179
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,180
lava ends got one glass block above the
spawner there so that will spawn above

180
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,190
spawner there so that will spawn above
 

181
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,050
spawner there so that will spawn above
it so nice feature to have that the

182
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,060
it so nice feature to have that the
 

183
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,530
it so nice feature to have that the
deactivating thing both for building it

184
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:09,540
deactivating thing both for building it
 

185
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,790
deactivating thing both for building it
and when it's all done you know it'll be

186
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
and when it's all done you know it'll be
 

187
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,140
and when it's all done you know it'll be
handy to be able to shut it off and

188
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,150
handy to be able to shut it off and
 

189
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,440
handy to be able to shut it off and
chase you're annoying me or you know if

190
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,450
chase you're annoying me or you know if
 

191
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,450
chase you're annoying me or you know if
I don't want blaze spawning because they

192
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
I don't want blaze spawning because they
 

193
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,020
I don't want blaze spawning because they
do like the game considerably because of

194
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,030
do like the game considerably because of
 

195
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,640
do like the game considerably because of
all the particles and stuff I've noticed

196
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,650
all the particles and stuff I've noticed
 

197
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,150
all the particles and stuff I've noticed
so next up we got to work on the crusher

198
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,160
so next up we got to work on the crusher
 

199
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,370
so next up we got to work on the crusher
then when that's all said and done we

200
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:34,380
then when that's all said and done we
 

201
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,480
then when that's all said and done we
need to look make this look nicer but

202
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,490
need to look make this look nicer but
 

203
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,040
need to look make this look nicer but
it's going it's going pretty good

204
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,050
it's going it's going pretty good
 

205
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,570
it's going it's going pretty good
it's a big project what went smoother if

206
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:44,580
it's a big project what went smoother if
 

207
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,140
it's a big project what went smoother if
I did more in creative mode like the

208
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,150
I did more in creative mode like the
 

209
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,070
I did more in creative mode like the
practice building at first but you know

210
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
practice building at first but you know
 

211
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,630
practice building at first but you know
it's more fun if you don't know exactly

212
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:53,640
it's more fun if you don't know exactly
 

213
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,760
it's more fun if you don't know exactly
what you're doing it is also I should

214
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:58,770
what you're doing it is also I should
 

215
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,850
what you're doing it is also I should
mention that with with this lava here I

216
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:01,860
mention that with with this lava here I
 

217
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,370
mention that with with this lava here I
have solid blocks on all six sides of it

218
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
have solid blocks on all six sides of it
 

219
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,370
have solid blocks on all six sides of it
when it shut off so that lavas above

220
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,380
when it shut off so that lavas above
 

221
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,100
when it shut off so that lavas above
this block here so there's there's block

222
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,110
this block here so there's there's block
 

223
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,810
this block here so there's there's block
below there's a block above and on all

224
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:14,820
below there's a block above and on all
 

225
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,620
below there's a block above and on all
four sides

226
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:16,630
four sides
 

227
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,740
four sides
and that makes sure that no light leaks

228
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:19,750
and that makes sure that no light leaks
 

229
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,260
and that makes sure that no light leaks
down to the spawning area below which

230
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,270
down to the spawning area below which
 

231
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,060
down to the spawning area below which
would lower spawning rates that's really

232
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,070
would lower spawning rates that's really
 

233
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:34,770
would lower spawning rates that's really
important all right so the next problem

234
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:34,780
important all right so the next problem
 

235
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,200
important all right so the next problem
we have to deal with is the fact that

236
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,210
we have to deal with is the fact that
 

237
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,120
we have to deal with is the fact that
these pressure plates are activating our

238
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,130
these pressure plates are activating our
 

239
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,450
these pressure plates are activating our
holding system system below we don't

240
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,460
holding system system below we don't
 

241
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,190
holding system system below we don't
want that happening so I think the best

242
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,200
want that happening so I think the best
 

243
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,010
want that happening so I think the best
way of dealing with that is just to

244
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,020
way of dealing with that is just to
 

245
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,690
way of dealing with that is just to
lower everything one more block for the

246
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:54,700
lower everything one more block for the
 

247
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,800
lower everything one more block for the
crushing system so the holder will be

248
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:58,810
crushing system so the holder will be
 

249
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,060
crushing system so the holder will be
here then at this level that will give

250
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,070
here then at this level that will give
 

251
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,490
here then at this level that will give
the the blaze two blocks here to fall

252
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,500
the the blaze two blocks here to fall
 

253
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,060
the the blaze two blocks here to fall
into and now has an extra benefit of

254
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,070
into and now has an extra benefit of
 

255
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,060
into and now has an extra benefit of
them not being able to jump out and walk

256
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,070
them not being able to jump out and walk
 

257
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,280
them not being able to jump out and walk
around on these pressure plates when

258
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,290
around on these pressure plates when
 

259
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,800
around on these pressure plates when
they're being held which would get

260
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:16,810
they're being held which would get
 

261
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,940
they're being held which would get
annoying downside is we have to go down

262
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:20,950
annoying downside is we have to go down
 

263
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,720
annoying downside is we have to go down
one more block which will take make us a

264
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:24,730
one more block which will take make us a
 

265
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,330
one more block which will take make us a
little bit further away from the spawner

266
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:26,340
little bit further away from the spawner
 

267
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,910
little bit further away from the spawner
but we're still able to be within range

268
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:29,920
but we're still able to be within range
 

269
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:37,070
but we're still able to be within range
of it yeah so I lowered this one block I

270
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,080
of it yeah so I lowered this one block I
 

271
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
of it yeah so I lowered this one block I
also replaced these corners with glass

272
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,090
also replaced these corners with glass
 

273
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,760
also replaced these corners with glass
just that I thought it would look cooler

274
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:41,770
just that I thought it would look cooler
 

275
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,940
just that I thought it would look cooler
you can see the lava through it we're

276
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:44,950
you can see the lava through it we're
 

277
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,040
you can see the lava through it we're
going to position the pistons now so

278
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,050
going to position the pistons now so
 

279
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,650
going to position the pistons now so
this will go down one I might change

280
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:52,660
this will go down one I might change
 

281
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
this will go down one I might change
this though I don't know if I'm own if

282
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,670
this though I don't know if I'm own if
 

283
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,910
this though I don't know if I'm own if
I'm going to use glass or not in the end

284
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920

 

285
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:06,200

hmm yeah some pistons will go not there

286
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,210
hmm yeah some pistons will go not there
 

287
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,640
hmm yeah some pistons will go not there
first for the holding system I wanted

288
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,650
first for the holding system I wanted
 

289
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,110
first for the holding system I wanted
them like this over there

290
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,120

 

291
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,679

so they'll be one here and one here then

292
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:20,689
so they'll be one here and one here then
 

293
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:28,590
so they'll be one here and one here then
on the they'll be two over on the side

294
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600

 

295
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,470

like that so when they are all extended

296
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
like that so when they are all extended
 

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,819
like that so when they are all extended
the blaze won't be able to fall down

298
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:36,829
the blaze won't be able to fall down
 

299
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,590
the blaze won't be able to fall down
here okay so I'm going to look glass all

300
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
here okay so I'm going to look glass all
 

301
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,910
here okay so I'm going to look glass all
around I feel like I've been very

302
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,920
around I feel like I've been very
 

303
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,559
around I feel like I've been very
serious ever since I got to the nether

304
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:44,569
serious ever since I got to the nether
 

305
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:49,090
serious ever since I got to the nether
you know I don't know this is serious

306
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,100
you know I don't know this is serious
 

307
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,019
you know I don't know this is serious
business I guess dying all the time

308
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:55,029
business I guess dying all the time
 

309
00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:01,540
business I guess dying all the time
put me in serious mood okay so next

310
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:01,550
put me in serious mood okay so next
 

311
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,470
put me in serious mood okay so next
we'll do crusher and I wanted for sure

312
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,480
we'll do crusher and I wanted for sure
 

313
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,230
we'll do crusher and I wanted for sure
two Pistons in the back there I think

314
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
two Pistons in the back there I think
 

315
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,350
two Pistons in the back there I think
that's the right position we have to use

316
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
that's the right position we have to use
 

317
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,629
that's the right position we have to use
solid blocks we can't use glass for that

318
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:16,639
solid blocks we can't use glass for that
 

319
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,819
solid blocks we can't use glass for that
because a glass won't suffocate them and

320
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:20,829
because a glass won't suffocate them and
 

321
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:26,850
because a glass won't suffocate them and
then the other Pistons will go here

322
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:26,860

 

323
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,559

remember I I offset them diagonally

324
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:29,569
remember I I offset them diagonally
 

325
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:32,860
remember I I offset them diagonally
because I was having that issue with the

326
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:32,870
because I was having that issue with the
 

327
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,549
because I was having that issue with the
bottom piston not being able to retract

328
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:35,559
bottom piston not being able to retract
 

329
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,319
bottom piston not being able to retract
so that's important another one when we

330
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:41,329
so that's important another one when we
 

331
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,369
so that's important another one when we
go over here like so

332
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:47,379
go over here like so
 

333
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,369
go over here like so
and so these two will get pushed forward

334
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:51,379
and so these two will get pushed forward
 

335
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,189
and so these two will get pushed forward
first which will bring the blaze to

336
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:54,199
first which will bring the blaze to
 

337
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,619
first which will bring the blaze to
these one either of these two blocks

338
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:56,629
these one either of these two blocks
 

339
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,150
these one either of these two blocks
here and then they'll get crushed by

340
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
here and then they'll get crushed by
 

341
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,340
here and then they'll get crushed by
these two and I'll be right over here

342
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,350
these two and I'll be right over here
 

343
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,019
these two and I'll be right over here
being able to hit their feet and collect

344
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:05,029
being able to hit their feet and collect
 

345
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:10,210
being able to hit their feet and collect
their drops is the plan okay now we just

346
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,220
their drops is the plan okay now we just
 

347
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,009
their drops is the plan okay now we just
got to do the wiring for all this

348
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:14,019
got to do the wiring for all this
 

349
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,309
got to do the wiring for all this
awesome got the wiring done finally took

350
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:18,319
awesome got the wiring done finally took
 

351
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,820
awesome got the wiring done finally took
me took me a good hour anyway

352
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:21,830
me took me a good hour anyway
 

353
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,820
me took me a good hour anyway
it's kind of complicated I'll run you

354
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:24,830
it's kind of complicated I'll run you
 

355
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,220
it's kind of complicated I'll run you
through it pretty soon first let's see

356
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,230
through it pretty soon first let's see
 

357
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,639
through it pretty soon first let's see
it in action here we got we got the two

358
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:30,649
it in action here we got we got the two
 

359
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,370
it in action here we got we got the two
buttons like I wanted and the lever this

360
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:33,380
buttons like I wanted and the lever this
 

361
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,780
buttons like I wanted and the lever this
turns the blade spawning on or off this

362
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:37,790
turns the blade spawning on or off this
 

363
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,269
turns the blade spawning on or off this
button activates the crusher and this

364
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279
button activates the crusher and this
 

365
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,280
button activates the crusher and this
one opens the the gate or whatever once

366
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,290
one opens the the gate or whatever once
 

367
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,340
one opens the the gate or whatever once
we collect our blaze rods and stuff you

368
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,350
we collect our blaze rods and stuff you
 

369
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,769
we collect our blaze rods and stuff you
can see they fall down and while while

370
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:53,779
can see they fall down and while while
 

371
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,480
can see they fall down and while while
it's closed they're able to collect

372
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,490
it's closed they're able to collect
 

373
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:02,920
it's closed they're able to collect
above there and it's not perfect but

374
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:02,930
above there and it's not perfect but
 

375
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:10,509
above there and it's not perfect but
it's working pretty good some a few do

376
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:10,519
it's working pretty good some a few do
 

377
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:18,449
it's working pretty good some a few do
die not really sure how to correct that

378
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:18,459

 

379
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,009

you can walk up and click there drops

380
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:21,019
you can walk up and click there drops
 

381
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,390
you can walk up and click there drops
and see they're collecting above there

382
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,400
and see they're collecting above there
 

383
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,760
and see they're collecting above there
and yeah so I'm gonna shut this off so

384
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:32,770
and yeah so I'm gonna shut this off so
 

385
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,120
and yeah so I'm gonna shut this off so
that we can see it see the lava starting

386
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,130
that we can see it see the lava starting
 

387
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,410
that we can see it see the lava starting
to flow down

388
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:40,420

 

389
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,610

see it one more time

390
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:44,620

 

391
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:54,610

pretty awesome I like it

392
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:54,620

 

393
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,260

one hit kills get lots of XP from it

394
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,270
one hit kills get lots of XP from it
 

395
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,050
one hit kills get lots of XP from it
I've made tons of blaze rods more than

396
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,060
I've made tons of blaze rods more than
 

397
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,800
I've made tons of blaze rods more than
I'll ever need okay I'm going to get rid

398
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:05,810
I'll ever need okay I'm going to get rid
 

399
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,140
I'll ever need okay I'm going to get rid
of these last you guys and we'll run

400
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,150
of these last you guys and we'll run
 

401
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,490
of these last you guys and we'll run
through the wiring yeah so a lot of this

402
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,500
through the wiring yeah so a lot of this
 

403
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,380
through the wiring yeah so a lot of this
wiring and stuff I should be able to

404
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,390
wiring and stuff I should be able to
 

405
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,720
wiring and stuff I should be able to
hide pretty good once I publish this

406
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:16,730
hide pretty good once I publish this
 

407
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,900
hide pretty good once I publish this
area up and hide it all behind walls or

408
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:19,910
area up and hide it all behind walls or
 

409
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,650
area up and hide it all behind walls or
under floors

410
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:20,660
under floors
 

411
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,280
under floors
I actually made an effort to put all

412
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,290
I actually made an effort to put all
 

413
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,520
I actually made an effort to put all
this stuff down low so I could put a

414
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:27,530
this stuff down low so I could put a
 

415
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,760
this stuff down low so I could put a
floor up a floor over top of it easily

416
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:29,770
floor up a floor over top of it easily
 

417
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,250
floor up a floor over top of it easily
so that's not a problem let's look at

418
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,260
so that's not a problem let's look at
 

419
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,490
so that's not a problem let's look at
this lever here first I guess this turns

420
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:36,500
this lever here first I guess this turns
 

421
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,460
this lever here first I guess this turns
the lava on or off which turns the blaze

422
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:39,470
the lava on or off which turns the blaze
 

423
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,570
the lava on or off which turns the blaze
spawning on or off this just has wire

424
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:43,580
spawning on or off this just has wire
 

425
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,880
spawning on or off this just has wire
goes to this block there's a redstone

426
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:45,890
goes to this block there's a redstone
 

427
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,860
goes to this block there's a redstone
torch there which goes up and then this

428
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:49,870
torch there which goes up and then this
 

429
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,170
torch there which goes up and then this
it's a vertical column of torches all

430
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,180
it's a vertical column of torches all
 

431
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,030
it's a vertical column of torches all
the way up to the top there and that

432
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,040
the way up to the top there and that
 

433
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,850
the way up to the top there and that
goes up to the lab a thing we built

434
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:00,860
goes up to the lab a thing we built
 

435
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,610
goes up to the lab a thing we built
earlier that was this episode I don't

436
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:03,620
earlier that was this episode I don't
 

437
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,920
earlier that was this episode I don't
even know yeah so let's torches come all

438
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:08,930
even know yeah so let's torches come all
 

439
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:14,830
even know yeah so let's torches come all
the way up here up to here powers this

440
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:14,840
the way up here up to here powers this
 

441
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,330
the way up here up to here powers this
block this wire goes to repeater which

442
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,340
block this wire goes to repeater which
 

443
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,540
block this wire goes to repeater which
sends the power through this block and

444
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:22,550
sends the power through this block and
 

445
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,140
sends the power through this block and
then powers all four Pistons so that's

446
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,150
then powers all four Pistons so that's
 

447
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,510
then powers all four Pistons so that's
how the lava turns on and off and we've

448
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:31,520
how the lava turns on and off and we've
 

449
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,670
how the lava turns on and off and we've
we've looked in that at that already

450
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
we've looked in that at that already
 

451
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:43,620
we've looked in that at that already
before okay now the fun parts um-hmm

452
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,630
before okay now the fun parts um-hmm
 

453
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,600
before okay now the fun parts um-hmm
yeah I guess before you build a redstone

454
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,610
yeah I guess before you build a redstone
 

455
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,130
yeah I guess before you build a redstone
project like this that's fairly

456
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,140
project like this that's fairly
 

457
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,260
project like this that's fairly
complicated it's good to figure out

458
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,270
complicated it's good to figure out
 

459
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,900
complicated it's good to figure out
exactly what needs to happen in your

460
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:52,910
exactly what needs to happen in your
 

461
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,420
exactly what needs to happen in your
head first before you start laying down

462
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,430
head first before you start laying down
 

463
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,410
head first before you start laying down
wire so with this I knew I needed these

464
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,420
wire so with this I knew I needed these
 

465
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,540
wire so with this I knew I needed these
four last blocks to come together so

466
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,550
four last blocks to come together so
 

467
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,380
four last blocks to come together so
that it would hold the blaze above and

468
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,390
that it would hold the blaze above and
 

469
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,170
that it would hold the blaze above and
then I realized I need these four

470
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:08,180
then I realized I need these four
 

471
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,870
then I realized I need these four
Vox to come forward as well to push the

472
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
Vox to come forward as well to push the
 

473
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,660
Vox to come forward as well to push the
plays closer so that I'll be able to

474
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,670
plays closer so that I'll be able to
 

475
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,820
plays closer so that I'll be able to
pick up their rods because if the rod

476
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:15,830
pick up their rods because if the rod
 

477
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,100
pick up their rods because if the rod
lands back here I can't grab it from

478
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,110
lands back here I can't grab it from
 

479
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,680
lands back here I can't grab it from
here so that's why I need them to come

480
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:20,690
here so that's why I need them to come
 

481
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,570
here so that's why I need them to come
forward I could have just made them drop

482
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:22,580
forward I could have just made them drop
 

483
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,440
forward I could have just made them drop
down on one by one tube as well and then

484
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,450
down on one by one tube as well and then
 

485
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,300
down on one by one tube as well and then
I want to have that problem but I

486
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,310
I want to have that problem but I
 

487
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,220
I want to have that problem but I
thought it'd be cooler to have a 2x2

488
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,230
thought it'd be cooler to have a 2x2
 

489
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,639
thought it'd be cooler to have a 2x2
area to hold them and and it is haha

490
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:35,649
area to hold them and and it is haha
 

491
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,699
area to hold them and and it is haha
okay yeah so figure out exactly what you

492
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:39,709
okay yeah so figure out exactly what you
 

493
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,960
okay yeah so figure out exactly what you
need to happen yeah they come forward

494
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:43,970
need to happen yeah they come forward
 

495
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,320
need to happen yeah they come forward
and then the crushers here and here

496
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,330
and then the crushers here and here
 

497
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,300
and then the crushers here and here
squish them for a certain amount of time

498
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,310
squish them for a certain amount of time
 

499
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:56,050
squish them for a certain amount of time
and then they're released and he hit

500
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,060
and then they're released and he hit
 

501
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,320
and then they're released and he hit
them blaze rods drop you don't want this

502
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,330
them blaze rods drop you don't want this
 

503
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,610
them blaze rods drop you don't want this
to open up yet because you don't want to

504
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:02,620
to open up yet because you don't want to
 

505
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,920
to open up yet because you don't want to
full health blaze mixing in with the one

506
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:05,930
full health blaze mixing in with the one
 

507
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,590
full health blaze mixing in with the one
hit health blaze and also you don't want

508
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:08,600
hit health blaze and also you don't want
 

509
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,260
hit health blaze and also you don't want
them here when you're collecting the

510
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,270
them here when you're collecting the
 

511
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,940
them here when you're collecting the
rods because they can attack you so and

512
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:15,950
rods because they can attack you so and
 

513
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,920
rods because they can attack you so and
you hit that and it releases everything

514
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:17,930
you hit that and it releases everything
 

515
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:24,040
you hit that and it releases everything
back to normal so there's basically two

516
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,050
back to normal so there's basically two
 

517
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,199
back to normal so there's basically two
groups of Pistons on this thing there's

518
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:26,209
groups of Pistons on this thing there's
 

519
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:30,610
groups of Pistons on this thing there's
there's a four glass blocks and then the

520
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:30,620
there's a four glass blocks and then the
 

521
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,560
there's a four glass blocks and then the
back wall they're all eight of those

522
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:32,570
back wall they're all eight of those
 

523
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,230
back wall they're all eight of those
Pistons are connected together on the

524
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,240
Pistons are connected together on the
 

525
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Pistons are connected together on the
same wire and then there's also the -

526
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:37,850
same wire and then there's also the -
 

527
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,710
same wire and then there's also the -
crusher Pistons is the second group and

528
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
crusher Pistons is the second group and
 

529
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,060
crusher Pistons is the second group and
they're being powered from below here

530
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,070
they're being powered from below here
 

531
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,180
they're being powered from below here
there's a redstone torch and they're

532
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,190
there's a redstone torch and they're
 

533
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,490
there's a redstone torch and they're
connected by this wire down here the

534
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,500
connected by this wire down here the
 

535
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,000
connected by this wire down here the
first group though the gate one with the

536
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,010
first group though the gate one with the
 

537
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,010
first group though the gate one with the
eight Pistons is being controlled by

538
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,020
eight Pistons is being controlled by
 

539
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,620
eight Pistons is being controlled by
this wire here so there's one of them

540
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:02,630
this wire here so there's one of them
 

541
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,460
this wire here so there's one of them
one of the Pistons is over here and then

542
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,470
one of the Pistons is over here and then
 

543
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,970
one of the Pistons is over here and then
one of the front ones is over here it's

544
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:09,980
one of the front ones is over here it's
 

545
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,250
one of the front ones is over here it's
going to be really hard to show you the

546
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,260
going to be really hard to show you the
 

547
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,890
going to be really hard to show you the
wiring but eventually I'll put my world

548
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:14,900
wiring but eventually I'll put my world
 

549
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,620
wiring but eventually I'll put my world
up for download and if you want you can

550
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,630
up for download and if you want you can
 

551
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,240
up for download and if you want you can
check it out yourself in more detail

552
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,250
check it out yourself in more detail
 

553
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,520
check it out yourself in more detail
or I may make a tutorial in this as well

554
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,530
or I may make a tutorial in this as well
 

555
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,470
or I may make a tutorial in this as well
but yeah one of the Pistons is here for

556
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
but yeah one of the Pistons is here for
 

557
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,170
but yeah one of the Pistons is here for
the glass blocks one of the front ones

558
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,180
the glass blocks one of the front ones
 

559
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:37,560
the glass blocks one of the front ones
is over there this goes around goes down

560
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:37,570
is over there this goes around goes down
 

561
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,220
is over there this goes around goes down
here this is for the for a back wall

562
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,230
here this is for the for a back wall
 

563
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,280
here this is for the for a back wall
Pistons they're on a delay as well

564
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,290
Pistons they're on a delay as well
 

565
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,810
Pistons they're on a delay as well
because I wanted I want the glass blocks

566
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:48,820
because I wanted I want the glass blocks
 

567
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,150
because I wanted I want the glass blocks
to come together first and then have a

568
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,160
to come together first and then have a
 

569
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,550
to come together first and then have a
short delay before the back wall pushes

570
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:53,560
short delay before the back wall pushes
 

571
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,520
short delay before the back wall pushes
them because blaze need time to settle

572
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,530
them because blaze need time to settle
 

573
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,500
them because blaze need time to settle
down because they jump around and stuff

574
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,510
down because they jump around and stuff
 

575
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,490
down because they jump around and stuff
in there

576
00:17:59,490 --> 00:17:59,500
in there
 

577
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,980
in there
it's another one of the Pistons here and

578
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:03,990
it's another one of the Pistons here and
 

579
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,310
it's another one of the Pistons here and
then this one goes to a front one as

580
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
then this one goes to a front one as
 

581
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,510
then this one goes to a front one as
well these two also control the glass so

582
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,520
well these two also control the glass so
 

583
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,060
well these two also control the glass so
a couple things about this there are

584
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,070
a couple things about this there are
 

585
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,190
a couple things about this there are
pressure plates above here so I wasn't

586
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,200
pressure plates above here so I wasn't
 

587
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,560
pressure plates above here so I wasn't
able to have the wire one block higher

588
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,570
able to have the wire one block higher
 

589
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,490
able to have the wire one block higher
here because the blaze walking on the

590
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:26,500
here because the blaze walking on the
 

591
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
here because the blaze walking on the
pressure plates above were messing with

592
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,510
pressure plates above were messing with
 

593
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,650
pressure plates above were messing with
my pistons down here when I had it

594
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:31,660
my pistons down here when I had it
 

595
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,570
my pistons down here when I had it
higher so I lowered it all also I was

596
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:36,580
higher so I lowered it all also I was
 

597
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,460
higher so I lowered it all also I was
not able to run the wire straight across

598
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,470
not able to run the wire straight across
 

599
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,190
not able to run the wire straight across
here because of that piston glitch if

600
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
here because of that piston glitch if
 

601
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,380
here because of that piston glitch if
this if I had wire running above this

602
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,390
this if I had wire running above this
 

603
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,340
this if I had wire running above this
block here it would send power to this

604
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,350
block here it would send power to this
 

605
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,860
block here it would send power to this
crusher piston down here and I would not

606
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:49,870
crusher piston down here and I would not
 

607
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,520
crusher piston down here and I would not
be able to retract it like I need to

608
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,530

 

609
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,810

yeah so those are the two groups this

610
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:00,820
yeah so those are the two groups this
 

611
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,730
yeah so those are the two groups this
repeater here just makes it so I can

612
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:02,740
repeater here just makes it so I can
 

613
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,280
repeater here just makes it so I can
pull like the power is going this way so

614
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,290
pull like the power is going this way so
 

615
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,830
pull like the power is going this way so
it sends power to this block excuse me

616
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:10,840
it sends power to this block excuse me
 

617
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,380
it sends power to this block excuse me
to this block here and then the repeater

618
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,390
to this block here and then the repeater
 

619
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,660
to this block here and then the repeater
pulls the power from it just a little

620
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:18,670
pulls the power from it just a little
 

621
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,820
pulls the power from it just a little
little redstone trick okay oops

622
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:23,830
little redstone trick okay oops
 

623
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:31,840
little redstone trick okay oops
moving on okay so um I've tried

624
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:31,850
moving on okay so um I've tried
 

625
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,520
moving on okay so um I've tried
explaining this about three times now

626
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,530
explaining this about three times now
 

627
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,340
explaining this about three times now
this is my fourth fourth attempt

628
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,350
this is my fourth fourth attempt
 

629
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,370
this is my fourth fourth attempt
I just am having so much trouble

630
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:39,380
I just am having so much trouble
 

631
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,770
I just am having so much trouble
explaining this this is something you

632
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:41,780
explaining this this is something you
 

633
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,840
explaining this this is something you
kind of have to see on a graph or paper

634
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,850
kind of have to see on a graph or paper
 

635
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,279
kind of have to see on a graph or paper
you know it's pretty pretty complicated

636
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:48,289
you know it's pretty pretty complicated
 

637
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:52,510
you know it's pretty pretty complicated
to see how the wiring all works when you

638
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:52,520
to see how the wiring all works when you
 

639
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,010
to see how the wiring all works when you
press this button though I'm gonna try

640
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,020
press this button though I'm gonna try

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,840
again holds a power state right now you
can see it's off when I send power to

752
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:05,850
can see it's off when I send power to
 

753
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,330
can see it's off when I send power to
this bottom block here it switches this

754
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,340
this bottom block here it switches this
 

755
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,190
this bottom block here it switches this
to on so normally a button presses a

756
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
to on so normally a button presses a
 

757
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,690
to on so normally a button presses a
one-second pulse so when this this gets

758
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,700
one-second pulse so when this this gets
 

759
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,900
one-second pulse so when this this gets
switched on it stays on until it gets

760
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:20,910
switched on it stays on until it gets
 

761
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,030
switched on it stays on until it gets
shut off so the pulse is would be

762
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,040
shut off so the pulse is would be
 

763
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,669
shut off so the pulse is would be
infinite but it also branches off here

764
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:28,679
infinite but it also branches off here
 

765
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,909
infinite but it also branches off here

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,250
that's how you that's how we control the
 

773
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:48,590
that's how you that's how we control the
length of our pulse make sense yes no I

774
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:48,600
length of our pulse make sense yes no I
 

775
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,190
length of our pulse make sense yes no I
don't care yeah I explained it I did my

776
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,200
don't care yeah I explained it I did my
 

777
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,520
don't care yeah I explained it I did my
job

778
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,530
job
 

779
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,620

so I'm going to try polish this place up

782
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,210
so I'm going to try polish this place up
 

783
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,880
so I'm going to try polish this place up
and then I'm going to get get the heck

784
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:58,890
and then I'm going to get get the heck
 

785
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,080
and then I'm going to get get the heck
out of here because I'm sick of the

786
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,090
out of here because I'm sick of the
 

787
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,480
out of here because I'm sick of the
nether for right now it looks a little

788
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,490
nether for right now it looks a little
 

789
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,490
nether for right now it looks a little
bit better now that I got it all covered

790
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:07,500
bit better now that I got it all covered
 

791
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,539
bit better now that I got it all covered
up I have to do more tweaking and

792
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:11,549
up I have to do more tweaking and
 

793
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:13,760
up I have to do more tweaking and
polishing next time we're in the nether

794
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:13,770
polishing next time we're in the nether
 

795
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,210
polishing next time we're in the nether
uh-huh next time we build something I

796
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:17,220
uh-huh next time we build something I
 

797
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
uh-huh next time we build something I
did collect a little bit of nether wart

798
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,230
did collect a little bit of nether wart
 

799
