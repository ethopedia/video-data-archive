villagers here I was trying to figure

32
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,430
villagers here I was trying to figure
 

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,050
villagers here I was trying to figure
out what to do about that if I should

34
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,060
out what to do about that if I should
 

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,950
out what to do about that if I should
bring more or actually the easiest way

36
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:27,960
bring more or actually the easiest way
 

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,410
bring more or actually the easiest way
is probably just to feed them they're

38
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:30,420
is probably just to feed them they're
 

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,560
is probably just to feed them they're
probably really hungry and they should

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,570
probably really hungry and they should
 

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,870
probably really hungry and they should
make new villagers from that and then I

42
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880
make new villagers from that and then I
 

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,200
make new villagers from that and then I
don't have to do anything right because

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,210
don't have to do anything right because
 

45
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,780
don't have to do anything right because
this is a village because we have eight

I'm sure they'll do it in time I just

74
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:24,950
I'm sure they'll do it in time I just
 

75
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,100
I'm sure they'll do it in time I just
got to wait a little longer let me show

76
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,110
got to wait a little longer let me show

you guys what I've been up to I've been

78
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,300
you guys what I've been up to I've been
 

79
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,540
you guys what I've been up to I've been
working on that that eats road tunnel

80
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,550
working on that that eats road tunnel
 

81
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,940
working on that that eats road tunnel
and I think it's coming along pretty

82
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:33,950
and I think it's coming along pretty
 

83
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,770
and I think it's coming along pretty
good all right so it's just down here

84
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:38,780
good all right so it's just down here
 

85
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,760
good all right so it's just down here
and oh you know what we should try out

86
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:42,770
and oh you know what we should try out
 

87
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,940
and oh you know what we should try out
today maybe the rabbit farm here they

88
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:45,950
today maybe the rabbit farm here they
 

89
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,950
today maybe the rabbit farm here they
changed the the behavior of the rabbits

90
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:47,960
changed the the behavior of the rabbits
 

91
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
changed the the behavior of the rabbits
and I haven't tried this thing out yet

92
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,490
and I haven't tried this thing out yet
 

93
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,370
and I haven't tried this thing out yet
that hasn't been used at all really

94
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,380
that hasn't been used at all really
 

95
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,710
that hasn't been used at all really
because before they were more like pets

96
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:53,720
because before they were more like pets
 

97
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
because before they were more like pets
and they would teleport around now they

98
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,250
and they would teleport around now they
 

99
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,390
and they would teleport around now they
don't do that so I can actually farm

100
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
don't do that so I can actually farm
 

101
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,110
don't do that so I can actually farm
them a little easier so this is the

102
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
them a little easier so this is the
 

103
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,360
them a little easier so this is the
tunnel this is a design I start or I

104
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,370
tunnel this is a design I start or I
 

105
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,699
tunnel this is a design I start or I
decided to go with it's just about done

106
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,709
decided to go with it's just about done
 

107
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,910
decided to go with it's just about done
there's still this downward slope area I

108
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
there's still this downward slope area I
 

109
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,190
there's still this downward slope area I
got to work out the details too but this

110
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,200
got to work out the details too but this
 

111
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,170
got to work out the details too but this
is the design I decide to try out I

112
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,180
is the design I decide to try out I
 

113
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,820
is the design I decide to try out I
think it's kind of cool I'm hoping this

114
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:18,830
think it's kind of cool I'm hoping this
 

115
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,060
think it's kind of cool I'm hoping this
carpet doesn't catch fire so far it

116
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,070
carpet doesn't catch fire so far it
 

117
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,040
carpet doesn't catch fire so far it
hasn't which has surprised me I think it

118
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,050
hasn't which has surprised me I think it
 

119
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,130
hasn't which has surprised me I think it
might be out of range

120
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,140
might be out of range
 

121
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,780
might be out of range
lava and fire behave differently in

122
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:28,790
lava and fire behave differently in
 

123
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,990
lava and fire behave differently in
terms of how they catch stuff on fire

124
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
terms of how they catch stuff on fire
 

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,699
terms of how they catch stuff on fire
I'm pretty sure otherwise this would

126
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:33,709
I'm pretty sure otherwise this would
 

127
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,770
I'm pretty sure otherwise this would
have went up in flames already if it

128
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:35,780
have went up in flames already if it
 

129
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,120
have went up in flames already if it
worked the same as fire but yeah we got

130
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,130
worked the same as fire but yeah we got
 

131
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,699
worked the same as fire but yeah we got
cyan carpet running down and then it's

132
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:42,709
cyan carpet running down and then it's
 

133
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,640

and get some signs go and then we can

140
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,340
and get some signs go and then we can
 

141
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,600
and get some signs go and then we can
probably test it out I have not figured

142
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:55,610
probably test it out I have not figured
 

143
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,000
probably test it out I have not figured
out how to do the corners yet or the

144
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,010
out how to do the corners yet or the
 

145
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,830
out how to do the corners yet or the
launching stuff so that's that's

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,430
rotation system it's an old design I
came up with boats you make like boat

162
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
came up with boats you make like boat
 

163
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,200
came up with boats you make like boat
roads but unfortunately game mechanics

164
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,210
roads but unfortunately game mechanics
 

165
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,150
roads but unfortunately game mechanics
kind of changed on the way and now

166
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
kind of changed on the way and now
 

167
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,670
kind of changed on the way and now
they're even more fragile than ever

168
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,680
they're even more fragile than ever
 

169
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,070
they're even more fragile than ever
before you look at a boat and it breaks

170
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080
before you look at a boat and it breaks
 

171
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,100
before you look at a boat and it breaks
now it's insane so I don't know how this

172
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,110
now it's insane so I don't know how this
 

173
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,390
now it's insane so I don't know how this
is going to go down we're going to try

174
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
is going to go down we're going to try
 

175
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,050
is going to go down we're going to try
it out so one of my old favorite things

176
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,060
it out so one of my old favorite things
 

177
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,410
it out so one of my old favorite things
was what I called an ez loader which is

178
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:44,420
was what I called an ez loader which is
 

179
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,030
was what I called an ez loader which is
basically this setup here this was a way

180
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
basically this setup here this was a way
 

181
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,100
basically this setup here this was a way
of loading boats into a system and

182
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,110
of loading boats into a system and
 

183
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,280
of loading boats into a system and
aligning them properly against the wall

184
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,290
aligning them properly against the wall
 

185
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,380
aligning them properly against the wall
let's see if it still works basically

186
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,390
let's see if it still works basically
 

187
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,440
let's see if it still works basically
you get a boat and you place it right in

188
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,450
you get a boat and you place it right in
 

189
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,470
you get a boat and you place it right in
the middle here and it should go

190
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,480
the middle here and it should go
 

191
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,060
the middle here and it should go
underneath it might've you know what I

192
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,070
underneath it might've you know what I
 

193
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,440
underneath it might've you know what I
never did I never put the water here

194
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,450
never did I never put the water here
 

195
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,690
never did I never put the water here
let's try it again can I get this back

196
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:10,700
let's try it again can I get this back
 

197
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,030
let's try it again can I get this back
please oh that is nice

198
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,040
please oh that is nice
 

199
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,300
please oh that is nice
oops when I used to play around with

200
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,310
oops when I used to play around with
 

201
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,909
oops when I used to play around with
researching this stuff I just I had to

202
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:18,919
researching this stuff I just I had to
 

203
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,310
researching this stuff I just I had to
chop down so many trees because every

204
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,320
chop down so many trees because every
 

205
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,290
chop down so many trees because every
boat you would lose a little bit of wood

206
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,300
boat you would lose a little bit of wood
 

207
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,600
boat you would lose a little bit of wood
when you would test it out now you can

208
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,610
when you would test it out now you can
 

209
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,190
when you would test it out now you can
actually get the boat back though and

210
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,200

 

211
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:40,510

214
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:44,600
minecraft oh man I don't think it's
 

215
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,240
minecraft oh man I don't think it's
working I think it's stuck oh man oh I

216
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,250
working I think it's stuck oh man oh I
 

217
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,150
working I think it's stuck oh man oh I
wonder you know what maybe I didn't have

218
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
wonder you know what maybe I didn't have
 

219
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,820
wonder you know what maybe I didn't have
a block over top so it possibly floated

220
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:57,830
a block over top so it possibly floated
 

221
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,040
a block over top so it possibly floated
up and can't get underneath I think it's

222
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,050
up and can't get underneath I think it's
 

223
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,969
up and can't get underneath I think it's
like stuck here somewhere oh yeah it is

224
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:02,979
like stuck here somewhere oh yeah it is
 

225
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,890
like stuck here somewhere oh yeah it is
all it's kind of under underneath here

226
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:05,900
all it's kind of under underneath here
 

227
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,409
all it's kind of under underneath here
what's going on oh it's stuck in the

228
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,419
what's going on oh it's stuck in the
 

229
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:13,480
what's going on oh it's stuck in the
glass panes I think no yes

230
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,490
glass panes I think no yes
 

231
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,159
glass panes I think no yes
Oh No okay where are we all right we got

232
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:18,169
Oh No okay where are we all right we got
 

233
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,750
Oh No okay where are we all right we got
out let's try it one more time with the

234
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:19,760
out let's try it one more time with the
 

235
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,930
out let's try it one more time with the
blocks should hold the boat down and it

236
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:22,940
blocks should hold the boat down and it
 

237
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,810
blocks should hold the boat down and it
just explodes great so that is not off

238
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:25,820
just explodes great so that is not off
 

239
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,709
just explodes great so that is not off
to a good start not at all

240
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:29,719
to a good start not at all
 

241
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,829
to a good start not at all
let's try one more time we'll hop in at

242
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:32,839
let's try one more time we'll hop in at
 

243
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,559
let's try one more time we'll hop in at
this time actually let me if we're going

244
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:35,569
this time actually let me if we're going
 

245
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,850
this time actually let me if we're going
to do that let's change this out to

246
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:36,860
to do that let's change this out to
 

247
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,689
to do that let's change this out to
glass okay here we go yeah it hit the

248
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:43,699
glass okay here we go yeah it hit the
 

249
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,469
glass okay here we go yeah it hit the
glass panes hmm

250
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
glass panes hmm
 

251
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,289
glass panes hmm
are they fatter now because this used to

252
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:50,299
are they fatter now because this used to
 

253
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,499
are they fatter now because this used to
work like not long ago now it doesn't

254
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:53,509
work like not long ago now it doesn't
 

255
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,299
work like not long ago now it doesn't
seem to fit between a block in it and

256
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:55,309
seem to fit between a block in it and
 

257
00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:01,209
seem to fit between a block in it and
like a half here huh that could be a

258
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:01,219
like a half here huh that could be a
 

259
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,399
like a half here huh that could be a
problem

260
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,409
problem
 

261
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,839
problem
uh-huh okay I got to figure it out here

262
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:04,849
uh-huh okay I got to figure it out here
 

263
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,719
uh-huh okay I got to figure it out here
guys so what what it's doing I think the

264
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:07,729
guys so what what it's doing I think the
 

265
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,999
guys so what what it's doing I think the
boat is still rotating when it hits the

266
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,009
boat is still rotating when it hits the
 

267
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,189
boat is still rotating when it hits the
wall here so it's not perfectly aligned

268
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:12,199
wall here so it's not perfectly aligned
 

269
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,739
wall here so it's not perfectly aligned
against it so it's like over a little

270
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:14,749
against it so it's like over a little
 

271
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:17,109
against it so it's like over a little
bit and then it hits get the glass panes

272
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:17,119
bit and then it hits get the glass panes
 

273
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,399
bit and then it hits get the glass panes
because it's not in the right spot if we

274
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:20,409
because it's not in the right spot if we
 

275
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,469
because it's not in the right spot if we
yeah if you notice there's like a little

276
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
yeah if you notice there's like a little
 

277
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,269
yeah if you notice there's like a little
gap between the wall and the boat still

278
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:25,279
gap between the wall and the boat still
 

279
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,699
gap between the wall and the boat still
we got to get all the way over to the

280
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:27,709
we got to get all the way over to the
 

281
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,219
we got to get all the way over to the
left I think it's not letting me move it

282
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:33,229
left I think it's not letting me move it
 

283
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,799
left I think it's not letting me move it
when I try though oh man oh man I'm in a

284
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:38,809
when I try though oh man oh man I'm in a
 

285
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:42,429
when I try though oh man oh man I'm in a
boat I actually I don't know because it

286
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:42,439
boat I actually I don't know because it
 

287
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,319
boat I actually I don't know because it
looks like it it's within the glass

288
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,329
looks like it it's within the glass
 

289
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,449
looks like it it's within the glass
panes right there's a little bit of gap

290
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:46,459
panes right there's a little bit of gap
 

291
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,919
panes right there's a little bit of gap
there but there's also a little bit of a

292
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:47,929
there but there's also a little bit of a
 

293
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:51,519
there but there's also a little bit of a
gap between the boat and the wall let's

294
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:51,529
gap between the boat and the wall let's
 

295
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,719
gap between the boat and the wall let's
see if we can push it any closer

296
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:54,729
see if we can push it any closer
 

297
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,850
see if we can push it any closer
it might just no I doesn't go at all it

298
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:57,860
it might just no I doesn't go at all it
 

299
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,759
it might just no I doesn't go at all it
doesn't budge so that is it's like it's

300
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:03,769
doesn't budge so that is it's like it's
 

301
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,979
doesn't budge so that is it's like it's
fatter now yeah it is actually fatter

302
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:05,989
fatter now yeah it is actually fatter
 

303
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,549
fatter now yeah it is actually fatter
now that's that's weird

304
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:08,559
now that's that's weird
 

305
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,499
now that's that's weird
all right that's no good that's no good

306
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:11,509
all right that's no good that's no good
 

307
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,509
all right that's no good that's no good
at all that means the glass panes in the

308
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:13,519
at all that means the glass panes in the
 

309
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,429
at all that means the glass panes in the
middle are not going to work boat to fat

310
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:15,439
middle are not going to work boat to fat
 

311
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,979
middle are not going to work boat to fat
we're going to try the old ladder way

312
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:17,989
we're going to try the old ladder way
 

313
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:21,519
we're going to try the old ladder way
instead then we will have to do the

314
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:21,529
instead then we will have to do the
 

315
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,029
instead then we will have to do the
water like this or else put pressure

316
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
water like this or else put pressure
 

317
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,009
water like this or else put pressure
plates in the middle to keep it from

318
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:27,019
plates in the middle to keep it from
 

319
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:29,799
plates in the middle to keep it from
flowing all over the place here let's

320
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:29,809
flowing all over the place here let's
 

321
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:34,569
flowing all over the place here let's
put a block here to water here all right

322
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:34,579
put a block here to water here all right
 

323
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,480
put a block here to water here all right
and if this is the way we have to do it

324
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,490
and if this is the way we have to do it
 

325
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,969
and if this is the way we have to do it
then I have to redesign the tunnel you

326
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979
then I have to redesign the tunnel you
 

327
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,459
then I have to redesign the tunnel you
know maybe just maybe we should have

328
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:42,469
know maybe just maybe we should have
 

329
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,450
know maybe just maybe we should have
tried to figure out

330
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,460
tried to figure out
 

331
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,580
tried to figure out
to how to do it before I designed it

332
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,590
to how to do it before I designed it
 

333
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,900
to how to do it before I designed it
that might have been the way of going

334
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:46,910
that might have been the way of going
 

335
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,140
that might have been the way of going
about it but no I build it then I find

336
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,150
about it but no I build it then I find
 

337
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,060
about it but no I build it then I find
out it doesn't work and then I change it

338
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,070
out it doesn't work and then I change it
 

339
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,050
out it doesn't work and then I change it
that's that's the easy way this still

340
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,060
that's that's the easy way this still
 

341
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,970
that's that's the easy way this still
works

342
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:56,980
works
 

343
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,430
works
Wow all right that works that is great

344
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,440
Wow all right that works that is great
 

345
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,380
Wow all right that works that is great
um does not look quite as good let's see

346
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,390
um does not look quite as good let's see
 

347
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,340
um does not look quite as good let's see
what could we do here

348
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,350
what could we do here
 

349
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,520
what could we do here
oh I'm drowning if we just move these

350
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,530
oh I'm drowning if we just move these
 

351
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,590
oh I'm drowning if we just move these
out one block how bad is that going to

352
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
out one block how bad is that going to
 

353
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,890
out one block how bad is that going to
look and put a ladder on it

354
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:14,900
look and put a ladder on it
 

355
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,920
look and put a ladder on it
there is no netherrack ladders or nether

356
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:17,930
there is no netherrack ladders or nether
 

357
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,380
there is no netherrack ladders or nether
brick ladders or anything like that

358
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,390
brick ladders or anything like that
 

359
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,780
brick ladders or anything like that
unfortunately so this might be hard to

360
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,790
unfortunately so this might be hard to
 

361
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,140
unfortunately so this might be hard to
to fix and make look good can't place

362
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,150
to fix and make look good can't place
 

363
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,770
to fix and make look good can't place
ladder on that ah why can't you put

364
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:32,780
ladder on that ah why can't you put
 

365
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,600
ladder on that ah why can't you put
pressure plates on glass and stuff I

366
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,610
pressure plates on glass and stuff I
 

367
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,490
pressure plates on glass and stuff I
never understood that like is there

368
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,500
never understood that like is there
 

369
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:47,860
never understood that like is there
actually a reason for it I wonder um mm

370
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:47,870
actually a reason for it I wonder um mm
 

371
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,410
actually a reason for it I wonder um mm
okay let me get my blocks how else could

372
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:50,420
okay let me get my blocks how else could
 

373
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,410
okay let me get my blocks how else could
we do this because if we just put like

374
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,420
we do this because if we just put like
 

375
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,180
we do this because if we just put like
this on it and then bladder ah so much

376
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,190
this on it and then bladder ah so much
 

377
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,370
this on it and then bladder ah so much
worse isn't it the ladder is I was

378
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:00,380
worse isn't it the ladder is I was
 

379
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,960
worse isn't it the ladder is I was
really hoping we could avoid using the

380
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:01,970
really hoping we could avoid using the
 

381
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,820
really hoping we could avoid using the
ladders too because then now we're

382
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:03,830
ladders too because then now we're
 

383
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,530
ladders too because then now we're
mixing wood with nether brick and that's

384
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:05,540
mixing wood with nether brick and that's
 

385
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,010
mixing wood with nether brick and that's
just

386
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,020
just
 

387
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,080
just
ah too bad okay option two no ladders

388
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,090
ah too bad okay option two no ladders
 

389
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,420
ah too bad okay option two no ladders
let's just try to use the fences they

390
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,430
let's just try to use the fences they
 

391
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,140
let's just try to use the fences they
stick out a lot more which I don't like

392
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,150
stick out a lot more which I don't like
 

393
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,550
stick out a lot more which I don't like
as much but they do blend in like I want

394
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,560
as much but they do blend in like I want
 

395
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,140
as much but they do blend in like I want
to see if it's like really in our face

396
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,150
to see if it's like really in our face
 

397
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,400
to see if it's like really in our face
now and if it's not too bad

398
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,410
now and if it's not too bad
 

399
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,700
now and if it's not too bad
oh and it doesn't even work what Oh

400
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:30,710
oh and it doesn't even work what Oh
 

401
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,090
oh and it doesn't even work what Oh
because yes this gap from from this half

402
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,100
because yes this gap from from this half
 

403
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,140
because yes this gap from from this half
to this is over the boat width actually

404
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,150
to this is over the boat width actually
 

405
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,660
to this is over the boat width actually
you know what we can use the fat boats

406
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:40,670
you know what we can use the fat boats
 

407
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,210
you know what we can use the fat boats
to our advantage here because before if

408
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,220
to our advantage here because before if
 

409
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,410
to our advantage here because before if
you want to put blocks in the middle

410
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:44,420
you want to put blocks in the middle
 

411
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,930
you want to put blocks in the middle
you'd have to use full blocks and it was

412
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:46,940
you'd have to use full blocks and it was
 

413
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,860
you'd have to use full blocks and it was
kind of yeah not quite so nice we could

414
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:50,870
kind of yeah not quite so nice we could
 

415
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,200
kind of yeah not quite so nice we could
get away with using panes or even like

416
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,210
get away with using panes or even like
 

417
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,120
get away with using panes or even like
nether brick fences running down the

418
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,130
nether brick fences running down the
 

419
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,190
nether brick fences running down the
middle one block up and the boat

420
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
middle one block up and the boat
 

421
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,170
middle one block up and the boat
should stay down right let's try it out

422
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,180
should stay down right let's try it out
 

423
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,030
should stay down right let's try it out
then we could still keep the design on

424
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,040
then we could still keep the design on
 

425
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,830
then we could still keep the design on
the walls we wouldn't have to change

426
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:05,840
the walls we wouldn't have to change
 

427
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,950
the walls we wouldn't have to change
anything I think we might be on to

428
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:08,960
anything I think we might be on to
 

429
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,730
anything I think we might be on to
something

430
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:11,740

 

431
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,230

all right yes this actually works well I

432
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,240
all right yes this actually works well I
 

433
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,840
all right yes this actually works well I
might just do glass panes actually I

434
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:19,850
might just do glass panes actually I
 

435
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,160
might just do glass panes actually I
think they might look a little better a

436
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,170
think they might look a little better a
 

437
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,320
think they might look a little better a
little less intrusive

438
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,330

 

439
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,580

okay so playing around with some more

440
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:27,590
okay so playing around with some more
 

441
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,620
okay so playing around with some more
stuff here glass panes in the middle I

442
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,630
stuff here glass panes in the middle I
 

443
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,090
stuff here glass panes in the middle I
don't think that looks too bad right

444
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,100
don't think that looks too bad right
 

445
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,050
don't think that looks too bad right
kind of like that we might just do a

446
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,060
kind of like that we might just do a
 

447
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,510
kind of like that we might just do a
really simple launcher here so I got the

448
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:37,520
really simple launcher here so I got the
 

449
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,750
really simple launcher here so I got the
easy loader I put a dispenser here and

450
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
easy loader I put a dispenser here and
 

451
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
easy loader I put a dispenser here and
this actually works it'll dispense the

452
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,170
this actually works it'll dispense the
 

453
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,420
this actually works it'll dispense the
boats and they seem to get stuck

454
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,430
boats and they seem to get stuck
 

455
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,590
boats and they seem to get stuck
underneath the glass which is cool and

456
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
underneath the glass which is cool and
 

457
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,150
underneath the glass which is cool and
basically they come by you'd have to

458
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,160
basically they come by you'd have to
 

459
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,980
basically they come by you'd have to
catch the boat while it goes by though

460
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:50,990
catch the boat while it goes by though
 

461
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,130
catch the boat while it goes by though
it doesn't hold it which is me being

462
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,140
it doesn't hold it which is me being
 

463
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,770
it doesn't hold it which is me being
just a little bit lazy the only problem

464
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:56,780
just a little bit lazy the only problem
 

465
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,920
just a little bit lazy the only problem
is when I get in it does that and I

466
00:11:59,920 --> 00:11:59,930
is when I get in it does that and I
 

467
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,820
is when I get in it does that and I
don't know exactly what happens there

468
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:02,830
don't know exactly what happens there
 

469
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,040
don't know exactly what happens there
because the game D sinks a little bit

470
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,050
because the game D sinks a little bit
 

471
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,060
because the game D sinks a little bit
and it's hard to tell if I actually make

472
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,070
and it's hard to tell if I actually make
 

473
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,280
and it's hard to tell if I actually make
the jump here if I if I like fall down

474
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,290
the jump here if I if I like fall down
 

475
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,100
the jump here if I if I like fall down
or what or if I actually break the boat

476
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,110
or what or if I actually break the boat
 

477
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,700
or what or if I actually break the boat
up here like the pieces of the boat are

478
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:18,710
up here like the pieces of the boat are
 

479
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,610
up here like the pieces of the boat are
down there you see this is the pieces

480
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:20,620
down there you see this is the pieces
 

481
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,190
down there you see this is the pieces
but my player ends up up there so I

482
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,200
but my player ends up up there so I
 

483
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,280
but my player ends up up there so I
don't know actually you know what we

484
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,290
don't know actually you know what we
 

485
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,430
don't know actually you know what we
might try just yeah let's do this let's

486
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
might try just yeah let's do this let's
 

487
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,530
might try just yeah let's do this let's
let's put some water down here and see

488
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,540
let's put some water down here and see
 

489
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,840
let's put some water down here and see
what it does with that oh that melted

490
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,850
what it does with that oh that melted
 

491
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,000
what it does with that oh that melted
quick yeah that that should stop it from

492
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,010
quick yeah that that should stop it from
 

493
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,650
quick yeah that that should stop it from
breaking so if the boat is actually

494
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:44,660
breaking so if the boat is actually
 

495
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,760
breaking so if the boat is actually
going down it should be different this

496
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:48,770
going down it should be different this
 

497
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,250
going down it should be different this
time right a lot of trial and error

498
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,260
time right a lot of trial and error
 

499
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,210
time right a lot of trial and error
trying to figure this out

500
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,220
trying to figure this out
 

501
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,890
trying to figure this out
oh okay so it is actually going down all

502
00:12:59,890 --> 00:12:59,900
oh okay so it is actually going down all
 

503
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,400
oh okay so it is actually going down all
right

504
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,410
right
 

505
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,060
right
that's good to know so I got to make it

506
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,070
that's good to know so I got to make it
 

507
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,640
that's good to know so I got to make it
do a jump here and then catch a water

508
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,650
do a jump here and then catch a water
 

509
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,760
do a jump here and then catch a water
stream and get underneath the pains in

510
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:09,770
stream and get underneath the pains in
 

511
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,619
stream and get underneath the pains in
the middle again

512
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:11,629
the middle again
 

513
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,449
the middle again
for coming back up to the hill we're

514
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:13,459
for coming back up to the hill we're
 

515
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,980
for coming back up to the hill we're
going to do slime launchers which is

516
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:14,990
going to do slime launchers which is
 

517
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,319
going to do slime launchers which is
something I tried a long time ago and it

518
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:17,329
something I tried a long time ago and it
 

519
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,100
something I tried a long time ago and it
actually worked

520
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,110
actually worked
 

521
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,999
actually worked
so I think we can pull that off

522
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:21,009
so I think we can pull that off
 

523
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,929
so I think we can pull that off
basically we're trying to do a little

524
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:22,939
basically we're trying to do a little
 

525
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,489
basically we're trying to do a little
bit of everything here we want to do a

526
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:24,499
bit of everything here we want to do a
 

527
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,429
bit of everything here we want to do a
launcher I'm trying to do it an uphill

528
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:27,439
launcher I'm trying to do it an uphill
 

529
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,049
launcher I'm trying to do it an uphill
downhill section and then a corner and

530
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:31,059
downhill section and then a corner and
 

531
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,519
downhill section and then a corner and
hopefully we can pull all these off that

532
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:33,529
hopefully we can pull all these off that
 

533
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,069
hopefully we can pull all these off that
would be pretty cool

534
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:35,079
would be pretty cool
 

535
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:37,869
would be pretty cool
all right cool so I got a little bit

536
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:37,879
all right cool so I got a little bit
 

537
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,910
all right cool so I got a little bit
more done here I got the downhill worked

538
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
more done here I got the downhill worked
 

539
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,780
more done here I got the downhill worked
out I haven't done the uphill and I

540
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:42,790
out I haven't done the uphill and I
 

541
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,949
out I haven't done the uphill and I
experimented a little bit with the

542
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
experimented a little bit with the
 

543
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,639
experimented a little bit with the
corner the corner is tough to do boats

544
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:48,649
corner the corner is tough to do boats
 

545
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,259
corner the corner is tough to do boats
break so easily

546
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:50,269
break so easily
 

547
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:57,040
break so easily
it's insane even with cobwebs um so yeah

548
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,050
it's insane even with cobwebs um so yeah
 

549
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,189
it's insane even with cobwebs um so yeah
let's just do one one more drive one

550
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,199
let's just do one one more drive one
 

551
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,769
let's just do one one more drive one
more ride here and then we'll go do

552
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:02,779
more ride here and then we'll go do
 

553
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,769
more ride here and then we'll go do
something else I think for today so kind

554
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:05,779
something else I think for today so kind
 

555
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,999
something else I think for today so kind
of dee sinks there and then it catches

556
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:07,009
of dee sinks there and then it catches
 

557
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:09,879
of dee sinks there and then it catches
up it's weird but it gets underneath the

558
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:09,889
up it's weird but it gets underneath the
 

559
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,850
up it's weird but it gets underneath the
glass panes no problem so that's good

560
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:12,860
glass panes no problem so that's good
 

561
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,569
glass panes no problem so that's good
it's working pretty pretty well yeah

562
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:16,579
it's working pretty pretty well yeah
 

563
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,280
it's working pretty pretty well yeah
let's go and let's go try out that

564
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,290
let's go and let's go try out that
 

565
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,079
let's go and let's go try out that
rabbit thing I want to see if that farm

566
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,089
rabbit thing I want to see if that farm
 

567
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,480
rabbit thing I want to see if that farm
still works with the changes to the

568
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,490
still works with the changes to the
 

569
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,139
still works with the changes to the
rabbit behavior so just let me drop off

570
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:26,149
rabbit behavior so just let me drop off
 

571
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:32,559
rabbit behavior so just let me drop off
some of our stuff okay let's go so yeah

572
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:32,569
some of our stuff okay let's go so yeah
 

573
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,960
some of our stuff okay let's go so yeah
rabbits like they don't teleport to you

574
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:34,970
rabbits like they don't teleport to you
 

575
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,150
rabbits like they don't teleport to you
anymore so this farm might work a lot

576
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,160
anymore so this farm might work a lot
 

577
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,360
anymore so this farm might work a lot
better now close your eyes children oh

578
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,370
better now close your eyes children oh
 

579
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,650
better now close your eyes children oh
I'm sorry I didn't warn you far enough

580
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:44,660
I'm sorry I didn't warn you far enough
 

581
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,949
I'm sorry I didn't warn you far enough
in advance there so before I used to

582
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:47,959
in advance there so before I used to
 

583
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,499
in advance there so before I used to
have to tie them down with the leads so

584
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:50,509
have to tie them down with the leads so
 

585
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,360
have to tie them down with the leads so
they went teleport away I don't think

586
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,370
they went teleport away I don't think
 

587
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,220
they went teleport away I don't think
that's required anymore so got some

588
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,230
that's required anymore so got some
 

589
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,259
that's required anymore so got some
carrots here they were trampling all my

590
00:14:59,259 --> 00:14:59,269
carrots here they were trampling all my
 

591
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,259
carrots here they were trampling all my
crops and stuff too so shouldn't be a

592
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:02,269
crops and stuff too so shouldn't be a
 

593
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,190
crops and stuff too so shouldn't be a
problem with them staying put now

594
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,200

 

595
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:16,950

whoa oh man they got up somehow

596
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:16,960

 

597
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,930

they're like a bunch of balloons all

598
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:18,940
they're like a bunch of balloons all
 

599
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,660
they're like a bunch of balloons all
tied to strings trying to float away

600
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:21,670
tied to strings trying to float away
 

601
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,330
tied to strings trying to float away
they are dying like crazy what is going

602
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,340
they are dying like crazy what is going
 

603
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,730
they are dying like crazy what is going
on we got one guy here oh yeah they all

604
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:29,740
on we got one guy here oh yeah they all
 

605
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,240
on we got one guy here oh yeah they all
jumped out somehow oh and I'm trapped

606
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,250
jumped out somehow oh and I'm trapped
 

607
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,500
jumped out somehow oh and I'm trapped
all right so I'll have to build this up

608
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,510
all right so I'll have to build this up
 

609
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,090
all right so I'll have to build this up
higher it looks like before they weren't

610
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,100
higher it looks like before they weren't
 

611
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,330
higher it looks like before they weren't
able to get out and let's try feed them

612
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,340
able to get out and let's try feed them
 

613
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,860
able to get out and let's try feed them
they don't jump anymore either it looks

614
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:49,870
they don't jump anymore either it looks
 

615
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,070
they don't jump anymore either it looks
like so I might have to put some water

616
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,080
like so I might have to put some water
 

617
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,990
like so I might have to put some water
down there so that I can feed them okay

618
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
down there so that I can feed them okay
 

619
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,880
down there so that I can feed them okay
so I built it up a little bit higher

620
00:15:59,880 --> 00:15:59,890
so I built it up a little bit higher
 

621
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,620
so I built it up a little bit higher
they shouldn't be able to get out now I

622
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:01,630
they shouldn't be able to get out now I
 

623
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,890
they shouldn't be able to get out now I
think what we'll do here as well oh did

624
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:04,900
think what we'll do here as well oh did
 

625
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,300
think what we'll do here as well oh did
I lose that oh no oh I died got it here

626
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,310
I lose that oh no oh I died got it here
 

627
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,030
I lose that oh no oh I died got it here
okay so that's right yeah so touch of

628
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,040
okay so that's right yeah so touch of
 

629
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,150
okay so that's right yeah so touch of
course so these guys they don't need to

630
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,160
course so these guys they don't need to
 

631
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,610
course so these guys they don't need to
be on leads anymore so I'm gonna try

632
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:17,620
be on leads anymore so I'm gonna try
 

633
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,770
be on leads anymore so I'm gonna try
free them right clicking does not seem

634
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:19,780
free them right clicking does not seem
 

635
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,480
free them right clicking does not seem
to be working though oh there we go i

636
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,490
to be working though oh there we go i
 

637
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,120
to be working though oh there we go i
freed them all in one click there okay

638
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,130
freed them all in one click there okay
 

639
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:33,900
freed them all in one click there okay
so they're free that's good and see I

640
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:33,910
so they're free that's good and see I
 

641
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,970
so they're free that's good and see I
got some the care Tommy let's see if we

642
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:35,980
got some the care Tommy let's see if we
 

643
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,940
got some the care Tommy let's see if we
can breed them without them jumping I

644
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,950
can breed them without them jumping I
 

645
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,570
can breed them without them jumping I
think they have to be jumping otherwise

646
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:41,580
think they have to be jumping otherwise
 

647
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,220
think they have to be jumping otherwise
we're gonna have trouble here can I even

648
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,230
we're gonna have trouble here can I even
 

649
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:51,090
we're gonna have trouble here can I even
reach them I don't know if I can no okay

650
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,100
reach them I don't know if I can no okay
 

651
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,160
reach them I don't know if I can no okay
so this might be a this might have to be

652
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,170
so this might be a this might have to be
 

653
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,170
so this might be a this might have to be
a half slab

654
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,180

 

655
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,540

because if it's only what it is right

656
00:16:59,540 --> 00:16:59,550
because if it's only what it is right
 

657
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,340
because if it's only what it is right
now they can get out and if it's if it's

658
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,350
now they can get out and if it's if it's
 

659
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,090
now they can get out and if it's if it's
a log up then I can't reach it so let's

660
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,100
a log up then I can't reach it so let's
 

661
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,470
a log up then I can't reach it so let's
try it in between solution here

662
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,480
try it in between solution here
 

663
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,189
try it in between solution here
hopefully this will still hold them oh

664
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
hopefully this will still hold them oh
 

665
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,220
hopefully this will still hold them oh
he's trying to get out all right now I

666
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,230
he's trying to get out all right now I
 

667
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,510
he's trying to get out all right now I
can reach them hopefully yeah it seems

668
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
can reach them hopefully yeah it seems
 

669
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,949
can reach them hopefully yeah it seems
to be working we got some baby bunnies

670
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
to be working we got some baby bunnies
 

671
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
to be working we got some baby bunnies
down here I'm wondering if I'm gonna try

672
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,170
down here I'm wondering if I'm gonna try
 

673
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,200
down here I'm wondering if I'm gonna try
one more thing here I'm gonna try change

674
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,210
one more thing here I'm gonna try change
 

675
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,940
one more thing here I'm gonna try change
this out with a half slab they're not

676
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:34,950
this out with a half slab they're not
 

677
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,990
this out with a half slab they're not
free good oh I can't place it though oh

678
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
free good oh I can't place it though oh
 

679
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,990
free good oh I can't place it though oh
there we go we got it can I get rid of

680
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
there we go we got it can I get rid of
 

681
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,640
there we go we got it can I get rid of
this one I'm thinking it might be easier

682
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:46,650
this one I'm thinking it might be easier
 

683
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,110
this one I'm thinking it might be easier
to feed them this way I can feed them

684
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,120
to feed them this way I can feed them
 

685
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
to feed them this way I can feed them
from from the front instead of having to

686
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,130
from from the front instead of having to
 

687
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,500
from from the front instead of having to
climb up but I think the babies will

688
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,510
climb up but I think the babies will
 

689
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,700
climb up but I think the babies will
just fall out through there hmm

690
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:00,710

 

691
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,080

yeah if it's like that I can't reach

692
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,090
yeah if it's like that I can't reach
 

693
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,050

all
all right so here's the Nexus update

716
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:37,650
all right so here's the Nexus update
 

717
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,420
all right so here's the Nexus update
guys basically I think the wall used to

718
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,430
guys basically I think the wall used to
 

719
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,280
guys basically I think the wall used to
be about over here like this was a solid

720

wall all the way down so I cleared out
 

723
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,230
wall all the way down so I cleared out
all this land then I built these front

724
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,240
all this land then I built these front
 

725
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,300
all this land then I built these front
faces no facades is that the right word

726
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,310
faces no facades is that the right word
 

727
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,320
faces no facades is that the right word
face plates that's what I like the

728
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,330
face plates that's what I like the
 

729
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,810
face plates that's what I like the
column yeah built the face plates if we

730
00:18:59,810 --> 00:18:59,820
column yeah built the face plates if we
 

731
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,180
column yeah built the face plates if we
go down I also started working on a

732
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,190
go down I also started working on a
 

733
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,940
go down I also started working on a
bunch of the redstone this part is like

734
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:04,950
bunch of the redstone this part is like
 

735
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,510
bunch of the redstone this part is like
nuts because I can't see

736
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
nuts because I can't see
 

737
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,970
nuts because I can't see
so dumb I can't see what I did before

738
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:11,980
so dumb I can't see what I did before
 

739
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,740
so dumb I can't see what I did before
cuz it's all so compact and covered up

740
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:15,750
cuz it's all so compact and covered up
 

741
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,389
cuz it's all so compact and covered up
yeah I got all this redstone done as

742
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:18,399
yeah I got all this redstone done as
 

743
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,649
yeah I got all this redstone done as
well um we're just about to start the

744
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:22,659
well um we're just about to start the
 

745
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,760
well um we're just about to start the
second layer on this stuff actually yeah

746
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:26,770
second layer on this stuff actually yeah
 

747
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,500
second layer on this stuff actually yeah
so this is what I'm working off of I

748
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,510
so this is what I'm working off of I
 

749
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,470
so this is what I'm working off of I
have to try copy this and I can't see

750
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,480
have to try copy this and I can't see
 

751
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,779
have to try copy this and I can't see
what I did so stupid so I I stare at it

752
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:36,789
what I did so stupid so I I stare at it
 

753
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,310
what I did so stupid so I I stare at it
try to memorize it then I walk over

754
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
try to memorize it then I walk over
 

755
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,289
try to memorize it then I walk over
build a little bit forget I have to come

756
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:43,299
build a little bit forget I have to come
 

757
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,690
build a little bit forget I have to come
back and look at it again and try to

758
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:45,700
back and look at it again and try to
 

759
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,389
back and look at it again and try to
make out what it is and yeah this is a

760
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:48,399
make out what it is and yeah this is a
 

761
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,080
make out what it is and yeah this is a
nightmare

762
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,090
nightmare
 

763
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,149
nightmare
but little by little it's coming

764
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:51,159
but little by little it's coming
 

765
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,120
but little by little it's coming
together the second layer to this is

766
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,130
together the second layer to this is
 

767
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,350
together the second layer to this is
going to start umm where maybe we should

768
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,360
going to start umm where maybe we should
 

769
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,639
going to start umm where maybe we should
try figure that out so we need I think

770
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:02,649
try figure that out so we need I think
 

771
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,990
try figure that out so we need I think
this is the lowest point on it so how

772
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,000
this is the lowest point on it so how
 

773
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,190
this is the lowest point on it so how
tall is this all one two three four five

774
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
tall is this all one two three four five
 

775
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,090
tall is this all one two three four five
six seven eight blocks tall no it's got

776
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,100
six seven eight blocks tall no it's got
 

777
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,350
six seven eight blocks tall no it's got
to be more than that alright it's eight

778
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,360
to be more than that alright it's eight
 

779
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,889
to be more than that alright it's eight
over here oh that is the top wait a

780
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:25,899
over here oh that is the top wait a
 

781
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,649
over here oh that is the top wait a
minute no because we need a water stream

782
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:28,659
minute no because we need a water stream
 

783
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,680
minute no because we need a water stream
here yet

784
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:30,690
here yet
 

785
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,919
here yet
so water nine if we have like redstone

786
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:37,929
so water nine if we have like redstone
 

787
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:39,330
so water nine if we have like redstone
above these hoppers that might cause

788
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:39,340
above these hoppers that might cause
 

789
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,350
above these hoppers that might cause
trouble - is there any redstone there no

790
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,360
trouble - is there any redstone there no
 

791
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,880
trouble - is there any redstone there no
so it's about nine bucks tall that means

792
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:47,890
so it's about nine bucks tall that means
 

793
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,820
so it's about nine bucks tall that means
the second layer is gonna start hey

794
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:50,830
the second layer is gonna start hey
 

795
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:57,480
the second layer is gonna start hey
let's get some stone bricks yeah we need

796
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,490
let's get some stone bricks yeah we need
 

797
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,820
let's get some stone bricks yeah we need
one block for the water so water has to

798
00:20:59,820 --> 00:20:59,830
one block for the water so water has to
 

799
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,310
one block for the water so water has to
run over top these hoppers I think we

800
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
run over top these hoppers I think we
 

801
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,529
run over top these hoppers I think we
can start the next layer there then that

802
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:04,539
can start the next layer there then that
 

803
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,139
can start the next layer there then that
means yeah okay it looks like we need

804
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:10,149
means yeah okay it looks like we need
 

805
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,779
means yeah okay it looks like we need
one block for the redstone to go on then

806
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:12,789
one block for the redstone to go on then
 

807
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,870
one block for the redstone to go on then
the redstone level then this is level 3

808
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:15,880
the redstone level then this is level 3
 

809
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,519
the redstone level then this is level 3
level 4 and then the next faceplate

810
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:20,529
level 4 and then the next faceplate
 

811
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,280
level 4 and then the next faceplate
would start five blocks

812
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,290
would start five blocks
 

813
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,900
would start five blocks
from that so see do we have any more

814
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:27,910
from that so see do we have any more
 

815
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,789
from that so see do we have any more
cordis I think we're running low on

816
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:29,799
cordis I think we're running low on
 

817
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,490
cordis I think we're running low on
quarts I need to get more cords that's

818
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:32,500
quarts I need to get more cords that's
 

819
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,700
quarts I need to get more cords that's
like the worst block to get so one two

820
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,710
like the worst block to get so one two
 

821
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,980
like the worst block to get so one two
three four the next face plates in

822
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:39,990
three four the next face plates in
 

823
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,810
three four the next face plates in
relation to this would start here then

824
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:44,820
relation to this would start here then
 

825
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,000
relation to this would start here then
so they go up four blocks and the stairs

826
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,010
so they go up four blocks and the stairs
 

827
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,669
so they go up four blocks and the stairs
go over top like that all right

828
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:52,679
go over top like that all right
 

829
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,110
go over top like that all right
so somehow we need to tie that in and I

830
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,120
so somehow we need to tie that in and I
 

831
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,180
so somehow we need to tie that in and I
think I'm going to try make up a

832
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,190
think I'm going to try make up a
 

833
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,720
think I'm going to try make up a
platform up I to so we can walk and

834
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:03,730
platform up I to so we can walk and
 

835
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,350
platform up I to so we can walk and
access the the droppers in the chests

836
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
access the the droppers in the chests
 

837
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,700
access the the droppers in the chests
like we can down here so there would be

838
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:08,710
like we can down here so there would be
 

839
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,330
like we can down here so there would be
a platform sticking out a little bit

840
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:12,340
a platform sticking out a little bit
 

841
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,390
a platform sticking out a little bit
higher here like at this level sticking

842
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,400
higher here like at this level sticking
 

843
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,340
higher here like at this level sticking
out at least two blocks I would think

844
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,350
out at least two blocks I would think
 

845
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,620
out at least two blocks I would think
maybe three hopefully that's not too bad

846
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:22,630
maybe three hopefully that's not too bad
 

847
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,810
maybe three hopefully that's not too bad
that'll give you that that should give

848
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:24,820
that'll give you that that should give
 

849
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,919
that'll give you that that should give
you an idea of the height of the

850
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:25,929
you an idea of the height of the
 

851
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:31,289
you an idea of the height of the
building but yeah anyways guys we'll

852
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:31,299
building but yeah anyways guys we'll
 

853
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:32,820
building but yeah anyways guys we'll
have to work on this another day because

854
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:32,830
have to work on this another day because
 

855
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,169
have to work on this another day because
we're we don't have the courts or

856
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:34,179
we're we don't have the courts or
 

857
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:36,030
we're we don't have the courts or
anything to really play around with it

858
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,040
anything to really play around with it
 

859
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,260
anything to really play around with it
but we'll have to try make something

860
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,270
but we'll have to try make something
 

861
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,539
but we'll have to try make something
cool like in these five blocks between

862
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:42,549
cool like in these five blocks between
 

863
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,039
cool like in these five blocks between
and try make it look good it would

864
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,049
and try make it look good it would
 

865
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,110
and try make it look good it would
probably look better if like I move that

866
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
probably look better if like I move that
 

867
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,750
probably look better if like I move that
back a block or two so it's not

868
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
back a block or two so it's not
 

869
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,409
back a block or two so it's not
perfectly straight all the way up but

870
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:54,419
perfectly straight all the way up but
 

871
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,780
perfectly straight all the way up but
for the simplicity sake of the project

872
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:57,790
for the simplicity sake of the project
 

873
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,860
for the simplicity sake of the project
I'm not going to do that I'm going to

874
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm not going to do that I'm going to
 

875
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,980
I'm not going to do that I'm going to
keep it straight because all the

876
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:01,990
keep it straight because all the
 

877
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,260
keep it straight because all the
redstone in the back and stuff in the

878
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,270
redstone in the back and stuff in the
 

879
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,750
redstone in the back and stuff in the
water streams I think I'll just be

880
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:06,760
water streams I think I'll just be
 

881
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,700
water streams I think I'll just be
easier if everything is straight and and

882
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:08,710
easier if everything is straight and and
 

883
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,510
easier if everything is straight and and
easy to figure out um

884
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
easy to figure out um
 

885
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,370
easy to figure out um
because like oops this middle part the

886
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:17,380
because like oops this middle part the
 

887
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,919
because like oops this middle part the
redstone from this side of the panel and

888
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:19,929
redstone from this side of the panel and
 

889
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,930
redstone from this side of the panel and
and this one are pretty much going to be

890
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:21,940
and this one are pretty much going to be
 

891
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,659
and this one are pretty much going to be
touching in the middle here and we can't

892
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:24,669
touching in the middle here and we can't
 

893
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,850
touching in the middle here and we can't
move them any closer together we could

894
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:26,860
move them any closer together we could
 

895
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,470
move them any closer together we could
only move them further apart so yeah to

896
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,480
only move them further apart so yeah to
 

897
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,390
only move them further apart so yeah to
keep things smaller it's it's just

898
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,400
keep things smaller it's it's just
 

899
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,150
keep things smaller it's it's just
better to keep it all straight

900
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,160
better to keep it all straight
 

901
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,169
better to keep it all straight
anyway I'm right

902
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:37,179
anyway I'm right
 

903
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:38,669
anyway I'm right
let's get to the comment for today this

928
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:09,849
ton of food with me either it is nice to
 

929
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,969

have an instant health boost after you

930
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:11,979
have an instant health boost after you
 

931
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:14,460

eat if you're down to one heart now and

932
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,470
eat if you're down to one heart now and
 

933
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,589
eat if you're down to one heart now and
you're in the middle of several mobs

934
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:16,599
you're in the middle of several mobs
 

935
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,930
you're in the middle of several mobs
then you have practically no chance of

936
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:18,940
then you have practically no chance of
 

937
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,869
then you have practically no chance of
surviving if your food is down I also

938
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:21,879
surviving if your food is down I also
 

939
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,570
surviving if your food is down I also
like how in the old patches you could

940
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:24,580
like how in the old patches you could
 

941
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,930
like how in the old patches you could
instantly eat the food okay I think I

942
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:27,940
instantly eat the food okay I think I
 

943
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,359
instantly eat the food okay I think I
get that like if you're being swarmed by

944
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,369
get that like if you're being swarmed by
 

945
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:34,080
get that like if you're being swarmed by
mobs before you could just like eat um

946
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,090
mobs before you could just like eat um
 

947
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,460
mobs before you could just like eat um
