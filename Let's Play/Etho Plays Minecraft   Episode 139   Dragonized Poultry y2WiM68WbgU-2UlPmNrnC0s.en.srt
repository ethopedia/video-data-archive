53
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,190

and the the issue is

and the the issue is
 

55
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,390
and the the issue is
normally in the game it will

56
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
normally in the game it will

these
for some reason it decides to close them

72
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
for some reason it decides to close them
 

73
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,270
for some reason it decides to close them
because they're not being powered right

74
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
because they're not being powered right
 

75
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,429
because they're not being powered right
now

76
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
now
 

77
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,749
now
which is a big issue if you're doing

78
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
which is a big issue if you're doing
 

79
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,830
which is a big issue if you're doing
anything mob related with these things

80
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
anything mob related with these things
 

81
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,190
anything mob related with these things
like a lot of people do so

82
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
like a lot of people do so
 

83
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,870
like a lot of people do so
or if you're using these for conveyor

84
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
or if you're using these for conveyor
 

85
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,030
or if you're using these for conveyor
belts or any other design you have to

86
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
belts or any other design you have to
 

87
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,069
belts or any other design you have to
take that into consideration now

88
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
take that into consideration now
 

89
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,830
take that into consideration now
if that doesn't get fixed that's a

90
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
if that doesn't get fixed that's a
 

91
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,190
if that doesn't get fixed that's a
pretty big issue

92
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
pretty big issue
 

93
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,350
pretty big issue
uh so all of these will eventually all

94
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
uh so all of these will eventually all
 

95
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,709
uh so all of these will eventually all
close on their own because they're not

96
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
close on their own because they're not
 

97
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,749
close on their own because they're not
being powered

98
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759

 

99
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,230

so for this what i'm gonna do to fix is

100
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
so for this what i'm gonna do to fix is
 

101
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,389
so for this what i'm gonna do to fix is
just use science and get rid of these

102
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
just use science and get rid of these
 

103
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,070
just use science and get rid of these
but just something i thought i'd point

104
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
but just something i thought i'd point
 

105
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,229
but just something i thought i'd point
out to you guys hopefully it gets fixed

106
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
out to you guys hopefully it gets fixed
 

107
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,869
out to you guys hopefully it gets fixed
in a

108
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
in a
 

109
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,390
in a
new patch

110
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400

 

111
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,309

all right so the thing i was trying here

112
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
all right so the thing i was trying here
 

113
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,830
all right so the thing i was trying here
doesn't seem to be working

114
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
doesn't seem to be working
 

115
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,550
doesn't seem to be working
quite like i hoped it would this was

116
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
quite like i hoped it would this was
 

117
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,589
quite like i hoped it would this was
just

118
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
just
 

119
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,110
just
a test to see how it would function

120
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
a test to see how it would function
 

121
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,550
a test to see how it would function
i've been trying to set this up without

122
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
i've been trying to set this up without
 

123
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,229
i've been trying to set this up without
using any pistons to move

124
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
using any pistons to move
 

125
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,150
using any pistons to move
the blaze around and i i have signs

126
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
the blaze around and i i have signs
 

127
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,949
the blaze around and i i have signs
there now that's to help decrease the

128
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
there now that's to help decrease the
 

129
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,229
there now that's to help decrease the
time it takes them to

130
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
time it takes them to
 

131
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,270
time it takes them to
fall down the center and that does help

132
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
fall down the center and that does help
 

133
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,949
fall down the center and that does help
but i don't know just relying on their

134
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
but i don't know just relying on their
 

135
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,550
but i don't know just relying on their
pathfinding alone

136
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
pathfinding alone
 

137
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,350
pathfinding alone
to get their way through takes too long

138
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
to get their way through takes too long
 

139
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,710
to get their way through takes too long
they kind of get stuck in places

140
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
they kind of get stuck in places
 

141
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,710
they kind of get stuck in places
um they will eventually find their way

142
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
um they will eventually find their way
 

143
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,869
um they will eventually find their way
through but it just takes a while

144
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
through but it just takes a while
 

145
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,229
through but it just takes a while
so i'm trying to get them to fall down

146
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239

 

147
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,390

and then go to the end of this tube and

148
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
and then go to the end of this tube and
 

149
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,589
and then go to the end of this tube and
then they would

150
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
then they would
 

151
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,670
then they would
join together and go down another tube

152
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
join together and go down another tube
 

153
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,869
join together and go down another tube
and then up

154
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
and then up
 

155
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,949
and then up
is what i would like to happen

156
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959

 

157
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,229

but yeah they just

158
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239

 

159
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,750

i don't know i have to use pistons i

160
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
i don't know i have to use pistons i
 

161
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,070
i don't know i have to use pistons i
guess i've been trying to avoid using

162
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
guess i've been trying to avoid using
 

163
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,309
guess i've been trying to avoid using
them because

164
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
them because
 

165
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,030
them because
for one thing they like the game a bit

166
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
for one thing they like the game a bit
 

167
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
for one thing they like the game a bit
um

168
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
um
 

169
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,470
um
they you have to choose one of

170
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
they you have to choose one of
 

171
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,229
they you have to choose one of
two negative effects if you have a

172
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
two negative effects if you have a
 

173
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,070
two negative effects if you have a
piston

174
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080

 

175
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,990

and a solid block to push them

176
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000

 

177
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,229

it pushes them good occasionally they

178
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
it pushes them good occasionally they
 

179
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,350
it pushes them good occasionally they
will glitch into

180
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
will glitch into
 

181
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,070
will glitch into
the solid block and then suffocate to

182
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
the solid block and then suffocate to
 

183
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,910
the solid block and then suffocate to
death

184
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
death
 

185
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,030
death
which is kind of a good thing but the

186
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
which is kind of a good thing but the
 

187
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,990
which is kind of a good thing but the
other

188
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
other
 

189
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,750
other
issue is just sometimes when they get

190
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
issue is just sometimes when they get
 

191
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,429
issue is just sometimes when they get
pushed by the solid block they take a

192
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
pushed by the solid block they take a
 

193
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,949
pushed by the solid block they take a
little bit of damage

194
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
little bit of damage
 

195
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,550
little bit of damage
for a split second they will take

196
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
for a split second they will take
 

197
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,789
for a split second they will take
suffocation damage as

198
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
suffocation damage as
 

199
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,630
suffocation damage as
as it pushes them

200
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640

 

201
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,390

and that's why with my other blaze farm

202
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
and that's why with my other blaze farm
 

203
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,990
and that's why with my other blaze farm
there that they didn't all have the same

204
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
there that they didn't all have the same
 

205
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,390
there that they didn't all have the same
health

206
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
health
 

207
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,309
health
because some of them took damage as they

208
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
because some of them took damage as they
 

209
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,990
because some of them took damage as they
were getting pushed around

210
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
were getting pushed around
 

211
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,509
were getting pushed around
now if you were to push them with a

212
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
now if you were to push them with a
 

213
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,190
now if you were to push them with a
glass block

214
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
glass block
 

215
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,430
glass block
they would take no damage from that but

216
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
they would take no damage from that but
 

217
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,030
they would take no damage from that but
sometimes

218
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
sometimes
 

219
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,830
sometimes
they get stuck inside it their head and

220
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
they get stuck inside it their head and
 

221
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,909
they get stuck inside it their head and
they'll be on a

222
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
they'll be on a
 

223
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,590
they'll be on a
on the pressure plate at the same time

224
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
on the pressure plate at the same time
 

225
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,510
on the pressure plate at the same time
too

226
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
too
 

227
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,070
too
and they will totally jam up the system

228
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
and they will totally jam up the system
 

229
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,510
and they will totally jam up the system
so

230
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520

 

231
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,110

there's no good way of moving these guys

232
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
there's no good way of moving these guys
 

233
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,670
there's no good way of moving these guys
around basically

234
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
around basically
 

235
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,390
around basically
which kind of sucks mine carts you can

236
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
which kind of sucks mine carts you can
 

237
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,390
which kind of sucks mine carts you can
only do one at a time

238
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
only do one at a time
 

239
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,030
only do one at a time
what i was thinking of maybe doing is

240
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
what i was thinking of maybe doing is
 

241
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,110
what i was thinking of maybe doing is
pushing them through my tunnel here with

242
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
pushing them through my tunnel here with
 

243
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,990
pushing them through my tunnel here with
the furnace minecarts but then

244
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
the furnace minecarts but then
 

245
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,710
the furnace minecarts but then
i did try that in creative mode and it

246
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
i did try that in creative mode and it
 

247
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790
i did try that in creative mode and it
worked well but the problem is

248
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
worked well but the problem is
 

249
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,909
worked well but the problem is
you have to keep feeding it coal but it

250
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
you have to keep feeding it coal but it
 

251
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,670
you have to keep feeding it coal but it
is a good way of moving them around

252
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
is a good way of moving them around
 

253
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,590
is a good way of moving them around
long distance like a whole group of them

254
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600

 

255
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,270

so yeah i'll have to adjust this

256
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
so yeah i'll have to adjust this
 

257
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,550
so yeah i'll have to adjust this
use pistons and probably have to do that

258
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
use pistons and probably have to do that
 

259
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,590
use pistons and probably have to do that
another day because that will take a

260
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
another day because that will take a
 

261
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,670
another day because that will take a
while

262
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
while
 

263
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,270
while
oh yeah and with these uh the doors and

264
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
oh yeah and with these uh the doors and
 

265
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,870
oh yeah and with these uh the doors and
the trapdoors don't seem to be closing

266
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
the trapdoors don't seem to be closing
 

267
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,670
the trapdoors don't seem to be closing
on their own but

268
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
on their own but
 

269
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,189
on their own but
i haven't given it a ton of time either

270
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
i haven't given it a ton of time either
 

271
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,350
i haven't given it a ton of time either
although if you put a block next to them

272
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
although if you put a block next to them
 

273
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,310
although if you put a block next to them
and remove it

274
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320

 

275
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,430

then they'll close on their own

276
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
then they'll close on their own
 

277
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,029
then they'll close on their own
this door is open right now if you put a

278
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
this door is open right now if you put a
 

279
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,430
this door is open right now if you put a
block next to it and remove it

280
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
block next to it and remove it
 

281
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:47,590
block next to it and remove it
it'll close on its own too

282
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600

 

283
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,950

all right we're back here and

284
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
all right we're back here and
 

285
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,469
all right we're back here and
i have been doing a little bit of

286
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
i have been doing a little bit of
 

287
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,310
i have been doing a little bit of
polishing around here

288
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
polishing around here
 

289
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,990
polishing around here
with the cave trying to

290
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
with the cave trying to
 

291
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,189
with the cave trying to
figure things out a little bit better um

292
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
figure things out a little bit better um
 

293
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,110
figure things out a little bit better um
so before here you would have to go up

294
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
so before here you would have to go up
 

295
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,270
so before here you would have to go up
and then back down and now i just cut a

296
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
and then back down and now i just cut a
 

297
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,350
and then back down and now i just cut a
slice out of the cliff here and just

298
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
slice out of the cliff here and just
 

299
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,790
slice out of the cliff here and just
walk straight pretty much

300
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800

 

301
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,230

so probably going to

302
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
so probably going to
 

303
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,909
so probably going to
either get rid of this mushroom farm

304
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
either get rid of this mushroom farm
 

305
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
either get rid of this mushroom farm
here or move it over one block just

306
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
here or move it over one block just
 

307
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,110
here or move it over one block just
to make its symmetrical

308
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
to make its symmetrical
 

309
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,230
to make its symmetrical
this is uh

310
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240

 

311
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,749

that's where the pressure plate is right

312
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
that's where the pressure plate is right
 

313
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,909
that's where the pressure plate is right
there i would like that

314
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
there i would like that
 

315
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,830
there i would like that
to be in the middle of the walkway here

316
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
to be in the middle of the walkway here
 

317
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,909
to be in the middle of the walkway here
and maybe in one block

318
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
and maybe in one block
 

319
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,909
and maybe in one block
not that i really use that but

320
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919

 

321
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,870

it would be nice to be aligned properly

322
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
it would be nice to be aligned properly
 

323
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,710
it would be nice to be aligned properly
i did a little bit on the ceiling

324
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720

 

325
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,830

i added this wooden stripe on this side

326
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
i added this wooden stripe on this side
 

327
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,430
i added this wooden stripe on this side
people never really told me if they like

328
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
people never really told me if they like
 

329
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,950
people never really told me if they like
it or not i i kind of like it because it

330
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
it or not i i kind of like it because it
 

331
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,070
it or not i i kind of like it because it
creates harmony i guess with the floor

332
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080

 

333
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,870

but i would like to have these all along

334
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
but i would like to have these all along
 

335
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,150
but i would like to have these all along
the walls

336
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
the walls
 

337
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,469
the walls
wooden stripe and then another brick

338
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
wooden stripe and then another brick
 

339
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,350
wooden stripe and then another brick
stripe

340
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
stripe
 

341
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,629
stripe
sandstone stripe might be a few too many

342
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
sandstone stripe might be a few too many
 

343
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,350
sandstone stripe might be a few too many
stripes but

344

was to get rid of the stairs
in this slime escalator thing

in this slime escalator thing
 

431

in this slime escalator thing
and replace them with these half slabs

i'll probably put one over here and see

534
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
i'll probably put one over here and see
 

535
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,430
i'll probably put one over here and see
how that goes

536
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
how that goes
 

537
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,150

need an eight by eight

538
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160

 

539
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,509

eight by eight this wall is 13 wide

540
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
eight by eight this wall is 13 wide
 

541
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,550
eight by eight this wall is 13 wide
so it's not going to be symmetrical

542
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
so it's not going to be symmetrical
 

543
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,750
so it's not going to be symmetrical
another problem but

544
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
another problem but
 

545
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,350
another problem but
i will play around with it and we'll see

546
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
i will play around with it and we'll see

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,150
i will play around with it and we'll see
how it goes

548
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160

 

549
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,269

alright you ready for it here it is

550
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
alright you ready for it here it is
 

551
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,949
alright you ready for it here it is
here's the pixel arts

552
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959

 

553
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,750

looks looks pretty good um i had a

554
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
looks looks pretty good um i had a
 

555
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:41,990
looks looks pretty good um i had a
little

556
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
little
 

557
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,310
little
trouble lighting it as the one issue so

558
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
trouble lighting it as the one issue so
 

559
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,949
trouble lighting it as the one issue so
i put a wood frame around it

560
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
i put a wood frame around it
 

561
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,470
i put a wood frame around it
with glowstone every so blocks um

562
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
with glowstone every so blocks um
 

563
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,990
with glowstone every so blocks um
don't really like how the glowstone

564
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
don't really like how the glowstone
 

565
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,190
don't really like how the glowstone
looks i could have inset the picture one

566
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
looks i could have inset the picture one
 

567
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,110
looks i could have inset the picture one
more block but then

568
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
more block but then
 

569
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,790
more block but then
and like have glowstone hidden on the

570
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
and like have glowstone hidden on the
 

571
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,870
and like have glowstone hidden on the
inside

572
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
inside
 

573
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,470
inside
but then it would have been a lot harder

574
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
but then it would have been a lot harder
 

575
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,069
but then it would have been a lot harder
to see the picture i think

576
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
to see the picture i think
 

577
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,870
to see the picture i think
if it was in one more block the frame

578
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
if it was in one more block the frame
 

579
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,870
if it was in one more block the frame
would cover it up more so

580
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
would cover it up more so
 

581
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,670
would cover it up more so
so i think i'll leave it like that it

582
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
so i think i'll leave it like that it
 

583
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,350
so i think i'll leave it like that it
would be nice if i could put trapdoors

584
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
would be nice if i could put trapdoors
 

585
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,910
would be nice if i could put trapdoors
over

586
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
over
 

587
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,990
over
the glowstone to make them a little bit

588
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
the glowstone to make them a little bit
 

589
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,190
the glowstone to make them a little bit
less

590
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200

 

591
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,990

sticking out like a sore thumb i guess

592
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000

 

593
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,190

oh that's kind of cool

594
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200

 

595
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,030

so i don't know if i'm going to put more

596
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
so i don't know if i'm going to put more
 

597
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,269
so i don't know if i'm going to put more
here i might but the problem is i have

598
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
here i might but the problem is i have
 

599
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,910
here i might but the problem is i have
uh

600
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920

fly down and somehow get messed up
 

1081
