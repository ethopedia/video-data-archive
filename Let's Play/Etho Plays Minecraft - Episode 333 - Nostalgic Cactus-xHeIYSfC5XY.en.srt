I'm planning to let's see where is the

162
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm planning to let's see where is the
 

163
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm planning to let's see where is the
river the river is up here right

164
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,610
river the river is up here right
 

165
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,810
river the river is up here right
and this just dead ends which I don't

166
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:51,820
and this just dead ends which I don't
 

167
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,110
and this just dead ends which I don't
really like either so my plan is that

168
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
really like either so my plan is that
 

169
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,550
really like either so my plan is that
area is right above here you see how

170
00:04:59,550 --> 00:04:59,560
area is right above here you see how
 

171
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,350
area is right above here you see how
it's dripping water down I'm gonna make

172
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
it's dripping water down I'm gonna make
 

173
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,870
it's dripping water down I'm gonna make
a waterfall here and then I hollowed out

174
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:03,880
a waterfall here and then I hollowed out
 

175
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,710
a waterfall here and then I hollowed out
underneath the stairs right there so the

176
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:07,720
underneath the stairs right there so the
 

177
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,090
underneath the stairs right there so the
water will go under we'll have like a

178
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,100
water will go under we'll have like a
 

179
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,480
water will go under we'll have like a
river then I hollowed out this area too

180
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,490
river then I hollowed out this area too
 

181
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,070
river then I hollowed out this area too
before there was just a solid wall here

182
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,080
before there was just a solid wall here
 

183
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,140
before there was just a solid wall here
which looked pretty plain so we're gonna

184
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,150
which looked pretty plain so we're gonna
 

185
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,930
which looked pretty plain so we're gonna
have a river that runs through then have

186
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:21,940
have a river that runs through then have
 

187
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,610
have a river that runs through then have
like a little waterfall here and it will

188
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:23,620
like a little waterfall here and it will
 

189
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,330
like a little waterfall here and it will
end up by the fishing shack so I brought

190
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:27,340
end up by the fishing shack so I brought
 

191
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,909
end up by the fishing shack so I brought
some ice I'm gonna do that we'll see

192
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
some ice I'm gonna do that we'll see
 

193
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,350
some ice I'm gonna do that we'll see
what it looks like well it turned out

194
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,360
what it looks like well it turned out
 

195
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,200
what it looks like well it turned out
okay it's not perfect though like this

196
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,210
okay it's not perfect though like this
 

197
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,330
okay it's not perfect though like this
there's a few things budging me about it

198
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:39,340
there's a few things budging me about it
 

199
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,300
there's a few things budging me about it
mostly this waterfall but yeah we got a

200
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,310
mostly this waterfall but yeah we got a
 

201
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,000
mostly this waterfall but yeah we got a
waterfall here now and then it goes

202
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,010
waterfall here now and then it goes
 

203
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,480
waterfall here now and then it goes
under under the walkway and this is the

204
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,490
under under the walkway and this is the
 

205
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,610
under under the walkway and this is the
new River area the river is pretty

206
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:50,620
new River area the river is pretty
 

207
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,270
new River area the river is pretty
hidden which I I kind of liked actually

208
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
hidden which I I kind of liked actually
 

209
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,860
hidden which I I kind of liked actually
just through a bunch of random wheaten

210
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:55,870
just through a bunch of random wheaten
 

211
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,840
just through a bunch of random wheaten
and grass and stuff down here bushes

212
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,850
and grass and stuff down here bushes
 

213
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,230
and grass and stuff down here bushes
some hidden lighting the lighting is

214
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,240
some hidden lighting the lighting is
 

215
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,719
some hidden lighting the lighting is
very close there's a few spots I think

216
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:03,729
very close there's a few spots I think
 

217
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,460
very close there's a few spots I think
that can still spawn mobs so I'll have

218
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,470
that can still spawn mobs so I'll have
 

219
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,839
that can still spawn mobs so I'll have
to deal with those this water stream

220
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:09,849
to deal with those this water stream
 

221
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,550
to deal with those this water stream
here or waterfall turned out pretty good

222
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,560
here or waterfall turned out pretty good
 

223
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,149
here or waterfall turned out pretty good
I like this one uh-huh

224
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:15,159
I like this one uh-huh
 

225
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,239
I like this one uh-huh
but the thing is up over here oh yeah I

226
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:18,249
but the thing is up over here oh yeah I
 

227
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,689
but the thing is up over here oh yeah I
almost I might change this grass up with

228
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:21,699
almost I might change this grass up with
 

229
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,459
almost I might change this grass up with
Basel yet too because I don't feel

230
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:23,469
Basel yet too because I don't feel
 

231
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,320
Basel yet too because I don't feel
there's enough distinction between the

232
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,330
there's enough distinction between the
 

233
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,619
there's enough distinction between the
path and the side of it you know because

234
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:28,629
path and the side of it you know because
 

235
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,079
path and the side of it you know because
they're the same color and all that but

236
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,089
they're the same color and all that but
 

237
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,909
they're the same color and all that but
this I would have really liked to put

238
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
this I would have really liked to put
 

239
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,969
this I would have really liked to put
the waterfall back a little ways but

240
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:35,979
the waterfall back a little ways but
 

241
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,339
the waterfall back a little ways but
then I kind of realized this area

242
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:38,349
then I kind of realized this area
 

243
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,719
then I kind of realized this area
wouldn't look so good because

244
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:41,729
wouldn't look so good because
 

245
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,540
wouldn't look so good because
particularly like how the water feels

246
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,550
particularly like how the water feels
 

247
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,699
particularly like how the water feels
like it goes down to the left here and

248
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:47,709
like it goes down to the left here and
 

249
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,459
like it goes down to the left here and
if I was to bump this back like I'd have

250
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:50,469
if I was to bump this back like I'd have
 

251
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,859
if I was to bump this back like I'd have
to cut it like right there and I don't

252
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:52,869
to cut it like right there and I don't
 

253
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:53,820
to cut it like right there and I don't
think that would look as good when

254
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:53,830
think that would look as good when
 

255
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,980
think that would look as good when
you're coming down these stairs so will

256
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:55,990
you're coming down these stairs so will
 

257
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,719
you're coming down these stairs so will
this try that out for now and I might

258
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:57,729
this try that out for now and I might
 

259
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,149
this try that out for now and I might
make some adjustments while I was

260
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:00,159
make some adjustments while I was
 

261
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:03,889
make some adjustments while I was
working here I noticed another problem

262
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:03,899
working here I noticed another problem
 

263
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,040
working here I noticed another problem
yeah it turns out I should have expected

264
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,050
yeah it turns out I should have expected
 

265
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,319
yeah it turns out I should have expected
this but I didn't think of it the

266
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,329
this but I didn't think of it the
 

267
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,319
this but I didn't think of it the
minecart physics changes have broken a

268
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:13,329
minecart physics changes have broken a
 

269
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,149
minecart physics changes have broken a
lot of things such as this thing

270
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:17,159
lot of things such as this thing
 

271
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,329
lot of things such as this thing
sometimes sometimes it works because

272
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:21,339
sometimes sometimes it works because
 

273
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,980
sometimes sometimes it works because
they derail because it's flying by at

274
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:22,990
they derail because it's flying by at
 

275
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,019
they derail because it's flying by at
that time it works there we go it flew

276
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:28,029
that time it works there we go it flew
 

277
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,119
that time it works there we go it flew
off so yeah I don't know we're gonna

278
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,129
off so yeah I don't know we're gonna
 

279
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,329
off so yeah I don't know we're gonna
have to come up with a fix for this so

280
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:36,339
have to come up with a fix for this so
 

281
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,619
have to come up with a fix for this so
I'm gonna try a few things off camera

282
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:37,629
I'm gonna try a few things off camera
 

283
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,730
I'm gonna try a few things off camera
and off hopefully I'll come up with

284
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:38,740
and off hopefully I'll come up with
 

285
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:46,949
and off hopefully I'll come up with
something yep all right

286
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:46,959
something yep all right
 

287
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,619
something yep all right
I'm having trouble here this is very

invisible rail here it all makes sense

306
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:20,649
invisible rail here it all makes sense
 

307
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:23,719
invisible rail here it all makes sense
now

308
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:23,729

thought I had it boom beautiful do it
 

315
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,070

318
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:41,610
works perfect uh-huh guess what if I
 

319
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,000
works perfect uh-huh guess what if I
change it to a hopper minecart it has

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,010
change it to a hopper minecart it has
 

321
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,699
change it to a hopper minecart it has
different physics now they used to well

322
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:46,709
different physics now they used to well
 

323
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,050
different physics now they used to well
I thought they were the same before at

324
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,060
I thought they were the same before at
 

325
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:59,930
I thought they were the same before at
least yeah there goes all right well it

326
00:08:59,930 --> 00:08:59,940
least yeah there goes all right well it
 

327
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,660
least yeah there goes all right well it
seems to work now I ended up just kind

328
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:02,670
seems to work now I ended up just kind
 

329
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,400
seems to work now I ended up just kind
of getting fed up I tore everything else

330
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,410
of getting fed up I tore everything else
 

331
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,800
of getting fed up I tore everything else
redid it with regular rails and just

332
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:06,810
redid it with regular rails and just
 

333
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,240
redid it with regular rails and just
slowed it all down it doesn't need to be

334
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,250
slowed it all down it doesn't need to be
 

335
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,370
slowed it all down it doesn't need to be
quick so yeah it's fine like this

336
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:12,380
quick so yeah it's fine like this
 

337
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,230
quick so yeah it's fine like this
cool cool so I ended up doing the second

338
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
cool cool so I ended up doing the second
 

339
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,610
cool cool so I ended up doing the second
one here a little bit differently

340
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,620
one here a little bit differently
 

341
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,259
one here a little bit differently
because it's facing a different

342
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:21,269
because it's facing a different
 

343
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,259
because it's facing a different
direction the minecart was behaving

344
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:24,269
direction the minecart was behaving
 

345
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,139
direction the minecart was behaving
differently so there's no power rails in

346
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:27,149
differently so there's no power rails in
 

347
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,579
differently so there's no power rails in
the last two rows there I really have to

348
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:28,589
the last two rows there I really have to
 

349
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,850
the last two rows there I really have to
slow it down and even even then it's

350
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:31,860
slow it down and even even then it's
 

351
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,560
slow it down and even even then it's
still going pretty quick tip in there

352
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,570

 

353
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,210

and there is definitely a huge

354
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
and there is definitely a huge
 

355
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,660
and there is definitely a huge
difference between normal like empty

356
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:41,670
difference between normal like empty
 

357
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,240
difference between normal like empty
mine carts and hopper mine carts look at

358
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,250
mine carts and hopper mine carts look at
 

359
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,690
mine carts and hopper mine carts look at
this the empty minecart goes way way

360
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:50,700
this the empty minecart goes way way
 

361
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,139
this the empty minecart goes way way
slower and it's gonna get stuck on there

362
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:54,149
slower and it's gonna get stuck on there
 

363
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,410
slower and it's gonna get stuck on there
even it's that slow you know what I want

364
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,420
even it's that slow you know what I want
 

365
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,430
even it's that slow you know what I want
to try a check storage minecart to see

366
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
to try a check storage minecart to see
 

367
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,050
to try a check storage minecart to see
how they compare I'm guessing it'll

368
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,060
how they compare I'm guessing it'll
 

369
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,220
how they compare I'm guessing it'll
behave the same as a hopper mine carts

370
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,230
behave the same as a hopper mine carts
 

371
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,170
behave the same as a hopper mine carts
in terms of keeping its momentum but we

372
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,180
in terms of keeping its momentum but we
 

373
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,310
in terms of keeping its momentum but we
will see all right it's good to know

374
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,320
will see all right it's good to know
 

375
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,260
will see all right it's good to know
these things

376
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,270
these things
 

377
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,460
these things
and the crafting table it's like where

378
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,470
and the crafting table it's like where
 

379
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,840
and the crafting table it's like where
did I put that crafting table I just

380
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,850
did I put that crafting table I just
 

381
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,720
did I put that crafting table I just
looked at it I didn't place it oh no I

382
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:23,730
looked at it I didn't place it oh no I
 

383
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,100
looked at it I didn't place it oh no I
don't even need a crafting table what am

384
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,110
don't even need a crafting table what am
 

385
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,770
don't even need a crafting table what am
i doing I had the chest all right

386
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:29,780
i doing I had the chest all right
 

387
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:36,260
i doing I had the chest all right
yeah it's much quicker yeah same as

388
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,270
yeah it's much quicker yeah same as
 

389
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,390
yeah it's much quicker yeah same as
hopper minecart uh-huh

390
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:38,400
hopper minecart uh-huh
 

391
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,530
hopper minecart uh-huh
what about if I ride it I wonder if

392
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,540
what about if I ride it I wonder if
 

393
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,010
what about if I ride it I wonder if
that's gonna be the same this is a bad

394
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,020
that's gonna be the same this is a bad
 

395
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,500
that's gonna be the same this is a bad
idea I feels about the same as the

396
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,510
idea I feels about the same as the
 

397
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,760
idea I feels about the same as the
hopper minecart to you I guess it's just

398
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:52,770
hopper minecart to you I guess it's just
 

399
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,580
hopper minecart to you I guess it's just
empty carts oh no no it behaved

400
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,590
empty carts oh no no it behaved
 

401
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,830
empty carts oh no no it behaved
differently look we'd be derailed uh-huh

402
00:10:59,830 --> 00:10:59,840
differently look we'd be derailed uh-huh
 

403
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,950
differently look we'd be derailed uh-huh
so it goes even quicker I'm pretty sure

404
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:03,960
so it goes even quicker I'm pretty sure
 

405
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,320
so it goes even quicker I'm pretty sure
that means it was quicker if the players

406
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,330
that means it was quicker if the players
 

407
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,440
that means it was quicker if the players
riding it compared to storage mine carts

408
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,450
riding it compared to storage mine carts
 

409
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,380
riding it compared to storage mine carts
and the hopper mine carts anyway so

410
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,390
and the hopper mine carts anyway so
 

411
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,000
and the hopper mine carts anyway so
we're gonna we're gonna get out of this

412
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,010
we're gonna we're gonna get out of this
 

413
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,490
we're gonna we're gonna get out of this
cave guys I'm sick of being in here so

414
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,500
cave guys I'm sick of being in here so
 

415
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,340

dark so gloomy it's a little nicer up

416
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,350
dark so gloomy it's a little nicer up
 

417
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,040

nostalgic project a little out of the
 

421
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,300
nostalgic project a little out of the
ordinary it's not gonna be too efficient

422
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,310
ordinary it's not gonna be too efficient
 

423
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,430
ordinary it's not gonna be too efficient
but we're gonna be making a cactus farm

424
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
but we're gonna be making a cactus farm
 

425
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,050
but we're gonna be making a cactus farm
I don't have a tectus firm in my world

426
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,060
I don't have a tectus firm in my world
 

427
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,990
I don't have a tectus firm in my world
yet and one of the very first things I

428
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
yet and one of the very first things I
 

429
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,970
yet and one of the very first things I
ever built in Minecraft I don't know how

430
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:37,980
ever built in Minecraft I don't know how
 

431
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,710
ever built in Minecraft I don't know how
many of you know this but I made a giant

432
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:39,720
many of you know this but I made a giant
 

433
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,950
many of you know this but I made a giant
cactus farm and we're gonna replicate it

434
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:42,960
cactus farm and we're gonna replicate it
 

435
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,940
cactus farm and we're gonna replicate it
to some extent

436
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:43,950
to some extent
 

437
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,690
to some extent
in our world here so static for me this

438
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:47,700
in our world here so static for me this
 

439
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,550
in our world here so static for me this
is before my time with you guys though

440
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:49,560
is before my time with you guys though
 

441
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,940
is before my time with you guys though
so a lot of you most of you have never

442

so a lot of you most of you have never
 

443
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,130
so a lot of you most of you have never
seen this before even in my old world

444
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,140
seen this before even in my old world
 

445
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,460
seen this before even in my old world
old old world not my like first let's

446
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,470
old old world not my like first let's
 

447
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,580
old old world not my like first let's
play world even before that all right so

448
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:04,590
play world even before that all right so
 

449
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,260
play world even before that all right so
I was looking around for a spot for it

450
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,270
I was looking around for a spot for it
 

451
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,610
I was looking around for a spot for it
and I think we're just gonna build it in

452
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:07,620
and I think we're just gonna build it in
 

453
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,430
and I think we're just gonna build it in
the trees this way a little bit it'll be

454
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,440
the trees this way a little bit it'll be
 

455
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,520
the trees this way a little bit it'll be
off on its own I am very sad about one

456
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,530
off on its own I am very sad about one
 

457
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,950

thing though the like my favorite thing
 

459
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,470
thing though the like my favorite thing
about this cactus farm was the sounds it

460
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
about this cactus farm was the sounds it
 

461
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,900
about this cactus farm was the sounds it
made it was very very peaceful very

462

tranquil
because cactus would randomly fall down

466
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,090
because cactus would randomly fall down
 

467
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,320
because cactus would randomly fall down
into water every so often and it was it

468

they removed that quite a while ago

476
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:38,460
they removed that quite a while ago
 

477
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,690
they removed that quite a while ago
actually now that I think of it because

478
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:41,700
actually now that I think of it because
 

479
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,490
actually now that I think of it because
it was causing like the splashing

480
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:43,500
it was causing like the splashing
 

481
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,200
it was causing like the splashing
sound so that kind of kind of stinks for

482
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,210
sound so that kind of kind of stinks for
 

483
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,970
sound so that kind of kind of stinks for
this purpose anyway but we'll still

484
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:49,980
this purpose anyway but we'll still
 

485
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,730
this purpose anyway but we'll still
build it it'll be cool so I think just

486
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:54,740
build it it'll be cool so I think just
 

487
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,890
build it it'll be cool so I think just
let's see I mark the spot somewhere and

488
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:57,900
let's see I mark the spot somewhere and
 

489
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,240
let's see I mark the spot somewhere and
we're gonna build out a brick -

490
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,250
we're gonna build out a brick -
 

491
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,420
we're gonna build out a brick -
originally I made it out of cobblestone

492
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,430
originally I made it out of cobblestone
 

493
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,230
originally I made it out of cobblestone
pretty much the whole thing we're gonna

494
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,240
pretty much the whole thing we're gonna
 

495
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,780
pretty much the whole thing we're gonna
Brittany's brick though it'll look a

496
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:05,790
Brittany's brick though it'll look a
 

497
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,770
Brittany's brick though it'll look a
little nicer

498
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:08,780

 

499
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,510

getrekt that knock back man

500
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,520

 

501
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,510

alright so yeah where is that spot I

502
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,520
alright so yeah where is that spot I
 

503
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,250
alright so yeah where is that spot I
lost it now here it is so I have posted

504
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,260
lost it now here it is so I have posted
 

505
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,740
lost it now here it is so I have posted
two videos of this a long time ago in my

506
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:24,750
two videos of this a long time ago in my
 

507
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,970
two videos of this a long time ago in my
channel so I was able to reference those

508
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:27,980
channel so I was able to reference those
 

509
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,380
channel so I was able to reference those
to figure out the dimensions and stuff

510
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,390
to figure out the dimensions and stuff
 

511
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,330
to figure out the dimensions and stuff
so I should be able to replicate it

512
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,340
so I should be able to replicate it
 

513
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,780
so I should be able to replicate it
pretty well how close how close is it to

514
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:35,790
pretty well how close how close is it to
 

515
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,580
pretty well how close how close is it to
the water here that's a little ways out

516
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,590
the water here that's a little ways out
 

517
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,170
the water here that's a little ways out
still that's good alright so what I can

518
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,180
still that's good alright so what I can
 

519
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,850
still that's good alright so what I can
tell we want a 15 check in my notes yeah

520
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:46,860
tell we want a 15 check in my notes yeah
 

521
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:55,520
tell we want a 15 check in my notes yeah
15 by 15 square so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 plus

522
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:55,530
15 by 15 square so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 plus
 

523
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,740
15 by 15 square so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 plus
7 is 14 plus the 1 in the middle so

524
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:57,750
7 is 14 plus the 1 in the middle so
 

525
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,840
7 is 14 plus the 1 in the middle so
that's about what we want and we will go

526
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:01,850
that's about what we want and we will go
 

527
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,060
that's about what we want and we will go
down a layer oh no this is my bad one

528
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,070
down a layer oh no this is my bad one
 

529
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,990
down a layer oh no this is my bad one
let's use yeah so we'll do a square all

530
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,000
let's use yeah so we'll do a square all
 

531
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,110
let's use yeah so we'll do a square all
around then we're gonna do another

532
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,120
around then we're gonna do another
 

533
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,770
around then we're gonna do another
square up in the air 9 blocks up is what

534
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:15,780
square up in the air 9 blocks up is what
 

535
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,820
square up in the air 9 blocks up is what
it looked like it was and we'll take it

536
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:19,830
it looked like it was and we'll take it
 

537
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:26,930
it looked like it was and we'll take it
from there as in the middle of building

538
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:26,940
from there as in the middle of building
 

539
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,780
from there as in the middle of building
it and I have a problem now whenever I

540
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:29,790
it and I have a problem now whenever I
 

541
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,770
it and I have a problem now whenever I
join my world's my team crashes oh there

542
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:36,780
join my world's my team crashes oh there
 

543
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,860
join my world's my team crashes oh there
we go

544
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:37,870
we go
 

545
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,380
we go
all right we're good never mind so we're

546
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,390
all right we're good never mind so we're
 

547
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,420
all right we're good never mind so we're
in in the game again that was really

548
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,430
in in the game again that was really
 

549
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,390
in in the game again that was really
weird man it loaded weird when I started

550
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:49,400
weird man it loaded weird when I started
 

551
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,030
weird man it loaded weird when I started
it though you notice that how like when

552
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
it though you notice that how like when
 

553
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,680
it though you notice that how like when
I was joining my world all I could see

554
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:53,690
I was joining my world all I could see
 

555
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,450
I was joining my world all I could see
is this one chunk and then it would

556
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:55,460
is this one chunk and then it would
 

557
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:03,190
is this one chunk and then it would
freeze wait to zombies not always now

558
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,200
freeze wait to zombies not always now
 

559
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,810
freeze wait to zombies not always now
now I can't test it cuz it started

560
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:04,820
now I can't test it cuz it started
 

561
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,090
now I can't test it cuz it started
raining that little zombie didn't light

562
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,100
raining that little zombie didn't light
 

563
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,970
raining that little zombie didn't light
me on fire I'm wondering if it's just

564
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:09,980
me on fire I'm wondering if it's just
 

565
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,590
me on fire I'm wondering if it's just
them or if they don't always let you on

566
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
them or if they don't always let you on
 

567
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,060
them or if they don't always let you on
fire now yeah so my team was crashing

568
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,070
fire now yeah so my team was crashing
 

569
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,830
fire now yeah so my team was crashing
then I restarted the launcher though and

570
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:20,840
then I restarted the launcher though and
 

571
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,810
then I restarted the launcher though and
now it works so maybe that was what was

572
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:22,820
now it works so maybe that was what was
 

573
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,200
now it works so maybe that was what was
happening anyway so we got we got the

574
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,210
happening anyway so we got we got the
 

575
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,420
happening anyway so we got we got the
brick square going on here then I I'm

576
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,430
brick square going on here then I I'm
 

577
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,060
brick square going on here then I I'm
doing a second to square around that and

578
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,070
doing a second to square around that and
 

579
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,180
doing a second to square around that and
the cactus they fall in these gaps here

580
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,190
the cactus they fall in these gaps here
 

581
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,820
the cactus they fall in these gaps here
and they'll fall down to the bottom and

582
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:41,830
and they'll fall down to the bottom and
 

583
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,000
and they'll fall down to the bottom and
it's very inefficient very inefficient

584
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,010
it's very inefficient very inefficient
 

585
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,310
it's very inefficient very inefficient
because then I merge the cactus together

586
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
because then I merge the cactus together
 

587
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,890
because then I merge the cactus together
at the bottom layer here all to the

588
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:50,900
at the bottom layer here all to the
 

589
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,930
at the bottom layer here all to the
center point I could have made it so the

590
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:52,940
center point I could have made it so the
 

591
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,160
center point I could have made it so the
cactus all moved to the center but I

592
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,170
cactus all moved to the center but I
 

593
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,480
cactus all moved to the center but I
didn't do it that way when I made this

594
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,490
didn't do it that way when I made this
 

595
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,770
didn't do it that way when I made this
originally so we're not doing it this

596
00:15:59,770 --> 00:15:59,780
originally so we're not doing it this
 

597
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,780
originally so we're not doing it this
time either there's a thing about like

598
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:04,790
time either there's a thing about like
 

599
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,110
time either there's a thing about like
efficiency in this game it's good to

600
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,120
efficiency in this game it's good to
 

601
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,880
efficiency in this game it's good to
make efficient firms and all that but it

602
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:09,890
make efficient firms and all that but it
 

603
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,230
make efficient firms and all that but it
does get to the point where everybody

604
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,240
does get to the point where everybody
 

605
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,660
does get to the point where everybody
makes the same exact farm and that gets

606
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:13,670
makes the same exact farm and that gets
 

607
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,310
makes the same exact farm and that gets
boring you to be honest

608
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,320
boring you to be honest
 

609
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,600
boring you to be honest
so some if inefficiency is actually good

610
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,610
so some if inefficiency is actually good
 

611
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,930
so some if inefficiency is actually good
in the creative side of this game I find

612
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:22,940
in the creative side of this game I find
 

613
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,530
in the creative side of this game I find
I don't know

614
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:25,540
I don't know
 

615
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,330
I don't know
so anyway I'm gonna lay down some more

616
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,340
so anyway I'm gonna lay down some more
 

617
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,560
so anyway I'm gonna lay down some more
brick here it looks like I'm gonna have

618
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,570
brick here it looks like I'm gonna have
 

619
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,330
brick here it looks like I'm gonna have
to get more it's taking a lot of brick

620
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,340
to get more it's taking a lot of brick
 

621
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,090
to get more it's taking a lot of brick
oops

622
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,100
oops
 

623
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,010
oops
alright guys so on the outside here

624
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,020
alright guys so on the outside here
 

625
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,760
alright guys so on the outside here
we're gonna put stairs all the way

626
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:42,770
we're gonna put stairs all the way
 

627
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,060
we're gonna put stairs all the way
around and then we need to put something

628
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,070
around and then we need to put something
 

629
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,950
around and then we need to put something
here to attach the water from falling

630
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:47,960
here to attach the water from falling
 

631
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,340
here to attach the water from falling
down

632
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,350
down
 

633
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,010
down
I used ladders before

634

not sure it's gonna work I'm gonna put a
hopper there just for now originally in

952
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,210
hopper there just for now originally in
 

953
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,010
hopper there just for now originally in
my original one this water stream

954
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,020
my original one this water stream
 

955
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,620
my original one this water stream
extended about 50 blocks and the cactus

956
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,630
extended about 50 blocks and the cactus
 

957
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,650
extended about 50 blocks and the cactus
would fall down into my storage room so

958
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:50,660
would fall down into my storage room so
 

959
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,270
would fall down into my storage room so
I thought that was pretty cool

960
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:54,280
I thought that was pretty cool
 

961
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,780
I thought that was pretty cool

that doesn't happen now and this was the

978
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,480
that doesn't happen now and this was the
 

979
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,740
that doesn't happen now and this was the
first like technical project I did like

980
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:26,750
first like technical project I did like
 

981
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,450
first like technical project I did like
I actually used a pen and paper to plant

982
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:28,460
I actually used a pen and paper to plant
 

983
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,130
I actually used a pen and paper to plant
it because I didn't know how to merge

984
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,140
it because I didn't know how to merge
 

985
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,520
it because I didn't know how to merge
water streams back then

986
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,530
water streams back then
 

987
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,290
water streams back then
so I had to figure it out so the water

988
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,300
so I had to figure it out so the water
 

989
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,960
so I had to figure it out so the water
stream would run its full length

990
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:37,970
stream would run its full length
 

991
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:45,789
stream would run its full length
like yes like these the water stream

992
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:45,799
like yes like these the water stream
 

993
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,560
like yes like these the water stream
they meet up here and then there's a new

994
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:48,570
they meet up here and then there's a new
 

995
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:55,960
they meet up here and then there's a new
water stream here oh the water glitch oh

996
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:55,970

 

997
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,410

that was weird

998
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:57,420
that was weird
 

999
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,110
that was weird
and then they merge here new water

1000
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,120
and then they merge here new water
 

1001
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,799
and then they merge here new water
stream don't we got a carrot we might

1002
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:06,809
stream don't we got a carrot we might
 

1003
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,510
stream don't we got a carrot we might
need to put more glass blocks up there I

1004
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,520
need to put more glass blocks up there I
 

1005
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,810
need to put more glass blocks up there I
think

1006
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:08,820
think
 

1007
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,180
think
cactus must be landing on the glass

1008
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,190
cactus must be landing on the glass
 

1009
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,669
cactus must be landing on the glass
blocks let's go check real quick I

1010
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
blocks let's go check real quick I
 

1011
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,490
blocks let's go check real quick I

still works it should right there's no
class or no cactus on the glass box here

1016
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,290

 

1017
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,409

let me think we did see one on the wall

1018
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:36,419
let me think we did see one on the wall
 

1019

1027
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,750
know my channel from the boat dispenser
thing that probably never would have

1028
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
thing that probably never would have
 

1029
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,340
thing that probably never would have
happened if it wasn't for this Gattis

1030
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,350
happened if it wasn't for this Gattis
 

1031
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,220
happened if it wasn't for this Gattis
farm because this is a project like I

people away if they saw it but that
never ended up happening until the boat

1048
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
never ended up happening until the boat
 

1049
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,049
never ended up happening until the boat
dispenser it's like you know what I

1050
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:21,059
dispenser it's like you know what I
 

1051
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,450
dispenser it's like you know what I
really got to do this YouTube thing

1052
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:22,460
really got to do this YouTube thing
 

1053
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,470
really got to do this YouTube thing
people would love to see this and yeah

1054

people would love to see this and yeah
so this was like the stepping stone to

1056
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:29,460
so this was like the stepping stone to
 

1057
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,150
so this was like the stepping stone to
it even though I didn't start YouTube to

show this the next big project I did I
 

1061
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,820
show this the next big project I did I
was like you know what I'm just gonna do

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:37,830
was like you know what I'm just gonna do
 

1063
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:45,200
was like you know what I'm just gonna do

1079
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,370
we're gonna get at least one out of this
it's awesome I think the majority of

1080
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,380
it's awesome I think the majority of
 

1081
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,889
it's awesome I think the majority of
them they either fall on the wall out

1082
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:20,899
them they either fall on the wall out
 

1083
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,350
them they either fall on the wall out
here which I mean it's fine I don't

1084
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
here which I mean it's fine I don't
 

1085
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,580
here which I mean it's fine I don't
really care

1086
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,590
really care
 

1087
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,190
really care
or they they land on the other cactuses

1088
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,200
or they they land on the other cactuses
 

1089
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,629
or they they land on the other cactuses
up there when they when they break

1090
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:31,639
up there when they when they break
 

1091
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,450
up there when they when they break
because they they're not level the

1092
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:34,460
because they they're not level the
 

1093
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,669
because they they're not level the
tactus is it would work much better if

1094
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:36,679
tactus is it would work much better if
 

1095
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,470
tactus is it would work much better if
they were level but since it makes like

1096
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,480
they were level but since it makes like
 

1097
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,279
they were level but since it makes like
cone shape a lot of them get destroyed

1098
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,289
cone shape a lot of them get destroyed
 

1099
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,940
cone shape a lot of them get destroyed
it's all good though

1100
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:48,950
it's all good though
 

1101
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,009
it's all good though
it's not about efficiency with this I

1102
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:51,019
it's not about efficiency with this I
 

1103
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:59,620
it's not about efficiency with this I
don't use mini cactus period so we gotta

1104
00:28:59,620 --> 00:28:59,630
don't use mini cactus period so we gotta
 

1105
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,710
don't use mini cactus period so we gotta
try something here too I think what's

1106
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
try something here too I think what's
 

1107
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,080
try something here too I think what's
missing yeah

1108
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,090
missing yeah
 

1109

this idea I'm still kinda tempted to do
it where I would somehow incorporate

1186
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:32,870
it where I would somehow incorporate
 

1187
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,710
it where I would somehow incorporate
command blocks into my let's play like

1188

command blocks into my let's play like
 

1189

systems or anything like that I think it
would be really amazing to have a

1202

would be really amazing to have a
 

1203
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,660

survival world with command blocks
 

1205
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,520

00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,530
because you could do a lot more stuff
 

1207
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,040
because you could do a lot more stuff
and do a lot of cool things a lot of the

1208

and do a lot of cool things a lot of the
 

1209
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,540
and do a lot of cool things a lot of the
times like people will make these neat

1210
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:04,550
times like people will make these neat
 

1211
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,000
times like people will make these neat
things and show them on YouTube they'll

1212
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,010
things and show them on YouTube they'll
 

1213
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,330
things and show them on YouTube they'll
do it in a creative world and they don't

1214
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:10,340
do it in a creative world and they don't
 

1215
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,060
do it in a creative world and they don't
get used ever like it they show them but

1216
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,070
get used ever like it they show them but
 

1217
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,480
get used ever like it they show them but
there's no practical value to them

1218
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,490
there's no practical value to them
 

1219
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,620
there's no practical value to them
think of how amazing it would be

1220
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:17,630
think of how amazing it would be
 

1221
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,320
think of how amazing it would be
if you could like have a command block

uh-huh but obviously a lot of people
 

1233
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,410
uh-huh but obviously a lot of people
would not go for that idea they would

1234
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:35,420
would not go for that idea they would
 

1235
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,020
would not go for that idea they would
feel it wrecks a survival aspect to it

1236
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,030
feel it wrecks a survival aspect to it
 

1237
