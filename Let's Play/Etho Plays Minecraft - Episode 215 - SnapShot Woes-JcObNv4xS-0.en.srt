00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,200
comments saying that wither skeletons
would be able to spawn in this older

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,210
would be able to spawn in this older
 

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,670
would be able to spawn in this older
fortress so I came back here ran around

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,680
fortress so I came back here ran around
 

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,320
fortress so I came back here ran around
it for a long time looking for him

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,330
it for a long time looking for him
 

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,170

didn't find any then I started tearing

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,180
didn't find any then I started tearing
 

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,450
didn't find any then I started tearing
down the walls in between the corridors

18
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,460
down the walls in between the corridors
 

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,510
down the walls in between the corridors
and increasing the spawn area also

20
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
and increasing the spawn area also
 

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,700
and increasing the spawn area also
making it easier to see if they spawn

22
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:40,710
making it easier to see if they spawn
 

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,260
making it easier to see if they spawn
and after a long long time I saw

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,270
and after a long long time I saw
 

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,869
and after a long long time I saw
hundreds of these guys spawn the zombie

00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:47,879
hundreds of these guys spawn the zombie
 

27
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,900
hundreds of these guys spawn the zombie
pigmen and I even saw some magma cubes

28
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:50,910
pigmen and I even saw some magma cubes
 

29
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,650
pigmen and I even saw some magma cubes
spawn in here but no wither skeletons

30
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:54,660
spawn in here but no wither skeletons
 

31
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,029
spawn in here but no wither skeletons
and no blazes none so I went back to the

32
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
and no blazes none so I went back to the
 

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,130
and no blazes none so I went back to the
fortress we found last time the newly

34
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,140
fortress we found last time the newly
 

35
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,119
fortress we found last time the newly
generated one in the snapshot and

36
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:04,129
generated one in the snapshot and
 

37
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,390
generated one in the snapshot and
nothing to be found there either so did

38
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
nothing to be found there either so did
 

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,609
nothing to be found there either so did
some more research a lot of people

40
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:10,619
some more research a lot of people
 

41
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,730
some more research a lot of people

basically I think he made like a mod for

48
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
basically I think he made like a mod for
 

49
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,640
basically I think he made like a mod for
the game that shows what spawns in the

50
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,650
the game that shows what spawns in the
 

51
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,620
the game that shows what spawns in the
nether depending on where he's standing

52
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,630
nether depending on where he's standing
 

53
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,760
nether depending on where he's standing
and when he newly generates a fortress

54
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:33,770
and when he newly generates a fortress
 

55
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,590
and when he newly generates a fortress
blazes and wither skeletons can spawn

56
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
blazes and wither skeletons can spawn
 

57
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,469
blazes and wither skeletons can spawn
but once he unloads it like if he leaves

58
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,479
but once he unloads it like if he leaves
 

59
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,560
but once he unloads it like if he leaves
the game and comes back it's like the

60
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
the game and comes back it's like the
 

61
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,899
the game and comes back it's like the
extra data for the fortress doesn't save

62
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:44,909
extra data for the fortress doesn't save
 

63
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,210
extra data for the fortress doesn't save
like the bounding box information and

64
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,220
like the bounding box information and
 

65
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,840
like the bounding box information and
that doesn't save so the fortress

66
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:50,850
that doesn't save so the fortress
 

67
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,960
that doesn't save so the fortress
becomes kind of dead for spawning blaze

68
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:53,970
becomes kind of dead for spawning blaze
 

69
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,749
becomes kind of dead for spawning blaze
and wither skeletons so that is a big

70
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
and wither skeletons so that is a big
 

71
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,600
and wither skeletons so that is a big
bug and until it's fixed there's not

72
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,610
bug and until it's fixed there's not
 

73
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,289
bug and until it's fixed there's not
really any good way of getting the

74
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:06,299
really any good way of getting the
 

75
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,719
really any good way of getting the
wither skulls and I would recommend you

76
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:08,729
wither skulls and I would recommend you
 

77
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,359
wither skulls and I would recommend you
don't

78
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:10,369
don't
 

79
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,580
don't
go exploring in the nether too far just

80
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:12,590
go exploring in the nether too far just
 

81
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,890
go exploring in the nether too far just
in case if when they do fix it they

82
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:14,900
in case if when they do fix it they
 

83
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,309
in case if when they do fix it they
don't fix or they don't some aren't able

84
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
don't fix or they don't some aren't able
 

85
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,809
don't fix or they don't some aren't able
to fix the fortresses you've already

00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:19,819
to fix the fortresses you've already
 

87
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,399
to fix the fortresses you've already
found they might be able to but just in

00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:24,409
found they might be able to but just in
 

89
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,960
found they might be able to but just in
case they don't you might not want to go

91
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,180
case they don't you might not want to go
too far because there's a chance I

look up here at the e the first number
 

105

look up here at the e the first number
is how many your are within view in the

number is total and that is down to
 

111
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,809
number is total and that is down to
about 41 it stays around the 40s

about 41 it stays around the 40s
 

113

about 41 it stays around the 40s
sometimes even in the 30s in the in the

is 79 it can go over that but 79 sort of
 

119

here it seems to be about half that so I
 

123
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,819

don't know when that change but mob
 

125
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,619
don't know when that change but mob
count is much lower in the nether than

it used to be oh and just to clarify I

it used to be oh and just to clarify I
 

129
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,909
it used to be oh and just to clarify I
should have said this but the the e up

there isn't just for mobs it's it's
 

133
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,520
there isn't just for mobs it's it's
total entities so mobs count as entity

134
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,530
total entities so mobs count as entity

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,430
these if I throw one of these it goes up
 

139
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,229
these if I throw one of these it goes up
by one every time but in my nether I'm

mobs are off so they're on it goes up to
 

149
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,539
mobs are off so they're on it goes up to
about 40 or so that's that's about what

150
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:58,549
about 40 or so that's that's about what

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:15,129
been sort of neglected lately and
they're not getting done this silverfish

162
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:15,139
they're not getting done this silverfish
 

163
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,170
they're not getting done this silverfish
farm it still works really really well

164
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,180
farm it still works really really well
 

165
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,860
farm it still works really really well
does exactly what I want it to my

166
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:20,870
does exactly what I want it to my
 

167
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,379
does exactly what I want it to my
problem is though I have it off most

168
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:23,389
problem is though I have it off most
 

169
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,959
problem is though I have it off most
time because it's been full keeps

170
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:25,969
time because it's been full keeps
 

171
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,779
time because it's been full keeps
filling up and I have no real proper way

172
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:28,789
filling up and I have no real proper way
 

173
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,300
filling up and I have no real proper way
of dealing with the guys yet which I

174
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,310
of dealing with the guys yet which I
 

175
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,619
of dealing with the guys yet which I
really should because I've had this

176
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:32,629
really should because I've had this
 

177
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,149
really should because I've had this
thing built for so long like we've tried

178
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:37,159
thing built for so long like we've tried
 

179
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,010
thing built for so long like we've tried
we've tried things we've built the

180
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,020
we've tried things we've built the
 

181
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,649
we've tried things we've built the
ternal over here to get them to the

182
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:41,659
ternal over here to get them to the
 

183
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,480
ternal over here to get them to the
surface and then we can move them where

184
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,490
surface and then we can move them where
 

185
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,070
surface and then we can move them where
we want but as you've seen there's

186
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
we want but as you've seen there's
 

187
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,529
we want but as you've seen there's
problems with that they attack me like

188
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:50,539
problems with that they attack me like
 

189
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,200
problems with that they attack me like
crazy and on the way I lose them

190
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,210
crazy and on the way I lose them
 

191
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,779
crazy and on the way I lose them
whenever I have to cross water or they

192
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:55,789
whenever I have to cross water or they
 

193
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:01,149
whenever I have to cross water or they
run into cactus or if I go uphill and

194
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:01,159
run into cactus or if I go uphill and
 

195
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,760
run into cactus or if I go uphill and
stuff is when I lose a lot of guys so

196
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,770
stuff is when I lose a lot of guys so
 

197
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,249
stuff is when I lose a lot of guys so
I've concluded that moving them on the

198
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:06,259
I've concluded that moving them on the
 

199
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,589
I've concluded that moving them on the
surface is not going to work the longer

200
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:08,599
surface is not going to work the longer
 

201
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,749
surface is not going to work the longer
or the further I move them on the

202
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:10,759
or the further I move them on the
 

203
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,760
or the further I move them on the
surface some more I lose and by the time

204
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:12,770
surface some more I lose and by the time
 

205
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,309
surface some more I lose and by the time
I get to my destination they're usually

206
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:15,319
I get to my destination they're usually
 

207
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,850
I get to my destination they're usually
all gone so my new plan is to set up

208
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:18,860
all gone so my new plan is to set up
 

209
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,839
all gone so my new plan is to set up
tunnels wherever I want to take them

210
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:21,849
tunnels wherever I want to take them
 

211
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:25,860
tunnels wherever I want to take them
underground on flat land like this and

212
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,870
underground on flat land like this and
 

213
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,399
underground on flat land like this and
I'm digging this at y12 so on the way I

214
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,409
I'm digging this at y12 so on the way I
 

215
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,329
I'm digging this at y12 so on the way I
get lots of redstone and other goodies

216
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:33,339
get lots of redstone and other goodies
 

217
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,459
get lots of redstone and other goodies
I've started lining this with soil at

218
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:36,469
I've started lining this with soil at
 

219
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:41,200
I've started lining this with soil at
the bottom I just because it's it's a

220
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,210
the bottom I just because it's it's a
 

221
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,930
the bottom I just because it's it's a
cheap resource and it doesn't burn

222
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:43,940
cheap resource and it doesn't burn
 

223
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,719
cheap resource and it doesn't burn
because I'm passing really close to lava

224
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:46,729
because I'm passing really close to lava
 

225
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,510
because I'm passing really close to lava
so I can't really use wood or leaves or

226
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
so I can't really use wood or leaves or
 

227
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,740
so I can't really use wood or leaves or
anything so I may um ooh kind of lost my

228
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,750
anything so I may um ooh kind of lost my
 

229
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,980
anything so I may um ooh kind of lost my
voice there I may do the whole tunnel

230
00:05:59,980 --> 00:05:59,990
voice there I may do the whole tunnel
 

231
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,519
voice there I may do the whole tunnel
soil all around or at the very least I

232
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:03,529
soil all around or at the very least I
 

233
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,540
soil all around or at the very least I
need to go up to here because if they

234
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,550
need to go up to here because if they
 

235
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,100
need to go up to here because if they
jump they can get into these blocks

236
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,110
jump they can get into these blocks
 

237
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,980
jump they can get into these blocks
still and I don't want them chewing up

238
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:11,990
still and I don't want them chewing up
 

239
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,230
still and I don't want them chewing up
my tunnel after I've built it

240
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
my tunnel after I've built it
 

241
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,540
my tunnel after I've built it
ooh this is a belt where I left off so

242
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:19,550
ooh this is a belt where I left off so
 

243
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,210
ooh this is a belt where I left off so
I'm taking them to that desert

244
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,220

 

245
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,740

which is quite ways so I'm going to keep

246
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:27,750
which is quite ways so I'm going to keep
 

247
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,830
which is quite ways so I'm going to keep
working at this and I may plant grass in

248
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:30,840
working at this and I may plant grass in
 

249
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,560
working at this and I may plant grass in
the soil to make it look better if I had

250
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,570
the soil to make it look better if I had
 

251
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,030
the soil to make it look better if I had
mycelium I would probably use that

252
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,040
mycelium I would probably use that
 

253
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,340
mycelium I would probably use that
instead but I don't still haven't found

254
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,350
instead but I don't still haven't found
 

255
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,020
instead but I don't still haven't found
a mushroom biome actually you know what

256
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,030
a mushroom biome actually you know what
 

257
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,880
a mushroom biome actually you know what
it just occurred to me what I should

258
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:43,890
it just occurred to me what I should
 

259
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,310
it just occurred to me what I should
really be using is these or some other

260
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,320
really be using is these or some other
 

261
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,650
really be using is these or some other
type of slab because I don't want slime

262
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:51,660
type of slab because I don't want slime
 

263
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,720
type of slab because I don't want slime
spawning in that tunnel I'll lower my

264
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:53,730
spawning in that tunnel I'll lower my
 

265
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,980
spawning in that tunnel I'll lower my
mob rates if I if they are and I really

266
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:57,990
mob rates if I if they are and I really
 

267
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,060
mob rates if I if they are and I really
won't be able to control that unless I

268
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,070
won't be able to control that unless I
 

269
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,290
won't be able to control that unless I
use these ah too little too late now I

270
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,300
use these ah too little too late now I
 

271
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,390
use these ah too little too late now I
gotta rip this all out but yeah and the

272
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
gotta rip this all out but yeah and the
 

273
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,740
gotta rip this all out but yeah and the
nice thing is there they're bright

274
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,750
nice thing is there they're bright
 

275
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:20,000
nice thing is there they're bright
they're white yeah that'll be much

276
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,010
they're white yeah that'll be much
 

277
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,090
they're white yeah that'll be much
better in fact I just I also thought of

278
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,100
better in fact I just I also thought of
 

279
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,080
better in fact I just I also thought of
this I might want to do something like

280
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,090
this I might want to do something like
 

281
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:34,550
this I might want to do something like
this to where I have stairs here for the

282
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
this to where I have stairs here for the
 

283
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:43,159
this to where I have stairs here for the
walls I do this and then that even

284
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,169
walls I do this and then that even
 

285
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,450
walls I do this and then that even
though it might not look the greatest

286
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
though it might not look the greatest
 

287
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,690
though it might not look the greatest
that will sort of widen this by an extra

288
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:47,700
that will sort of widen this by an extra
 

289
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,490
that will sort of widen this by an extra
block without having to do any more work

290
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,500
block without having to do any more work
 

291
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,400
block without having to do any more work
because I get half a block on this side

292
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,410
because I get half a block on this side
 

293
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,170
because I get half a block on this side
half a block on that side so bad yet is

294
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,180
half a block on that side so bad yet is
 

295
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,700
half a block on that side so bad yet is
bad and get the lighting glitch mmm it

296
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:01,710
bad and get the lighting glitch mmm it
 

297
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,989
bad and get the lighting glitch mmm it
might be worth it though

298
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:06,999

 

299
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,350

yeah I think that's what I'm going to do

300
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
yeah I think that's what I'm going to do
 

301
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,819
yeah I think that's what I'm going to do
um how can I fix that again I'd have to

302
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:14,829
um how can I fix that again I'd have to
 

303
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,589
um how can I fix that again I'd have to
dig a lot more to fix that

304
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:16,599
dig a lot more to fix that
 

305
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,669
dig a lot more to fix that
yeah mm I think I'm going to keep the

306
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:23,679
yeah mm I think I'm going to keep the
 

307
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:29,369
yeah mm I think I'm going to keep the
lighting glitch in I finished taps

308
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:29,379
lighting glitch in I finished taps
 

309
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,100
lighting glitch in I finished taps
lapping up this tunnel and as uh as

310
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,110
lapping up this tunnel and as uh as
 

311
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,740
lapping up this tunnel and as uh as
getting rid the torches and it was all

312
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:34,750
getting rid the torches and it was all
 

313
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,749
getting rid the torches and it was all
dark in here and I thought hey you know

314
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:36,759
dark in here and I thought hey you know
 

315
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,360
dark in here and I thought hey you know
what maybe I should try something like

316
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,370
what maybe I should try something like
 

317
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,480
what maybe I should try something like
this have lighting go through the stairs

318
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,490
this have lighting go through the stairs
 

319
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,660
this have lighting go through the stairs
and just get the visual lighting the

320
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:45,670
and just get the visual lighting the
 

321
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,129
and just get the visual lighting the
ambience GD lighting like this that

322
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:50,139
ambience GD lighting like this that
 

323
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,699
ambience GD lighting like this that
could be pretty cool but maybe like I

324
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:53,709
could be pretty cool but maybe like I
 

325
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,319
could be pretty cool but maybe like I
tried to check our pattern here maybe we

326
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:55,329
tried to check our pattern here maybe we
 

327
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,110
tried to check our pattern here maybe we
should do something different though

328
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
should do something different though
 

329
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
should do something different though
like maybe just make it solid that would

330
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:00,730
like maybe just make it solid that would
 

331
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:09,829
like maybe just make it solid that would
be easier actually to kind of like that

332
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
be easier actually to kind of like that
 

333
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,519
be easier actually to kind of like that
maybe change that to see what it looks

334
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:14,529
maybe change that to see what it looks
 

335
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,740
maybe change that to see what it looks
like if the stairs are all all lit up

336
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:18,750
like if the stairs are all all lit up
 

337
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,420
like if the stairs are all all lit up
but this is really cheap for me because

338
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,430
but this is really cheap for me because
 

339
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,340
but this is really cheap for me because
I got lots of cobble and I don't mind

340
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,350
I got lots of cobble and I don't mind
 

341
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,400
I got lots of cobble and I don't mind
using it while dirt is a little bit more

342
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,410
using it while dirt is a little bit more
 

343
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,129
using it while dirt is a little bit more
rare for me and obviously I don't want

344
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:29,139
rare for me and obviously I don't want
 

345
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,689
rare for me and obviously I don't want
to use things like sand stone or

346
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:30,699
to use things like sand stone or
 

347
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,850
to use things like sand stone or
anything like that because this is a

348
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:32,860
anything like that because this is a
 

349
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,749
anything like that because this is a
pretty grunt project and even this is

350
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:35,759
pretty grunt project and even this is
 

351
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,650
pretty grunt project and even this is
probably more time than I should be

352
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:37,660
probably more time than I should be
 

353
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,100
probably more time than I should be
spending on it but yeah that could be

354
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,110
spending on it but yeah that could be
 

355
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,499
spending on it but yeah that could be
cool have that on both sides and maybe

356
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:43,509
cool have that on both sides and maybe
 

357
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,889
cool have that on both sides and maybe
some lighting in the top to the top

358
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:46,899
some lighting in the top to the top
 

359
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,090
some lighting in the top to the top
corners this is pretty wild too if I do

360
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,100
corners this is pretty wild too if I do
 

361
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,179
corners this is pretty wild too if I do
it like this whoo that's cool

362
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:57,189
it like this whoo that's cool
 

363
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,100
it like this whoo that's cool
quite a bit of extra work though and I

364
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,110
quite a bit of extra work though and I
 

365
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,610
quite a bit of extra work though and I
think to do it properly would make it

366
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:02,620
think to do it properly would make it
 

367
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,129
think to do it properly would make it
even more work if I can't just do it

368
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:05,139
even more work if I can't just do it
 

369
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:05,639
even more work if I can't just do it
like this

370
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:05,649
like this
 

371
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,590
like this
if I do it like this I think we'll get

372
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
if I do it like this I think we'll get
 

373
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,679
if I do it like this I think we'll get
slime spawning in here so to do it

374
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:10,689
slime spawning in here so to do it
 

375
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,480
slime spawning in here so to do it
properly I would either have to put

376
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,490
properly I would either have to put
 

377
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,730
properly I would either have to put
torches underneath like that and then

378
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:17,740
torches underneath like that and then
 

379
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,850
torches underneath like that and then
like half slabs

380
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:20,860

 

381
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,119

over here prevent the slimes from

382
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:24,129
over here prevent the slimes from
 

383
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,970
over here prevent the slimes from
spawning and then I could have torches

384
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:26,980
spawning and then I could have torches
 

385
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,639
spawning and then I could have torches
up higher oh no it doesn't work if the

386
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:32,649
up higher oh no it doesn't work if the
 

387
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,189
up higher oh no it doesn't work if the
torches underneath so I think the only

388
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:35,199
torches underneath so I think the only
 

389
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,920
torches underneath so I think the only
way to properly do it is either to have

390
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,930
way to properly do it is either to have
 

391
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,470
way to properly do it is either to have
torches all the way along I think that

392
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
torches all the way along I think that
 

393
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,160
torches all the way along I think that
will prevent slimes from spawning or

394
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,170
will prevent slimes from spawning or
 

395
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,559
will prevent slimes from spawning or
have lava at the bottom of this which

396
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:49,569
have lava at the bottom of this which
 

397
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:55,799
have lava at the bottom of this which
would be a bit of work hmm is pretty

398
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:55,809
would be a bit of work hmm is pretty
 

399
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,069
would be a bit of work hmm is pretty
cool I think what I'll do first is just

400
00:10:59,069 --> 00:10:59,079
cool I think what I'll do first is just
 

401
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,889
cool I think what I'll do first is just
get it up and working with the lighting

402
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:01,899
get it up and working with the lighting
 

403
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,439
get it up and working with the lighting
glitch and then if people like liked it

404
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:04,449
glitch and then if people like liked it
 

405
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:08,129
glitch and then if people like liked it
like this I'll go through here spend a

406
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:08,139
like this I'll go through here spend a
 

407
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,840
like this I'll go through here spend a
little more time and just make it nice

408
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:09,850
little more time and just make it nice
 

409
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,079
little more time and just make it nice
like this - check it out man I found a

410
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:13,089
like this - check it out man I found a
 

411
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,030
like this - check it out man I found a
zombie with a shovel there's one with

412
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
zombie with a shovel there's one with

now I just realized really late into
 

459
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,650
now I just realized really late into
this that I should just be using nether

460
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:58,660
this that I should just be using nether
 

461
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,650
this that I should just be using nether
portals to move them ah dang it why did

crazy stuff that was awesome um guys
should really just be using nether

476
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:36,820
should really just be using nether
 

477
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,250
should really just be using nether
portals and then I can move them up and

478
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,260
portals and then I can move them up and
 

479
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:50,460
portals and then I can move them up and
down vertically really easy - so after

480
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,470
down vertically really easy - so after
 

481
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,320
down vertically really easy - so after
after we finish cool I'm just going to

482
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,330
after we finish cool I'm just going to
 

483
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,430
after we finish cool I'm just going to
finish pulling the cell since it's

484
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
finish pulling the cell since it's
 

485
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,050
finish pulling the cell since it's
already anyway

486
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,060
already anyway
 

487
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,020
already anyway
but after after I do this I'm going to

488
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,030
but after after I do this I'm going to
 

489
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,480
but after after I do this I'm going to
try set up another portal for them

490
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,490
try set up another portal for them
 

491
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,240
try set up another portal for them
and just see what happens when I tried

492
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,250
and just see what happens when I tried
 

493
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,190
and just see what happens when I tried
to get them through it so I will be

494
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:11,200
to get them through it so I will be
 

495
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,590
to get them through it so I will be
right back alright so we're just going

496
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:16,600
right back alright so we're just going
 

497
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,480
right back alright so we're just going
to do a rough test to this instead of

498
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,490
to do a rough test to this instead of
 

499
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,820
to do a rough test to this instead of
having the tunnel here we're going to

500
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:20,830
having the tunnel here we're going to
 

501
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,530
having the tunnel here we're going to
have them go straight into a portal

502
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:24,540
have them go straight into a portal
 

503
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,510
have them go straight into a portal
which we can't rip that which we can

504
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:27,520
which we can't rip that which we can
 

505
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,930
which we can't rip that which we can
control with this lever so that's open

506
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:30,940
control with this lever so that's open
 

507
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,750
control with this lever so that's open
they'll go right through here then we'll

508
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
they'll go right through here then we'll
 

509
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,580
they'll go right through here then we'll
put blocks behind it so they can't get

510
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:35,590
put blocks behind it so they can't get
 

511
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,960
put blocks behind it so they can't get
through I'm not sure if they can or not

512
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:38,970
through I'm not sure if they can or not
 

513
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,220
through I'm not sure if they can or not
if we go through I just want to see

514
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,230
if we go through I just want to see
 

515
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,150
if we go through I just want to see
where it'll take us it takes us to this

516
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,160
where it'll take us it takes us to this
 

517
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,250
where it'll take us it takes us to this
one so I'm going to make a second portal

518
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:47,260
one so I'm going to make a second portal
 

519
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,160
one so I'm going to make a second portal
in here and see if we can separate them

520
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,170
in here and see if we can separate them
 

521
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,050
in here and see if we can separate them
let's go figure out the coordinates and

522
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,060
let's go figure out the coordinates and
 

523
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,850
let's go figure out the coordinates and
stuff whoa

524
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:56,860

 

525
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,350

okay we're here well I tried making a

526
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
okay we're here well I tried making a
 

527
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,420
okay we're here well I tried making a
portal in the ceiling but I forgot that

528
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:03,430
portal in the ceiling but I forgot that
 

529
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,330
portal in the ceiling but I forgot that
won't work because I always get sent to

530
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:06,340
won't work because I always get sent to
 

531
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,390
won't work because I always get sent to
this one it's closer then then that one

532
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,400
this one it's closer then then that one
 

533
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,610
this one it's closer then then that one
because it's way up high so my second

534
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:14,620
because it's way up high so my second
 

535
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,580
because it's way up high so my second
portal or my silverfish portal is going

536
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,590
portal or my silverfish portal is going
 

537
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,030
portal or my silverfish portal is going
to go here right here I've got to figure

538
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
to go here right here I've got to figure
 

539
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,580
to go here right here I've got to figure
it out and I might have to use this as

540
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,590
it out and I might have to use this as
 

541
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,130
it out and I might have to use this as
my main portal for a while also or

542
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,140
my main portal for a while also or
 

543
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,910
my main portal for a while also or
forever perhaps even because it's tough

544
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
forever perhaps even because it's tough
 

545
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,660
forever perhaps even because it's tough
to have two portals together like this

546
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:32,670
to have two portals together like this
 

547
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,190
to have two portals together like this
if I go through here I'll probably get

548
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,200
if I go through here I'll probably get
 

549
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,190
if I go through here I'll probably get
sent back through the other one there

550
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,200
sent back through the other one there
 

551
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,810
sent back through the other one there
anyhow okay took us out here like we

552
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:42,820
anyhow okay took us out here like we
 

553
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,020
anyhow okay took us out here like we
want if we go through this so where is

554
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,030
want if we go through this so where is
 

555
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,560
want if we go through this so where is
it going to take us okay it sent us here

556
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,570
it going to take us okay it sent us here
 

557
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,770
it going to take us okay it sent us here
now let's try goes through the other

558
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:52,780
now let's try goes through the other
 

559
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,260
now let's try goes through the other
portal we have in the stronghold it's

560
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,270
portal we have in the stronghold it's
 

561
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,040
portal we have in the stronghold it's
about eight blocks way in the nether

562
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,050

 

563
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,650

portal stuff confuses me sometimes such

564
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:07,660
portal stuff confuses me sometimes such
 

565
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,140
portal stuff confuses me sometimes such
a nightmare working it out okay so if we

566
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,150
a nightmare working it out okay so if we
 

567
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,140
a nightmare working it out okay so if we
go through the portal up here let's just

568
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,150
go through the portal up here let's just
 

569
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:22,910
go through the portal up here let's just
see where this is going to take us

570
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:22,920

 

571
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,220

I built a new second portal down at Y 65

572
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,230
I built a new second portal down at Y 65
 

573
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,379
I built a new second portal down at Y 65
yeah it took us here that's okay

574
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:30,389
yeah it took us here that's okay
 

575
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,099

what I'm going to do now for the
 

579
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,689
what I'm going to do now for the
silverfish I'm going to have a one block

580
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:38,699
silverfish I'm going to have a one block
 

581
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,609
silverfish I'm going to have a one block
drop like this like a little catch or

582
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:43,619
drop like this like a little catch or
 

583
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:57,199
drop like this like a little catch or
cage for them see how that works out I'm

584
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,209
cage for them see how that works out I'm
 

585
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,639
cage for them see how that works out I'm
gonna get a ladder in here for me though

586
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:58,649
gonna get a ladder in here for me though
 

587
00:16:58,649 --> 00:16:59,840
gonna get a ladder in here for me though
or something

588
00:16:59,840 --> 00:16:59,850
or something
 

589
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,519
or something
I'll actually I'll just use ender pearls

590
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:01,529
I'll actually I'll just use ender pearls
 

591
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:08,720
I'll actually I'll just use ender pearls
for the test okay so how how's this

592
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:08,730
for the test okay so how how's this
 

593
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,409
for the test okay so how how's this
going to work

594
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:09,419
going to work
 

595
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,509
going to work

eh that's probably enough snowmen are

608
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,130
eh that's probably enough snowmen are
 

609
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,580
eh that's probably enough snowmen are
gonna make them keep spawning though

610
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,590

 

611
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,690

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,370
46 and then there they go so the next
thing I got to figure out is how to get

694
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:01,380
thing I got to figure out is how to get
 

695
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,910
thing I got to figure out is how to get
them from the nether to the overworld

them from the nether to the overworld
 

697

00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,420
below so I don't know what the deal is
 

721
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,610
below so I don't know what the deal is
with my survival world or my LP world I

722
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:01,620
with my survival world or my LP world I
 

723
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,310
with my survival world or my LP world I
should say if this one works

724
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
should say if this one works
 

725
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,000
should say if this one works
mine should work too yeah this is weird

726
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,010

stuff I heard a bunch of silverfish and

728
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,100
stuff I heard a bunch of silverfish and
 

729
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,630
stuff I heard a bunch of silverfish and
I found them trapped in this block like

730
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:17,640
I found them trapped in this block like
 

731
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,440
I found them trapped in this block like
in where the redstone is there how they

732
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,450
in where the redstone is there how they
 

733
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,919
in where the redstone is there how they
got into that I have no idea I think

734
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:27,929
got into that I have no idea I think
 

735
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,710
got into that I have no idea I think
maybe what it is as I have to make the

736
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
maybe what it is as I have to make the
 

737
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,660
maybe what it is as I have to make the
opening to the portal too wide instead

738
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,670
opening to the portal too wide instead
 

739
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:40,040
opening to the portal too wide instead
of one wide that could be it and we move

740
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,050
of one wide that could be it and we move
 

741
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,510
of one wide that could be it and we move
on to round 2 so I'm just gonna try this

742
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,520
on to round 2 so I'm just gonna try this
 

743
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,620
on to round 2 so I'm just gonna try this
a few more times

744
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:45,630
a few more times
 

745
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,340
a few more times
Oh get out of here boy

746
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,350

 

747
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,740

just a few more guys this time I've made

748
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:56,750
just a few more guys this time I've made
 

749
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,230
just a few more guys this time I've made
it too wide and if this works we'll

750
00:22:59,230 --> 00:22:59,240
it too wide and if this works we'll
 

751
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,780
it too wide and if this works we'll
we'll fix it up nicer yeah that might be

752
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,790
we'll fix it up nicer yeah that might be
 

753
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,560
we'll fix it up nicer yeah that might be
the problem

754
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,570
the problem
 

755
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,700

thought the problem was is I had blocks
on the other side of the portal I

788
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:30,830
on the other side of the portal I
 

789
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,160
on the other side of the portal I
removed those and it still doesn't work

790
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,170
removed those and it still doesn't work
