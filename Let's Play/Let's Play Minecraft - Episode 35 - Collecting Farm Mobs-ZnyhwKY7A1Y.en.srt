00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
the second level so I'm just going to
 

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,059
the second level so I'm just going to
make it 10 high and hope it's good

144
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:55,069
make it 10 high and hope it's good

enough this mob sorter probably won't
need to be any higher than this so this

148
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,449
need to be any higher than this so this
 

149
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,180
need to be any higher than this so this
is level 3 and I know you guys are

150

is level 3 and I know you guys are
 

151
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,240

probably thinking on [ __ ] for
 

153
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,469
probably thinking on [ __ ] for
starting level 3 before finishing level

154
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479

1 or 2 um I may be but there is some
 

157
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,330
1 or 2 um I may be but there is some
reasoning behind it namely I want so I'm

158
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,340
reasoning behind it namely I want so I'm

164
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
them and so I want their loot to fall on
 

165
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,260
them and so I want their loot to fall on
our five-minute timer on level 1 and to

166
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,270
our five-minute timer on level 1 and to
 

167
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,450
our five-minute timer on level 1 and to
do that I need to set up the piping and

168
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,460
do that I need to set up the piping and
 

169
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,360
do that I need to set up the piping and
I can't let anything get in the way of

170
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,370
I can't let anything get in the way of
 

171
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,490
I can't let anything get in the way of
the piping like

172
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:00,500

 

173
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,160

oh not very good at explaining things I

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,170
oh not very good at explaining things I
 

175
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:11,410
oh not very good at explaining things I
need the area above the the five-minute

176
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:11,420
need the area above the the five-minute
 

177
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,120
need the area above the the five-minute
timer clear so if I was to build level

178
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,130
timer clear so if I was to build level
 

179
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,940
timer clear so if I was to build level
two first and build the a mob sorter in

180
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:18,950
two first and build the a mob sorter in
 

181
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,890
two first and build the a mob sorter in
a record studio and all that crap

182
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:22,900
a record studio and all that crap
 

183
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,180
a record studio and all that crap
there's a good chance I'm going to build

184
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,190
there's a good chance I'm going to build
 

185
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,080
there's a good chance I'm going to build
in the way of where I need to run the

186
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,090
in the way of where I need to run the
 

187
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,360
in the way of where I need to run the
piping for the loot so there is some

188
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,370
piping for the loot so there is some
 

189
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,420
piping for the loot so there is some
reasoning behind starting this level

190
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,430
reasoning behind starting this level
 

191
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:44,080
reasoning behind starting this level
before I'm done the other ones but guess

192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,090
before I'm done the other ones but guess
 

193
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,060
before I'm done the other ones but guess
what this isn't the level we're going to

194
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,070
what this isn't the level we're going to
 

195
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:54,250
what this isn't the level we're going to
be working on why not well this is the

196
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,260
be working on why not well this is the
 

197
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,070
be working on why not well this is the
mob

198
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
mob
 

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,590
mob
this is level four killing the mobs and

200
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
this is level four killing the mobs and
 

201
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,170
this is level four killing the mobs and
stuff like that the actual level for

202
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,180
stuff like that the actual level for
 

203
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,000
stuff like that the actual level for
spotting them is going to be even higher

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,010
spotting them is going to be even higher
 

205
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,390
spotting them is going to be even higher

what are we at 92 um let's see here how

208
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,290
what are we at 92 um let's see here how
 

209
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:45,860
what are we at 92 um let's see here how
do I get down ah dang it

210
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:45,870

 

211
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,379

all right

212
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:48,389
all right
 

213
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:58,530
all right
this is level 3 3 4 5 7 8 I can't

214
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:58,540
this is level 3 3 4 5 7 8 I can't
 

215
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,480
this is level 3 3 4 5 7 8 I can't
remember what the number was was it 63

216
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,490
remember what the number was was it 63
 

217
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,629
remember what the number was was it 63
down here the positioning is actually

218
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:03,639
down here the positioning is actually
 

219
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,030
down here the positioning is actually
pretty important 65 jazz we need the

220
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
pretty important 65 jazz we need the
 

221
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,519
pretty important 65 jazz we need the
spawning grounds to be out of the 24

222
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:11,529
spawning grounds to be out of the 24
 

223
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,300
spawning grounds to be out of the 24
block radius so it needs to be at least

224
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,310
block radius so it needs to be at least
 

225
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,819
block radius so it needs to be at least
24 blocks higher than ground level there

226
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:19,829
24 blocks higher than ground level there
 

227
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,840
24 blocks higher than ground level there
and yet we want it within the 32 block

228
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:24,850
and yet we want it within the 32 block
 

229
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:34,949
and yet we want it within the 32 block
radius a level 3 so and yet we need

230
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
radius a level 3 so and yet we need
 

231
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,889
radius a level 3 so and yet we need
enough space in case we set up anything

232
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:37,899
enough space in case we set up anything
 

233
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,680
enough space in case we set up anything
it takes a lot of space but I'm guessing

234
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,690
it takes a lot of space but I'm guessing
 

235
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,100
it takes a lot of space but I'm guessing
this will probably be good enough so

236
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,110
this will probably be good enough so
 

237
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,759
this will probably be good enough so
we're going to start the ceiling

238
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:46,769
we're going to start the ceiling
 

239
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,350
we're going to start the ceiling
no more levels after this one this is

240
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
no more levels after this one this is
 

241
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,090
no more levels after this one this is
the end and I'm going to lay the

242
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,100
the end and I'm going to lay the
 

243
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,040
the end and I'm going to lay the
foundation for the ceiling now voiceover

244
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,050
foundation for the ceiling now voiceover
 

245
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,000
foundation for the ceiling now voiceover
commentary alright guys so building this

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,010
commentary alright guys so building this
 

247
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,500
commentary alright guys so building this
farm animal mob collection system seemed

248
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,510
farm animal mob collection system seemed
 

249
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,480
farm animal mob collection system seemed
like a pretty simple idea in my head but

250
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,490
like a pretty simple idea in my head but
 

251
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,540
like a pretty simple idea in my head but
in reality it's actually pretty crazy

252
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,550
in reality it's actually pretty crazy
 

253
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,410
in reality it's actually pretty crazy
and insane to do so the whole thing took

254
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,420
and insane to do so the whole thing took
 

255
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,809
and insane to do so the whole thing took
me roughly four hours so I'm just going

256
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:21,819
me roughly four hours so I'm just going
 

257
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,050
me roughly four hours so I'm just going
to show you different steps I took and

258
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,060
to show you different steps I took and
 

259
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,470
to show you different steps I took and
building it first thing I'm doing here

260
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
building it first thing I'm doing here
 

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,660
building it first thing I'm doing here
is laying a 30 by 30 cobblestone base

262
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:32,670
is laying a 30 by 30 cobblestone base
 

263
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,119
is laying a 30 by 30 cobblestone base
one layer thick

264
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,129

 

265
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,730

so that I think builds for spawning pads

266
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:40,740
so that I think builds for spawning pads
 

267
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,179
so that I think builds for spawning pads
on it next thing I'm doing here is I am

268
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:47,189
on it next thing I'm doing here is I am
 

269
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,240
on it next thing I'm doing here is I am
finding my coordinates for the very

270
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,250
finding my coordinates for the very
 

271
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,410
finding my coordinates for the very
center of my storage room the x and z

272
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,420
center of my storage room the x and z
 

273
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,670
center of my storage room the x and z
coordinates the very center and then up

274
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:58,680
coordinates the very center and then up
 

275
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,369
coordinates the very center and then up
I go up and I mark them using these

276
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:01,379
I go up and I mark them using these
 

277
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,530
I go up and I mark them using these
wooden planks the very center of the

278
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:03,540
wooden planks the very center of the
 

279
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,090
wooden planks the very center of the
storage room the 2x2 area and then I

280
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,100
storage room the 2x2 area and then I
 

281
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,759
storage room the 2x2 area and then I
build all around that Center and then I

282
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:16,769
build all around that Center and then I
 

283
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,679
build all around that Center and then I
start building the actual spawning pads

284
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:18,689
start building the actual spawning pads
 

285
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:25,519
start building the actual spawning pads
out of soil similar to my mod system

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:25,529
out of soil similar to my mod system
 

287
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:31,340
out of soil similar to my mod system
they are 14 by 14 I might make some

288
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,350
they are 14 by 14 I might make some
 

289
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,809
they are 14 by 14 I might make some
adjustments to them later but that's

290
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:32,819
adjustments to them later but that's
 

291
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:45,470
adjustments to them later but that's
what I'm doing for right now you got to

292
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
what I'm doing for right now you got to
 

293
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,790
what I'm doing for right now you got to
be kind of careful when you're doing

294
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
be kind of careful when you're doing
 

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,499
be kind of careful when you're doing
this kind of thing that you light up the

296
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:48,509
this kind of thing that you light up the
 

297
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,660
this kind of thing that you light up the
area around you otherwise you might get

298
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:50,670
area around you otherwise you might get
 

299
00:12:50,670 --> 00:13:08,269
area around you otherwise you might get
some surprises yeah not my proudest

300
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:08,279
some surprises yeah not my proudest
 

301
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:33,980
some surprises yeah not my proudest
moment ever and it gets worse

302
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:33,990

 

303
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:54,470

never take your eyes off a creeper that

304
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480

 

305
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,100

was embarrassing

306
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,110
was embarrassing
 

307
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,290
was embarrassing
I was like trying to do this like jump

308
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,300
I was like trying to do this like jump
 

309
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,769
I was like trying to do this like jump
onto his head sword attack move in it I

310
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:01,779
onto his head sword attack move in it I
 

311
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,749
onto his head sword attack move in it I
missed and that's the whole thing pretty

312
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:06,759
missed and that's the whole thing pretty
 

313
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,530
missed and that's the whole thing pretty
much all done so what I do here is I am

314
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:10,540
much all done so what I do here is I am
 

315
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,869
much all done so what I do here is I am
running a spiral staircase to bring my

316
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:12,879
running a spiral staircase to bring my
 

317
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,420
running a spiral staircase to bring my
brass up to the top you should do this

318
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,430
brass up to the top you should do this
 

319
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,720
brass up to the top you should do this
early because it takes grass extremely

320
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:21,730
early because it takes grass extremely
 

321
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,809
early because it takes grass extremely
long to make it to travel that distance

322
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:24,819
