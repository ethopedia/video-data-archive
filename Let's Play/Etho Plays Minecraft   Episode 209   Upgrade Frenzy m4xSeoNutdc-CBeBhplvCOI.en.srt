23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,670
so yeah what i'm doing here i'm just
trying to make a huge delay

24
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
trying to make a huge delay
 

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,069
trying to make a huge delay
for this portal gizmo we hooked up last

26
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
for this portal gizmo we hooked up last
 

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,270
for this portal gizmo we hooked up last
time just testing something

28
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
time just testing something
 

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,189
time just testing something
and i'm not going to go any longer delay

30
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
and i'm not going to go any longer delay
 

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,950
and i'm not going to go any longer delay
on this if it doesn't work this time

32
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
on this if it doesn't work this time
 

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,070
on this if it doesn't work this time
i'm just going to do

34
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
i'm just going to do
 

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,870
i'm just going to do
do the simple way but what it's supposed

36
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
do the simple way but what it's supposed
 

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,510
do the simple way but what it's supposed
to do

38
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
to do
 

39
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,710
to do
hit this lights the portal

40
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
hit this lights the portal
 

41
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,149
hit this lights the portal
now it's going through the delay the

42
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
now it's going through the delay the
 

43
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,910
now it's going through the delay the
huge delay

44
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
huge delay
 

45
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,510
huge delay
and after a certain amount of time

46
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
and after a certain amount of time
 

47
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,030
and after a certain amount of time
it should disable itself

48
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040

 

49
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,109

that's a really long time wow

50
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119

 

51
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,230

so i thought if i do this and i go into

52
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
so i thought if i do this and i go into
 

53
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,670
so i thought if i do this and i go into
the portal quickly

54
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680

 

55
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,990

like like i definitely went in before

56
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
like like i definitely went in before
 

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,429
like like i definitely went in before
that time was up

58
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
that time was up
 

59
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,510
that time was up
i thought i'd be able to return and then

60
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
i thought i'd be able to return and then
 

61
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,670
i thought i'd be able to return and then
when i return the portal would go out

62
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
when i return the portal would go out
 

63
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,429
when i return the portal would go out
but it's it's like uh the redstone still

64
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
but it's it's like uh the redstone still
 

65
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,990
but it's it's like uh the redstone still
works even after i'm in the nether here

66
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
works even after i'm in the nether here
 

67
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,109
works even after i'm in the nether here
yeah see it disabled the portal

68
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
yeah see it disabled the portal
 

69
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,230
yeah see it disabled the portal
sent me out here

70
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
sent me out here
 

71
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,230
sent me out here
so i'm not sure if there is any way of

72
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
so i'm not sure if there is any way of
 

73
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,910
so i'm not sure if there is any way of
doing that actually

74
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
doing that actually
 

75
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,990
doing that actually
uh doesn't seem like you can do it with

76
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
uh doesn't seem like you can do it with
 

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,670
uh doesn't seem like you can do it with
redstone for sure though because

78
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
redstone for sure though because
 

79
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,389
redstone for sure though because
that was a long delay and it still

80
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
that was a long delay and it still
 

81
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,310
that was a long delay and it still
didn't work

82
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
didn't work
 

83
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,389
didn't work

105
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,390

oh i figured it out guys i know how to

106
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
oh i figured it out guys i know how to
 

107
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,309
oh i figured it out guys i know how to
do it and i got it set up

108
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
do it and i got it set up
 

109
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,150
do it and i got it set up
this messy massive wiring

110
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
this messy massive wiring
 

111
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,710
this messy massive wiring
does exactly what i want it to do so

112
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
does exactly what i want it to do so
 

113
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,949
does exactly what i want it to do so
i'll just run you through this

114
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
i'll just run you through this
 

115
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,390
i'll just run you through this
so we still let's get this back in

116
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
so we still let's get this back in
 

117
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,309
so we still let's get this back in
we still have it working the way it did

118
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
we still have it working the way it did
 

119
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,670
we still have it working the way it did
before we have the water in there

120
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
before we have the water in there
 

121
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,550
before we have the water in there
if we want to clear the portal press

122
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
if we want to clear the portal press
 

123
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,949
if we want to clear the portal press
that

124
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
that
 

125
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,589
that
as many times as we want

126
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599

 

127
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,270

there we go i guess there's a little bit

128
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
there we go i guess there's a little bit
 

129
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,710
there we go i guess there's a little bit
of a delay before you can hit the button

130
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
of a delay before you can hit the button
 

131
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,430
of a delay before you can hit the button
again

132
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
again
 

133
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,750
again
not that you would ever need to this one

134
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
not that you would ever need to this one
 

135
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,949
not that you would ever need to this one
lights it

137
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,149

that one clears it now this is the new

138
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
that one clears it now this is the new
 

139
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,390
that one clears it now this is the new
option the third option is this piece of

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
option the third option is this piece of
 

141
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,430

redstone
 

143
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,830
redstone
ore actually let's wait before we put

144
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
ore actually let's wait before we put
 

145
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,110
ore actually let's wait before we put
that in

146
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
that in
 

147
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,589
that in
so if i right click it

148
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599

 

149
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,550

enables the portal then when that

150
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
enables the portal then when that
 

151
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,149
enables the portal then when that
redstone or

152
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
redstone or
 

153
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,710
redstone or
stops glowing like that it triggers this

154
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
stops glowing like that it triggers this
 

155
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,589
stops glowing like that it triggers this
but flop or whatever and that makes the

156
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
but flop or whatever and that makes the
 

157
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,670
but flop or whatever and that makes the
water shoot out and disables the portal

158
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
water shoot out and disables the portal
 

159
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,550
water shoot out and disables the portal
the cool thing about this one there it

160
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
the cool thing about this one there it
 

161
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,509
the cool thing about this one there it
goes

162
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
goes
 

163
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,229
goes
cool thing about this one is since it's

164
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
cool thing about this one is since it's
 

165
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,789
cool thing about this one is since it's
um

166
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
um
 

167
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,030
um

a redstone signal a redstone signal is
not occurring so

174
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
not occurring so
 

175
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,070
not occurring so
it doesn't doesn't shut itself off

176
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
it doesn't doesn't shut itself off
 

177
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,070
it doesn't doesn't shut itself off
here i'll show you i can actually use it

178
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
here i'll show you i can actually use it
 

179
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,390
here i'll show you i can actually use it
and this portal will remain even after i

180
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
and this portal will remain even after i
 

181
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,630
and this portal will remain even after i
go into the nether

182
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
go into the nether
 

183
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,869
go into the nether
so i have the option to come back

184
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
so i have the option to come back
 

185
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,509
so i have the option to come back
through that portal before it's disabled

186
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519

 

187
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,710

i hope yep and then

188
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
i hope yep and then
 

189
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,069
i hope yep and then
after well there you go perfect

190
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
after well there you go perfect
 

191
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,469
after well there you go perfect
so once i if i come through a different

192
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
so once i if i come through a different
 

193
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,350
so once i if i come through a different
portal and

194
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
portal and
 

195
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,189
portal and
come back into this area it'll do that

196
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
come back into this area it'll do that
 

197
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,350
come back into this area it'll do that
or if i come through the same portal

198
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
or if i come through the same portal
 

199
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,550
or if i come through the same portal
this one here it'll do that too so

200
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560

 

201
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,909

the wiring is a mess and it could

202
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
the wiring is a mess and it could
 

203
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,350
the wiring is a mess and it could
probably be made a little bit more

204
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
probably be made a little bit more
 

205
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,150
probably be made a little bit more
efficient

206
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
efficient
 

207
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,510
efficient
but you got a

208
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
but you got a
 

209
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,629
but you got a
bud flop over here next to the redstone

210
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
bud flop over here next to the redstone
 

211
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,070
bud flop over here next to the redstone
or block that there's a

212
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
or block that there's a
 

213
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,350
or block that there's a
two two redstone torches depending on

214
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
two two redstone torches depending on
 

215
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,550
two two redstone torches depending on
where this block is

216
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
where this block is
 

217
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,790
where this block is
it powers the stuff so if it's there it

218
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
it powers the stuff so if it's there it
 

219
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,710
it powers the stuff so if it's there it
goes through here

220
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
goes through here
 

221
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,830
goes through here
it goes to this monostable circuit that

222
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
it goes to this monostable circuit that
 

223
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,990
it goes to this monostable circuit that
is set at four

224
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
is set at four
 

225
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,590
is set at four
um and then to the dispenser it sends

226
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
um and then to the dispenser it sends
 

227
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,590
um and then to the dispenser it sends
two pulses

228
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
two pulses
 

229
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,550
two pulses
one that's three ticks long that comes

230
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
one that's three ticks long that comes
 

231
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,230
one that's three ticks long that comes
three ticks later

232
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
three ticks later
 

233
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,710
three ticks later
and same thing with this side

234
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720

 

235
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,350

there's another monostable circuit here

236
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
there's another monostable circuit here
 

237
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,270
there's another monostable circuit here
we really only need one but i have two

238
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
we really only need one but i have two
 

239
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,749
we really only need one but i have two
just because they're spaced out so far

240
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
just because they're spaced out so far
 

241
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,510
just because they're spaced out so far
i figured it'd be easier and

242
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
i figured it'd be easier and
 

243
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,430
i figured it'd be easier and
yeah so i'm sure you could copy it from

244
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
yeah so i'm sure you could copy it from
 

245
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,749
yeah so i'm sure you could copy it from
seeing that or mostly so i'm going to

246
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
seeing that or mostly so i'm going to
 

247
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,950
seeing that or mostly so i'm going to
put this

248
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
put this
 

249
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,950
put this
like this it's not super pretty or

250
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
like this it's not super pretty or
 

251
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,430
like this it's not super pretty or
anything but does what i wanted to do

252
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440

 

253
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,070

all right moving on so there's been some

254
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
all right moving on so there's been some
 

255
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,189
all right moving on so there's been some
changes

256
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
changes
 

257
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,390
changes
with emerald city um

258
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
with emerald city um
 

259
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,710
with emerald city um
i'll take you through them real quick a

260
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
i'll take you through them real quick a
 

261
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,110
i'll take you through them real quick a
lot of people did not like my houses

262
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
lot of people did not like my houses
 

263
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,950
lot of people did not like my houses
i was a bit shocked because i thought

264
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
i was a bit shocked because i thought
 

265
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,309
i was a bit shocked because i thought
they looked pretty good but

266
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
they looked pretty good but
 

267
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,510
they looked pretty good but
no people did not like them

268
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
no people did not like them
 

269
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,110
no people did not like them
at all mostly because of the sandstone

270
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
at all mostly because of the sandstone
 

271
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,350
at all mostly because of the sandstone
so i have tweaked them a little bit

272
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
so i have tweaked them a little bit
 

273
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,790
so i have tweaked them a little bit
they're still

274
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
they're still
 

275
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,390
they're still
still the same shape and everything but

276
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
still the same shape and everything but
 

277
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,950
still the same shape and everything but
i have gotten rid of the sandstone

278
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
i have gotten rid of the sandstone
 

279
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,189
i have gotten rid of the sandstone
and i i didn't think i was going to like

280
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
and i i didn't think i was going to like
 

281
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,110
and i i didn't think i was going to like
them as much after i did that

282
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
them as much after i did that
 

283
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,629
them as much after i did that
but i do like these more now

284
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
but i do like these more now
 

285
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,629
but i do like these more now
and hopefully other people like them a

286
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
and hopefully other people like them a
 

287
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,309
and hopefully other people like them a
bit more too

288
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
bit more too
 

289
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,909
bit more too
and i don't think i'm going to change a

290
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
and i don't think i'm going to change a
 

291
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,150
and i don't think i'm going to change a
b on this even if people don't like it

292
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
b on this even if people don't like it
 

293
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,830
b on this even if people don't like it
just because i think this looks good

294
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
just because i think this looks good
 

295
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,150
just because i think this looks good
and we still have our creeper face um

296
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
and we still have our creeper face um
 

297
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,590
and we still have our creeper face um
now we still i'm still playing with the

298
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
now we still i'm still playing with the
 

299
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,870
now we still i'm still playing with the
floor in here though

300
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
floor in here though
 

301
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,790
floor in here though
somebody suggested i try mossy

302
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
somebody suggested i try mossy
 

303
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,309
somebody suggested i try mossy
cobblestone so that's

304
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
cobblestone so that's
 

305
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,590
cobblestone so that's
what's going on here

306
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600

 

307
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,430

but yeah a lot of the trouble is because

308
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
but yeah a lot of the trouble is because
 

309
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,189
but yeah a lot of the trouble is because
it's swamp grass and there's nothing i

310
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
it's swamp grass and there's nothing i
 

311
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,309
it's swamp grass and there's nothing i
can do about that either

312
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319

 

313
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,990

i don't either get rid of the grass

314
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
i don't either get rid of the grass
 

315
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,110
i don't either get rid of the grass
completely

316
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120

 

317
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,870

this does look kind of cool i don't know

318
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
this does look kind of cool i don't know
 

319
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,189
this does look kind of cool i don't know
i don't know what i'm doing anymore

320
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
i don't know what i'm doing anymore
 

321
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,230
i don't know what i'm doing anymore
uh

322
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240

 

323
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,189

but we'll figure something out i'm sure

324
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
but we'll figure something out i'm sure
 

325
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,469
but we'll figure something out i'm sure
i did kind of want to put

326
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
i did kind of want to put
 

327
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,670
i did kind of want to put
trees in that in here which is why i'm

328
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
trees in that in here which is why i'm
 

329
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,909
trees in that in here which is why i'm
pushing the grass so much if we get rid

330
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
pushing the grass so much if we get rid
 

331
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,270
pushing the grass so much if we get rid
of the grass i don't think we can have

332
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
of the grass i don't think we can have
 

333
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,309
of the grass i don't think we can have
trees and

334
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
trees and
 

335
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,150
trees and
and bushes and flowers or anything

336
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160

 

337
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,230

even i'm not sure if they would work as

338
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
even i'm not sure if they would work as
 

339
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,430
even i'm not sure if they would work as
even with the grass but

340
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
even with the grass but
 

341
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,230
even with the grass but
i would like to try that

342
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
i would like to try that
 

343
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,909
i would like to try that
uh so we're over here now at the ice

344
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
uh so we're over here now at the ice
 

345
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,550
uh so we're over here now at the ice
tray

346
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560

 

347
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,670

oh i was juking them uh

348
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
oh i was juking them uh
 

349
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,469
oh i was juking them uh
version 2.0 has begun i've ripped the

350
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
version 2.0 has begun i've ripped the
 

351
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,270
version 2.0 has begun i've ripped the
old one up

352
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
old one up
 

353
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,830
old one up
and i'm making it bigger changing the

354
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
and i'm making it bigger changing the
 

355
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,710
and i'm making it bigger changing the
pattern

356
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720

 

357
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,029

this is the new pattern like this and

358
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
this is the new pattern like this and
 

359
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,589
this is the new pattern like this and
this is also the pattern i plan on using

360
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
this is also the pattern i plan on using
 

361
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,749
this is also the pattern i plan on using
on the reed farm if i

362
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
on the reed farm if i
 

363
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,909
on the reed farm if i
expand that from now on because i think

364
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
expand that from now on because i think
 

365
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,990
expand that from now on because i think
it's the most efficient

366
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
it's the most efficient
 

367
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,469
it's the most efficient
but yeah the old one was 16 by 16 the

368
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
but yeah the old one was 16 by 16 the
 

369
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,150
but yeah the old one was 16 by 16 the
new one's going to be 32

370
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
new one's going to be 32
 

371
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,430
new one's going to be 32
by 32 which is gonna be

372
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
by 32 which is gonna be
 

373
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,589
by 32 which is gonna be
i think 10 stacks of ice per harvest so

374
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
i think 10 stacks of ice per harvest so
 

375
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,469
i think 10 stacks of ice per harvest so
it's going to be really good um

376
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
it's going to be really good um
 

377
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,150
it's going to be really good um
it's gonna come in handy because i use a

378
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
it's gonna come in handy because i use a
 

379
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,749
it's gonna come in handy because i use a
lot of ice it turns out

380
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
lot of ice it turns out
 

381
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,589
lot of ice it turns out
like a lot of times instead of using

382
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
like a lot of times instead of using
 

383
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,909
like a lot of times instead of using
water buckets and that i'll just use ice

384
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
water buckets and that i'll just use ice
 

385
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,510
water buckets and that i'll just use ice
and it's really handy so

386
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
and it's really handy so
 

387
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,749
and it's really handy so
i'll i'll definitely be making use of it

388
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
i'll i'll definitely be making use of it
 

389
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,510
i'll i'll definitely be making use of it
and this is how i'm doing the wiring i'm

390
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
and this is how i'm doing the wiring i'm
 

391
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,150
and this is how i'm doing the wiring i'm
not sure if it's the best way

392
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
not sure if it's the best way
 

393
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,070
not sure if it's the best way
uh but it's definitely the easiest for

394
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
uh but it's definitely the easiest for
 

395
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,670
uh but it's definitely the easiest for
me to

396
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
me to
 

397
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,670
me to
do it because it's an easy repeatable

398
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
do it because it's an easy repeatable
 

399
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,670
do it because it's an easy repeatable
pattern

400
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
pattern
 

401
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,949
pattern
um just just show you so i would have

402
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
um just just show you so i would have
 

403
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,550
um just just show you so i would have
when this is all done i'll have one wire

404
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
when this is all done i'll have one wire
 

405
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,110
when this is all done i'll have one wire
going uh horizontally

406
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
going uh horizontally
 

407
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,790
going uh horizontally
which will connect to all these these

408
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
which will connect to all these these
 

409
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,070
which will connect to all these these
threads and it will

410
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
threads and it will
 

411
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,710
threads and it will
do this goes goes all the way down like

412
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
do this goes goes all the way down like
 

413
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,110
do this goes goes all the way down like
that

414
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
that
 

415
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,590
that
so pretty simple pattern

416
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600

 

417
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,910

uh so i'm just about done laying my pad

418
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
uh so i'm just about done laying my pad
 

419
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,509
uh so i'm just about done laying my pad
here i ran out of blocks

420
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
here i ran out of blocks
 

421
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,910
here i ran out of blocks
gotta get some more but i just wanna

422
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
gotta get some more but i just wanna
 

423
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,829
gotta get some more but i just wanna
give you a feel for the actual size of

424
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
give you a feel for the actual size of
 

425
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,710
give you a feel for the actual size of
this thing

426
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
this thing
 

427
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,230
this thing
this is like three quarters of it it's

428
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
this is like three quarters of it it's
 

429
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,150
this is like three quarters of it it's
large it's very large

430
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160

 

431
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,230

a lot of area so

432
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
a lot of area so
 

433
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,670
a lot of area so
i should go quick though there's not

434
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
i should go quick though there's not
 

435
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,389
i should go quick though there's not
really much to building this thing

436
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399

 

437
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,509

oh man it always happens like

438
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
oh man it always happens like
 

439
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,269
oh man it always happens like
when i'm doing stuff like this i usually

440
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
when i'm doing stuff like this i usually
 

441
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,949
when i'm doing stuff like this i usually
i'm watching a video you know i'm not

442
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
i'm watching a video you know i'm not
 

443
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,310
i'm watching a video you know i'm not
really paying attention

444
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
really paying attention
 

445
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,829
really paying attention
to what i'm doing and always happens

446
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
to what i'm doing and always happens
 

447
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,550
to what i'm doing and always happens
when i'm

448
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
when i'm
 

449
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,190
when i'm
just about at level 30 creeper comes up

450
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
just about at level 30 creeper comes up
 

451
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,829
just about at level 30 creeper comes up
wrecks your day man

452
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839

 

453
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,829

so much stuff

454
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839

 

455
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,350

uh but yeah we're making good progress

456
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
uh but yeah we're making good progress
 

457
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,949
uh but yeah we're making good progress
here

458
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959

 

459
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,870

um

460
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880

 

461
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,590

making good progress and gonna put the

462
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
making good progress and gonna put the
 

463
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,630
making good progress and gonna put the
pistons in now

464
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
pistons in now
 

465
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,990
pistons in now
just gotta go all the way along

466
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
just gotta go all the way along
 

467
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,350
just gotta go all the way along
do that it's gonna be

468
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
do that it's gonna be
 

469
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,790
do that it's gonna be
i think three or four stacks oops

470
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
i think three or four stacks oops
 

471
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,509
i think three or four stacks oops
and then cover that with snow

472
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519

 

473
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:58,829

amazing montage begin

474
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

475
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:40,829

excellent

476
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839

 

477
00:11:40,839 --> 00:12:08,829

incredible

478
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839

 

479
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:36,829

amazing

481
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:50,829

terrific

482
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

483

489
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,150

magnificent

490
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160

 

491
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,389

yes so it is done i think it's all done

492
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
yes so it is done i think it's all done
 

493

yes so it is done i think it's all done
this is going to be our first

494
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
this is going to be our first
 

495
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,790
this is going to be our first
test see if it actually works

496
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
test see if it actually works
 

497
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,150
test see if it actually works
uh this controls that that makes it so

498
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
uh this controls that that makes it so
 

499
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,710
uh this controls that that makes it so
the water freezes quicker because

500
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
the water freezes quicker because
 

501
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,030
the water freezes quicker because
otherwise it freezes on the outside only

502
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
otherwise it freezes on the outside only
 

503
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,590
otherwise it freezes on the outside only
and slowly freezes inward this way

504
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
and slowly freezes inward this way
 

505
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,189
and slowly freezes inward this way
since there's a block next to every

506
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
since there's a block next to every
 

507
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,509
since there's a block next to every
single water block it will freeze very

508
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
single water block it will freeze very
 

509
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,030
single water block it will freeze very
quickly

510
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040

 

511
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,030

and this does the double pulse so here

512
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
and this does the double pulse so here
 

513
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,189
and this does the double pulse so here
we go first test

514
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
we go first test
 

515
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,629
we go first test
let's hope it works

516
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639

 

517
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,990

it's looking good looking very good oh

518
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
it's looking good looking very good oh
 

519
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,189
it's looking good looking very good oh
look at all that water

520
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199

 

521
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,430

yeah i think it made it all the way

522
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440

 

523
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,030

and they still have water so it picked

524
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
and they still have water so it picked
 

525
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,430
and they still have water so it picked
up the water again it's good

526
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
up the water again it's good
 

527
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,030
up the water again it's good
double pulsed and i think

528
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
double pulsed and i think
 

529
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,230
double pulsed and i think
let's give this a go

530
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240

 

531
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,550

oh couple ice blocks went up because we

532
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
oh couple ice blocks went up because we
 

533
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,430
oh couple ice blocks went up because we
did not

534
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
did not
 

535
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,110
did not
do use that quick but look how quick

536
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
do use that quick but look how quick
 

537
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,150
do use that quick but look how quick
it's freezing stuff in the middle

538
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160

 

539
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,230

ah this is going to come in handy this

540
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
ah this is going to come in handy this
 

541
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,189

gonna stop
this is my first ice harvest with this

550
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
this is my first ice harvest with this
 

551
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,110
this is my first ice harvest with this
new

552
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
new
 

553
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,189
new
ice tray uh froze over very quickly i'm

554
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
ice tray uh froze over very quickly i'm
 

555
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,629
ice tray uh froze over very quickly i'm
happy with it

556

happy with it
 

557
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,110
happy with it
i'm going to try i've never tried this

558
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
i'm going to try i've never tried this
 

559
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,470
i'm going to try i've never tried this
before but i have

560
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
before but i have
 

561
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,310
before but i have
a silk touch shovel um with efficiency

562
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
a silk touch shovel um with efficiency
 

563
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,069
a silk touch shovel um with efficiency
on i'm not sure if the efficiency works

564
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
on i'm not sure if the efficiency works
 

565
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,470
on i'm not sure if the efficiency works
or

566
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
or
 

567
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,189
or
if you can even pick up ice with it i

568
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
if you can even pick up ice with it i
 

569
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,150
if you can even pick up ice with it i
think you can pick up the ice

570
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
think you can pick up the ice
 

571
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,230
think you can pick up the ice
i'm just not sure if i'm guessing the

572
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
i'm just not sure if i'm guessing the
 

573
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,829
i'm just not sure if i'm guessing the
efficiency will work too but we'll see

574
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
efficiency will work too but we'll see
 

575
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,590
efficiency will work too but we'll see
we'll see what happens here

576
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
we'll see what happens here
 

577
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,829
we'll see what happens here
i i don't really want to use these too

578
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
i i don't really want to use these too
 

579
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,189
i i don't really want to use these too
often because if i

580
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
often because if i
 

581
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,189
often because if i
if i hit the snow it's gone the shovel

582
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
if i hit the snow it's gone the shovel
 

583
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,509
if i hit the snow it's gone the shovel
will just destroy it

584
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
will just destroy it
 

585
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,790
will just destroy it
okay it picks up the ice and it is quick

586
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
okay it picks up the ice and it is quick
 

587
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,949
okay it picks up the ice and it is quick
okay it's not the ideal tool for this

588
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
okay it's not the ideal tool for this
 

589
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,870
okay it's not the ideal tool for this
though because

590
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
though because
 

591
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,710
though because
like i said if i hit the snow i'm gonna

592
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
like i said if i hit the snow i'm gonna
 

593
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,350
like i said if i hit the snow i'm gonna
have to do repairs

594
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
have to do repairs
 

595
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,150
have to do repairs
be very careful but i only have i think

596
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
be very careful but i only have i think
 

597
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,230
be very careful but i only have i think
one silk touch pick left

598
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
one silk touch pick left
 

599
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,629
one silk touch pick left
and i may have a few shovels

600
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
and i may have a few shovels
 

601
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,790
and i may have a few shovels
but i would like to get some new picks

602
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
but i would like to get some new picks
 

603
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,670
but i would like to get some new picks
for sure

604
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
for sure
 

605
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,509
for sure
sometime soon

606
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519

 

607
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,150

and in total from one harvest we got one

608
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
and in total from one harvest we got one
 

609
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,310
and in total from one harvest we got one
two three four five six seven eight

610
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
two three four five six seven eight
 

611
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,470
two three four five six seven eight
nine 10 11 12 stacks just about 13

612
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
nine 10 11 12 stacks just about 13
 

613
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,150
nine 10 11 12 stacks just about 13
and i added it up and it is 823 ice

614
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
and i added it up and it is 823 ice
 

615
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,430
and i added it up and it is 823 ice
blocks

616
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
blocks
 

617
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,870
blocks
so pretty good won't have to come here

618
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
so pretty good won't have to come here
 

619
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,629
so pretty good won't have to come here
too often to do this

620
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639

 

621
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,150

623
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,710

no what happened why didn't it pick up

624
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
no what happened why didn't it pick up
 

625
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,470
no what happened why didn't it pick up
the water

626
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
the water
 

627
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,470
the water
ah just this side too that's strange

628
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480

 

629
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,350

one two three four five six seven eight

630
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
one two three four five six seven eight
 

631
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,990
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten

632
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
nine ten
 

633
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,309
nine ten

eleven twelve thirteen hmm
 

635
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,750
eleven twelve thirteen hmm
not sure why i did that

636
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760

 

637
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,990

must have been just after the repeater

638
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
must have been just after the repeater
 

639
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,110
must have been just after the repeater
yeah

640
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
yeah
 

641
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,829
yeah
something's wrong with it

642
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839

 

643
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,350

well i'll look into fixing that i'm not

644
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
well i'll look into fixing that i'm not
 

645
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,029
well i'll look into fixing that i'm not
sure what happened there

646
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
sure what happened there
 

647
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,950
sure what happened there
okay let's try it again real quick here

648
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
okay let's try it again real quick here
 

649
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:38,710
okay let's try it again real quick here
before the ice freezes

650
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720

 

651
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,070

oh i forgot the bucket it's like what

652
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
oh i forgot the bucket it's like what
 

653
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,430
oh i forgot the bucket it's like what
what's going on um i also seem to have a

654
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
what's going on um i also seem to have a
 

655
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,430
what's going on um i also seem to have a
lot of budgets now i'm not exactly sure

656
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
lot of budgets now i'm not exactly sure
 

657
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,150
lot of budgets now i'm not exactly sure
why

658
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160

 

659
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,549

it's all very confusing

660
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559

 

661
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,110

see if any of these shout outs there's

662
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
see if any of these shout outs there's
 

663
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,950
see if any of these shout outs there's
ice in front of the dispensers

664
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
ice in front of the dispensers
 

665
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,390
ice in front of the dispensers
uh instead of placing the water

666
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
uh instead of placing the water
 

667
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,830
uh instead of placing the water
it's gonna shoot the bucket out so you

668
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
it's gonna shoot the bucket out so you
 

669
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,470
it's gonna shoot the bucket out so you
gotta be really careful

670
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
gotta be really careful
 

671
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,390
gotta be really careful
okay i think it's fixed what i did is i

672
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
okay i think it's fixed what i did is i
 

673
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,789
okay i think it's fixed what i did is i
just increased the delay

674
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
just increased the delay
 

675
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,430
just increased the delay
before the second pulse occurs i had 11

676
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
before the second pulse occurs i had 11
 

677
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,909
before the second pulse occurs i had 11
ticks before now i have it at 12.

678
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
ticks before now i have it at 12.
 

679
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,310
ticks before now i have it at 12.
i think that was the issue although it

680
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320

799
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,669

the way it's implemented or at least

800
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
the way it's implemented or at least
 

801
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,270
the way it's implemented or at least
right now from what i've heard

you get from the mobs by one every
so many seconds i think it's like 25 or

808
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
so many seconds i think it's like 25 or
 

809
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,390
so many seconds i think it's like 25 or
30 or something

810
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
30 or something
 

811
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,830
30 or something
um i think now i'm just going by

812
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
um i think now i'm just going by
 

813
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,430
um i think now i'm just going by
guessing here i haven't actually tried

814
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
guessing here i haven't actually tried
 

815
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,149
guessing here i haven't actually tried
this

816
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
this
 

817
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,149
this
or tried any of the snapshots yet but i

818
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
or tried any of the snapshots yet but i
 

819
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,510
or tried any of the snapshots yet but i
think

820
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
think
 

821
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,830
think
you could set yourself up on a minecart

822
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
you could set yourself up on a minecart
 

823
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,590
you could set yourself up on a minecart
or something that moved out of range for

824
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
or something that moved out of range for
 

825
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,789
or something that moved out of range for
the spawners

826
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
the spawners
 

827
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,549
the spawners
at the precise time where it attempts to

828
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
at the precise time where it attempts to
 

829
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,110
at the precise time where it attempts to
decrease xp by one and then move

830
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
decrease xp by one and then move
 

831
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,029
decrease xp by one and then move
yourself back

832
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
yourself back
 

833
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,590
yourself back
i think i don't know but that might be

834
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
i think i don't know but that might be
 

835
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,390
i think i don't know but that might be
an exploit because it's not a constant

836
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
an exploit because it's not a constant
 

837
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,070
