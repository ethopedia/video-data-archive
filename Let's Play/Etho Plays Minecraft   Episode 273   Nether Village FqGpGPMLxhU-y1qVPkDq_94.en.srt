um like i think the last thing we did is
 

51
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,469
um like i think the last thing we did is
we installed these things

52
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
we installed these things
 

53
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,710
we installed these things
and now i need to connect those to

54
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
and now i need to connect those to
 

55
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,350
and now i need to connect those to
his health variable over here

56
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360

 

57
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,310

it's all very complicated it's not easy

58
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
it's all very complicated it's not easy
 

59
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,910
it's all very complicated it's not easy
to work on this i gotta say like it

60
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
to work on this i gotta say like it
 

61
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,350
to work on this i gotta say like it
takes a lot of planning

62
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
takes a lot of planning
 

63
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,510
takes a lot of planning
and i got this problem where i over

64
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
and i got this problem where i over
 

65
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,429
and i got this problem where i over
analyze stuff and i really plan

66
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
analyze stuff and i really plan
 

67

stuff out because i want to get it right

68
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
stuff out because i want to get it right
 

69
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,830
stuff out because i want to get it right
the first time i do it and that's

70
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
the first time i do it and that's
 

71
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,350
the first time i do it and that's
that's not a good way of going about

72
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
that's not a good way of going about
 

73
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,270
that's not a good way of going about
things because

74
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
things because
 

75
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
things because
it takes a lot of time to figure it out

76
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
it takes a lot of time to figure it out
 

77
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,230
it takes a lot of time to figure it out
perfect without making a few mistakes

78
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240

 

79
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,270

this is a test i was doing

80
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
this is a test i was doing
 

81
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,469
this is a test i was doing
like i think i'm just going to start

82
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
like i think i'm just going to start
 

83
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,149
like i think i'm just going to start

something gets in the way of something
 

87
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,630
something gets in the way of something
else i'll

88
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
else i'll
 

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,190
else i'll
i'll move it and figure it out later

90
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
i'll move it and figure it out later
 

91
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,870
i'll move it and figure it out later
but i just need to get it done uh i set

92
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
but i just need to get it done uh i set
 

93
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,990
but i just need to get it done uh i set
this little test up

94
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
this little test up
 

95
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,350
this little test up
because it looked like these comparator

96
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
because it looked like these comparator
 

97
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,949
because it looked like these comparator
clocks are running faster than the

98
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
clocks are running faster than the
 

99
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,389
clocks are running faster than the
repeater for some reason but

100
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
repeater for some reason but
 

101
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,550
repeater for some reason but
i think it was just a trick with my eyes

102
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
i think it was just a trick with my eyes
 

103
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,229
i think it was just a trick with my eyes
seems to work okay

104
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239

 

105
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,790

oh man let me up

106
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
oh man let me up
 

107
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,470
oh man let me up
so we have 12 and 12 in those droppers

108
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
so we have 12 and 12 in those droppers
 

109
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,990
so we have 12 and 12 in those droppers
one of the droppers is before the

110
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
one of the droppers is before the
 

111
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,910
one of the droppers is before the
repeater one is after it

112
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
repeater one is after it
 

113
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,270
repeater one is after it
and if we give it a pulse

114
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280

 

115
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,350

it turns out they shoot out the same

116
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
it turns out they shoot out the same
 

117
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,550
it turns out they shoot out the same
number of items so

118
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
number of items so
 

119
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,030
number of items so
it should work if i hook up repeaters

120
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
it should work if i hook up repeaters
 

121
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,470
it should work if i hook up repeaters
but anyway

122
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
but anyway
 

123
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,509
but anyway
i'm going to work on this a bit and if i

00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
update by the level of his happiness
 

173
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,350
update by the level of his happiness
his hunger and his weight those three

174
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
his hunger and his weight those three
 

175
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,869
his hunger and his weight those three
get put together and

176
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
get put together and
 

177
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,430
get put together and
it either increases or decreases based

178
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
it either increases or decreases based
 

179
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,550
it either increases or decreases based
on them

180
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
on them
 

181
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,430
on them
so if his weight is at zero like it is

182
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
so if his weight is at zero like it is
 

183
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,830
so if his weight is at zero like it is
now

184
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
now
 

185
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,110
now
or one or five there's no

186
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
or one or five there's no
 

187
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,390
or one or five there's no
increase to hunger or to health if it's

188
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
increase to hunger or to health if it's
 

189
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,350
increase to hunger or to health if it's
at one

190
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
at one
 

191
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,149
at one
or if it's at two or four it goes up by

192
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
or if it's at two or four it goes up by
 

193
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,190
or if it's at two or four it goes up by
one

194
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
one
 

195
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,550
one
and at level three it goes up by two

196
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
and at level three it goes up by two
 

197
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,630
and at level three it goes up by two
and then for happiness and hunger

198
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
and then for happiness and hunger
 

199
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,750
and then for happiness and hunger
this level here is zero this would be

200
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
this level here is zero this would be
 

201
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,390
this level here is zero this would be
one this

202
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
one this
 

203
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,789
one this
two three and 4 for both of them so

204
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
two three and 4 for both of them so
 

205
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,789
two three and 4 for both of them so
the increase we should get from this is

206
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
the increase we should get from this is
 

207
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,310
the increase we should get from this is
0 for that

208
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
0 for that
 

209
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,189
0 for that
plus 1 for happiness and then plus 4 for

210
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
plus 1 for happiness and then plus 4 for
 

211
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,790
plus 1 for happiness and then plus 4 for
hunger so 5 is our total number there

212
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
hunger so 5 is our total number there
 

213
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,189
hunger so 5 is our total number there
so now let's just check this out make

214
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
so now let's just check this out make
 

215
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,590
so now let's just check this out make
sure it works

216
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600

 

217
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,749

this is the variable variable pulse

218
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
this is the variable variable pulse
 

219
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,830
this is the variable variable pulse
extender so

220
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
extender so
 

221
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,430
extender so
not going to get into too much detail

222
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
not going to get into too much detail
 

223
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,350
not going to get into too much detail
but basically we take all three of those

224
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
but basically we take all three of those
 

225
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,030
but basically we take all three of those
that we set up

226
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
that we set up
 

227
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,749
that we set up
merge them together all the pulses go

228
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
merge them together all the pulses go
 

229
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,230
merge them together all the pulses go
down this wire to

230
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
down this wire to
 

231
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,390
down this wire to
wilson's health variable here

232
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
wilson's health variable here
 

233
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,629
wilson's health variable here
every time this dropper gets a pulse it

234
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
every time this dropper gets a pulse it
 

235
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,390
every time this dropper gets a pulse it
sends one item into this one

236
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
sends one item into this one
 

237
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,749
sends one item into this one
and it increases his health by one

238
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
and it increases his health by one
 

239
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,469
and it increases his health by one
so since it's supposed to increase it by

240
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
so since it's supposed to increase it by
 

241
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,629
so since it's supposed to increase it by
five

242
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
five
 

243
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,830
five
uh there's there should be five less in

244
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
uh there's there should be five less in
 

245
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,469
uh there's there should be five less in
here

246
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
here
 

247
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,550
here
once we cause it to update which we can

248
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
once we cause it to update which we can
 

249
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,270
once we cause it to update which we can
do with this

250
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280

 

251
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,110

one two three four five very good

252
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
one two three four five very good
 

253
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,909
one two three four five very good
very good let's just check it so this

254
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
very good let's just check it so this
 

255
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,469
very good let's just check it so this
was at

256
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
was at
 

257
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,029
was at
14 now it's down to nine so that is five

258
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
14 now it's down to nine so that is five
 

259
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,270
14 now it's down to nine so that is five
and if we fool around with some of these

260
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
and if we fool around with some of these
 

261
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,029
and if we fool around with some of these
other variables it should change the

262
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
other variables it should change the
 

263
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,350
other variables it should change the
number of pulses so let's

264
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
number of pulses so let's
 

265
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,950
number of pulses so let's
do that it's really only

266
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
do that it's really only
 

267
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,350
do that it's really only
there's not many of these in here um

268
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
there's not many of these in here um
 

269
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,670
there's not many of these in here um
this is his happiness

270
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680

 

271
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,950

let's go see what that did i'm not sure

272
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
let's go see what that did i'm not sure
 

273
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,110
let's go see what that did i'm not sure
if i increased it or decreased it

274
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
if i increased it or decreased it
 

275
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,350
if i increased it or decreased it
it was at two before now it's at three

276
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
it was at two before now it's at three
 

277
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,310
it was at two before now it's at three
he's got a straight face

278
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
he's got a straight face
 

279
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,309
he's got a straight face
alright so that should be six pulses now

280
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
alright so that should be six pulses now
 

281
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,110
alright so that should be six pulses now
let's just check that out

282
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120

 

283
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,629

and then i'll get back to work on it

284
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
and then i'll get back to work on it
 

285
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,550
and then i'll get back to work on it
here ah

286
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
here ah
 

287
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,070
here ah
oh i hate walking around this guy

288
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
oh i hate walking around this guy
 

289
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,870
oh i hate walking around this guy
there's so many places to fall

290
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
there's so many places to fall
 

291
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,749
there's so many places to fall
all right we want six pulses that was at

292
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
all right we want six pulses that was at
 

293
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,510
all right we want six pulses that was at
nine

294
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
nine
 

295
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,590
nine
one two three four five six i think you

296
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
one two three four five six i think you
 

297
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,430
one two three four five six i think you
did it

298
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
did it
 

299
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,110
did it
this was a nine it should be at three

300
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
this was a nine it should be at three
 

301
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,749
this was a nine it should be at three
very good so

302
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
very good so
 

303
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,110
very good so
i think it's working i'm going to try a

304
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
i think it's working i'm going to try a
 

305
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,749
i think it's working i'm going to try a
few other numbers here just to make sure

306
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
few other numbers here just to make sure
 

307
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,749
few other numbers here just to make sure
uh but then i'm going to try do some

308
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
uh but then i'm going to try do some
 

309
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,110
uh but then i'm going to try do some
other

310
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
other
 

311
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,629
other
his other stats here i'm going to try to

312
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
his other stats here i'm going to try to
 

313
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,270
his other stats here i'm going to try to
work those out too maybe today

314
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
work those out too maybe today
 

315
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,469
work those out too maybe today
and i'll be right back

316
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479

 

317
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,390

yeah so i tried out a bunch of different

318
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
yeah so i tried out a bunch of different
 

319
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,550
yeah so i tried out a bunch of different
other combinations of these three stats

320
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
other combinations of these three stats
 

321
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,909
other combinations of these three stats
and they all seemed to work the way that

322
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
and they all seemed to work the way that
 

323
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,150
and they all seemed to work the way that
i intended them to uh

324
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
i intended them to uh
 

325
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,029
i intended them to uh
at the very least he gained zero health

326
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
at the very least he gained zero health
 

327
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,909
at the very least he gained zero health
points back

328
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
points back
 

329
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,589
points back
per updates at the max he gains 10

330
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
per updates at the max he gains 10
 

331
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,909
per updates at the max he gains 10
back but every update i'm supposed to

332
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
back but every update i'm supposed to
 

333
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,629
back but every update i'm supposed to
make it

334
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
make it
 

335
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,510
make it
subtract six from him as well so if he

336
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
subtract six from him as well so if he
 

337
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,350
subtract six from him as well so if he
gains zero and he subtracts six then

338
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
gains zero and he subtracts six then
 

339
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,270
gains zero and he subtracts six then
that goes down by six points

340
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
that goes down by six points
 

341
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,710
that goes down by six points
um if i subtract six and it goes up by

342
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
um if i subtract six and it goes up by
 

343
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,510
um if i subtract six and it goes up by
ten he gains

344
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
ten he gains
 

345
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,670
ten he gains
four so that's that's the way it's going

346
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
four so that's that's the way it's going
 

347
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,710
four so that's that's the way it's going
to be

348
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
to be
 

349
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
to be
and that'll determine if that goes up

350
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
and that'll determine if that goes up
 

351
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,990
and that'll determine if that goes up
and down now

352
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
and down now
 

353
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,830

to zero
 

471
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,790
to zero
at the moment i don't have it set up

472
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
at the moment i don't have it set up
 

473
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,990
at the moment i don't have it set up
where

474
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
where
 

475
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,310
where
anything is subtracting though so it's

476
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
anything is subtracting though so it's
 

477
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,230
anything is subtracting though so it's
not quite at that point yet but that

478
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
not quite at that point yet but that
 

479
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,470
not quite at that point yet but that
will be pretty easy to do

480
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
will be pretty easy to do
 

481
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,590
will be pretty easy to do
um what i was going to do

482
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600

let's get this reset back to zero for

486
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
let's get this reset back to zero for
 

487
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,870
let's get this reset back to zero for
both of them

488
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
both of them
 

489
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,990
both of them
all right so zero zero if we go over

490
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
all right so zero zero if we go over
 

491
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,470
all right so zero zero if we go over
here

492
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
here
 

493
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,550
here

506
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
flickers and i now have this set up here
 

507
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,470
flickers and i now have this set up here
it goes to two different pulse extenders

508
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
it goes to two different pulse extenders
 

509
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,550
it goes to two different pulse extenders
the one on the right here is for the

510
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
the one on the right here is for the
 

511
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,550
the one on the right here is for the
steak it's a little bit longer

512
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
steak it's a little bit longer
 

513
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,590
steak it's a little bit longer
and this one is for the cookies so this

514
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
and this one is for the cookies so this
 

515
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,990
and this one is for the cookies so this
one

516
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000

 

517
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,150

then you well they both go to one of

518
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
then you well they both go to one of
 

519
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,829
then you well they both go to one of
these comparator clocks this one will

520
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
these comparator clocks this one will
 

521
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,310
these comparator clocks this one will
pulse

522
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
pulse
 

523
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,110
pulse
12 times this one pulses six times

524
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
12 times this one pulses six times
 

525
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,150
12 times this one pulses six times
because it's all

526
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
because it's all
 

527
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,670
because it's all
a shorter duration

528
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
a shorter duration
 

529
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,949
a shorter duration
and then they go up here

530
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959

 

531
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,310

the hunger value from the steak and from

532
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
the hunger value from the steak and from
 

533
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,550
the hunger value from the steak and from
the cookies joined together here

534
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
the cookies joined together here
 

535
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,110
the cookies joined together here
and they keep going up further but for

536
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
and they keep going up further but for
 

537
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,269
and they keep going up further but for
the cookies i have it split off before

538
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
the cookies i have it split off before
 

539
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,910
the cookies i have it split off before
that

540
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
that
 

541
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,310
that
and it goes up the staircase

542
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320

 

543
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,949

here and that goes up to the happiness

544
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
here and that goes up to the happiness
 

545
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,710
here and that goes up to the happiness
variable

546
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
variable
 

547
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,829
variable
here so so it sends

548
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
here so so it sends
 

549
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,910
here so so it sends
six pulses to this dropper and those go

550
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
six pulses to this dropper and those go
 

551
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,949
six pulses to this dropper and those go
into here

552
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
into here
 

553
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,430
into here
basically oh now i've done it

554
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
basically oh now i've done it
 

555
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,590
basically oh now i've done it
and just a quick demonstration if we are

556
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
and just a quick demonstration if we are
 

557
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,670
and just a quick demonstration if we are
quick enough we can

558
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
quick enough we can
 

559
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,870
quick enough we can
go down and watch it move

560
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
go down and watch it move
 

561
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,870
go down and watch it move
so you see that that wire pulsing six

562
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
so you see that that wire pulsing six
 

563
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,870
so you see that that wire pulsing six
times

564
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
times
 

565
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,190
times
i just made it so the hunger and the

566
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
i just made it so the hunger and the
 

567
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,190
i just made it so the hunger and the
happiness he gets back from cookies

568
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
happiness he gets back from cookies
 

569
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,310
happiness he gets back from cookies
is done by the same pulse extender just

570
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
is done by the same pulse extender just
 

571
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,870
is done by the same pulse extender just
to simplify it

572
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
to simplify it
 

573
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,150
to simplify it
um steak should make it pulse 12 times

574
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160

 

575
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,509

oh i can't see it it's behind there

576
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519

 

577
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,990

anyway you get the idea

578
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000

 

579
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,230

very cool so wilson we got a lot done on

580
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
very cool so wilson we got a lot done on
 

581
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,829
very cool so wilson we got a lot done on
youtube today guy

582
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
youtube today guy
 

583
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,670
youtube today guy
a little bit more work and i think he'll

584
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
a little bit more work and i think he'll
 

585
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,870
a little bit more work and i think he'll
be pretty close to

586
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
be pretty close to
 

587
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,670
be pretty close to
all done or at least working phase then

588
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
all done or at least working phase then
 

589
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,350
all done or at least working phase then
we'll probably do a bunch of tweaking

590
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
we'll probably do a bunch of tweaking
 

591
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,870
we'll probably do a bunch of tweaking
too

592
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880

 

593
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,470

all right guys moving on here um

594
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
all right guys moving on here um
 

595
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,710
all right guys moving on here um
i'm gonna do a test right now got some

596
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
i'm gonna do a test right now got some
 

597
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,310
i'm gonna do a test right now got some
of this hardened clay

598
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
of this hardened clay
 

599
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,870
of this hardened clay
i want to see how it stands up to a

600
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
i want to see how it stands up to a
 

601
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,829
i want to see how it stands up to a
creeper blast

602
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
creeper blast
 

603
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,750
creeper blast
because when i was building the path the

604
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
because when i was building the path the
 

605
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,990
because when i was building the path the
other day

606
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
other day
 

607
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,430
other day
oh i'm not ready for you just yet

608
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
oh i'm not ready for you just yet
 

609
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,389
oh i'm not ready for you just yet
no when i was building that path the

610
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
no when i was building that path the
 

611
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,269
no when i was building that path the
other day

612
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
other day
 

613
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,269
other day
i had quite a few creepers blow up near

614
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
i had quite a few creepers blow up near
 

615
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,910
i had quite a few creepers blow up near
it and it didn't seem to take any damage

616
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
it and it didn't seem to take any damage
 

617
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,269
it and it didn't seem to take any damage
which i thought was kind of interesting

618
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279

 

619
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,750

so i'm just going to set up like a wall

620
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
so i'm just going to set up like a wall
 

621
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,870
so i'm just going to set up like a wall
get a creeper over here

622
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
get a creeper over here
 

623
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,190
get a creeper over here
blow up and then depending on how this

624
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
blow up and then depending on how this
 

625
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,590
blow up and then depending on how this
goes

626
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
goes
 

627
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,190
goes
we might use this for a build idea

628
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200

 

629
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,790

all right he's right by here

630
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800

 

631
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,829

okay

632
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839

 

633
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,670

all right so it's pretty good resistance

634
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
all right so it's pretty good resistance
 

635
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,949
all right so it's pretty good resistance
it's not

636
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
it's not
 

637
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,310
it's not
it's not uh creeper proof obviously

638
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
it's not uh creeper proof obviously
 

639
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,069
it's not uh creeper proof obviously
uh we're gonna go to the nether now and

640
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
uh we're gonna go to the nether now and
 

641
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,710
uh we're gonna go to the nether now and
see how it oh

642
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
see how it oh
 

643
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,150
see how it oh
or not i tried to jump in the water i

644
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
or not i tried to jump in the water i
 

645
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,190
or not i tried to jump in the water i
didn't do it quick enough

646
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
didn't do it quick enough
 

647
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,710
didn't do it quick enough
darn it um

648
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
darn it um
 

649
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,990
darn it um
we're gonna go to the nether and see how

650
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
we're gonna go to the nether and see how
 

651
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,710
we're gonna go to the nether and see how
it stands up against gas

652
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720

 

653
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,190

okay there's a gas there uh what i want

654
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
okay there's a gas there uh what i want
 

655
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,350
okay there's a gas there uh what i want
to find out is if we can use this stuff

656
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
to find out is if we can use this stuff
 

657
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,710
to find out is if we can use this stuff
as a building material

658
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
as a building material
 

659
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,460
as a building material
here in the nether because

660
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,470
here in the nether because
 

661
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,350
here in the nether because

[Music]
 

663
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,230
[Music]
this stuff is actually kind of colorful

664
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
this stuff is actually kind of colorful
 

665
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,310
this stuff is actually kind of colorful
oh yeah

666
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
oh yeah
 

667
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,430
oh yeah
i like the looks of that

668
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
i like the looks of that
 

669
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,590
i like the looks of that
come on one more just to confirm

670
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
come on one more just to confirm
 

671
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,269
come on one more just to confirm
a little too high gotta get them like

672
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
a little too high gotta get them like
 

673
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,949
a little too high gotta get them like
right here

674
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959

 

675
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,509

there we go yeah so it's gas proof and

676
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
there we go yeah so it's gas proof and
 

677
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,949

that's really neat that uh those resist
 

713
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,750
that's really neat that uh those resist
gas explosions because

714
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
gas explosions because
 

715
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,910
gas explosions because
there's actually not a lot of different

716
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
there's actually not a lot of different
 

717
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,509
there's actually not a lot of different
types of blocks

718
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
types of blocks
 

719
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,990
types of blocks
you can use in the nether that don't

720
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
you can use in the nether that don't
 

721
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,750

723
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,949
blow up like
um wool wood

724
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
um wool wood
 

725
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,670
um wool wood
sandstone all pretty much all bright or

726

warm colors
 

729
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,509
warm colors
are not gas proof in this game

730
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
are not gas proof in this game
 

731
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,430
are not gas proof in this game
so if the hardened clay works that's

732
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
so if the hardened clay works that's
 

733
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,990
so if the hardened clay works that's
awesome because that's like 16

734
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
awesome because that's like 16
 

735
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,030
awesome because that's like 16
fairly like versatile colors you can use

736
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
fairly like versatile colors you can use
 

737
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,990
fairly like versatile colors you can use
in the nether

738
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
in the nether
 

739
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,110
in the nether
without having to worry and we're going

740
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
without having to worry and we're going
 

741
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,870
without having to worry and we're going
to use those

742
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
to use those
 

743
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,030
to use those
right away here for a little experiment

744
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
right away here for a little experiment
 

745
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,790
right away here for a little experiment
i want to do

746
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
i want to do
 

747
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,310
i want to do
i've been really interested in the

748
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
i've been really interested in the
 

749
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,710
i've been really interested in the
nether lately actually

750
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
nether lately actually
 

751
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,069
nether lately actually
after that beacon test last episode

752
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
after that beacon test last episode
 

753
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,509
after that beacon test last episode
i figure it's probably possible to

754
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
i figure it's probably possible to
 

755
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,910
i figure it's probably possible to
build a fully working or fully

756
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
build a fully working or fully
 

757
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,189
build a fully working or fully
functioning village

758
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
functioning village
 

759
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,110
functioning village
in the nether because uh the skylight

760
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
in the nether because uh the skylight
 

761
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,269
in the nether because uh the skylight
actually gets down like through the

762
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
actually gets down like through the
 

763
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,790
actually gets down like through the
bedrock through the netherrack um

764
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
bedrock through the netherrack um
 

765
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,710
bedrock through the netherrack um
this this isn't new information this is

766
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
this this isn't new information this is
 

767
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,790
this this isn't new information this is
like like even when i was

768
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
like like even when i was
 

769
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,550
like like even when i was
goofing around with netherwart a long

770
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
goofing around with netherwart a long
 

771
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,069
goofing around with netherwart a long
long time ago

772
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
long time ago
 

773
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,230
long time ago
i i experienced that but i thought it

774
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
i i experienced that but i thought it
 

775
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,110
i i experienced that but i thought it
would it was

776
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
would it was
 

777
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,150
would it was
fixed but i guess not

778
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
fixed but i guess not
 

779
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,870
fixed but i guess not
so i i i kind of think we can get a

780
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
so i i i kind of think we can get a
 

781
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,470
so i i i kind of think we can get a
village working and that's

782
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
village working and that's
 

783
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,870
village working and that's
our next goal here and we're going to

784
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
our next goal here and we're going to
 

785
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,870
our next goal here and we're going to
build the houses out of those clay

786
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
build the houses out of those clay
 

787
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,310

man this guy he is giving me trouble
somehow he found his way uh

1468
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
somehow he found his way uh
 

1469
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,869
somehow he found his way uh
i had like a one place i didn't have

1470
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:24,879
i had like a one place i didn't have
 

1471
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,149
i had like a one place i didn't have
sealed up

1472
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
sealed up
 

1473
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,669
sealed up
that he found and he ran into it first

1474
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
that he found and he ran into it first
 

1475
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,149
that he found and he ran into it first
thing he does jumps in fire

1476
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
thing he does jumps in fire
 

1477
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,629
thing he does jumps in fire
so i think he's almost dead already but

1478
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
so i think he's almost dead already but
 

1479
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,149
so i think he's almost dead already but
we'll get him there

1480
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
we'll get him there
 

1481
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,589
we'll get him there
um our goal basically is just to get one

1482
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
um our goal basically is just to get one
 

1483
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,069
um our goal basically is just to get one
one baby villager out of this guy and

1484
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
one baby villager out of this guy and
 

1485
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,030
one baby villager out of this guy and
that's all we need

1486
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040

 

1487
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,950

and if that works it's proof that you

1488
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
and if that works it's proof that you
 

1489
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,069
and if that works it's proof that you
can do a village

1490
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
can do a village
 

1491
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,430
can do a village
in the nether

1492
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440

 

1493
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,629

but this time

1494
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639

 

1495
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,069

let's be a little more careful

1496
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079

 

1497
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,230

it's all right he's fine it's fine we've

1498
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
it's all right he's fine it's fine we've
 

1499
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,710
it's all right he's fine it's fine we've
done this before

1500
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720

 

1501
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,550

there he is okay uh i want to get away

1502
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
there he is okay uh i want to get away
 

1503
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,829
there he is okay uh i want to get away
from that gas

1504
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839

 

1505
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,870

okay we have to get a bunch of doors in

1506
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
okay we have to get a bunch of doors in
 

1507
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,790
okay we have to get a bunch of doors in
this village for it to work

1508
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
this village for it to work
 

1509
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,710
this village for it to work
uh each door counts as

1510
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720
uh each door counts as
 

1511
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,550
uh each door counts as
every three doors basically counts as

1512
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
every three doors basically counts as
 

1513
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,310
every three doors basically counts as
one villager so i think we should get

1514
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
one villager so i think we should get
 

1515
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,470
one villager so i think we should get
nine in in this house just to see if

1516
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
nine in in this house just to see if
 

1517
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,230
nine in in this house just to see if
this works

1518
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
this works
 

1519
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,870
this works
and we'll take it from there

1520
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880

 

1521
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,030
