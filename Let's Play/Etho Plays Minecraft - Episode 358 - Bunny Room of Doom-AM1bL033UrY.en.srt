something I'll talk about later um we

320
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,300
something I'll talk about later um we
 

321
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,899
something I'll talk about later um we
want another dispenser I don't know if

322
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:41,909
want another dispenser I don't know if
 

323
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,610
want another dispenser I don't know if
I'm going to actually use this thing but

324
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm going to actually use this thing but
 

325
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,250
I'm going to actually use this thing but
it's actually let's put it on the other

326
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,260
it's actually let's put it on the other
 

327
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,350
it's actually let's put it on the other
side just to confuse myself a little bit

328
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,360
side just to confuse myself a little bit
 

329
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,620
side just to confuse myself a little bit
more this will be for poison potions

330
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:51,630
more this will be for poison potions
 

331
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,070
more this will be for poison potions
possibly possibly let's get some logs

332
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
possibly possibly let's get some logs
 

333
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,870
possibly possibly let's get some logs
going up all right like this and like

334
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
going up all right like this and like
 

335
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:14,780
going up all right like this and like
this okay behind there's so many pieces

336
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:14,790
this okay behind there's so many pieces
 

337
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,460
this okay behind there's so many pieces
to this it takes a long time to build

338
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,470
to this it takes a long time to build
 

339
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,840
to this it takes a long time to build
okay so behind here we're going to have

340
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:17,850
okay so behind here we're going to have
 

341
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,030
okay so behind here we're going to have
another dispenser in this will be a

342
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
another dispenser in this will be a
 

343
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,920
another dispenser in this will be a
water bucket and this is like an

344
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:21,930
water bucket and this is like an
 

345
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,250
water bucket and this is like an
optional auto kill system if we want to

346
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,260
optional auto kill system if we want to
 

347
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,010
optional auto kill system if we want to
use it get rid of that um and we're

348
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,020
use it get rid of that um and we're
 

349
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,230
use it get rid of that um and we're
going to need some fences let's try make

350
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,240
going to need some fences let's try make
 

351
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,270
going to need some fences let's try make
the new fences too so if you don't know

352
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,280
the new fences too so if you don't know
 

353
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,050
the new fences too so if you don't know
the recipe for arm I think it's like

354
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,060
the recipe for arm I think it's like
 

355
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,560
the recipe for arm I think it's like
this the recipe changed but need one

356
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:42,570
this the recipe changed but need one
 

357
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,280
this the recipe changed but need one
more block that's the wrong type there

358
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,290
more block that's the wrong type there
 

359
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,890
more block that's the wrong type there
we go just like this ah spruce fences

360
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:51,900
we go just like this ah spruce fences
 

361
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,949
we go just like this ah spruce fences
that is so cool you know if there's one

362
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
that is so cool you know if there's one
 

363
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,020
that is so cool you know if there's one
thing this game cannot have too much of

364
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,030
thing this game cannot have too much of
 

365
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,970
thing this game cannot have too much of
its new textures new types of blocks I

366
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:00,980
its new textures new types of blocks I
 

367
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,370
its new textures new types of blocks I
think we're gonna put it right let's

368
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,380
think we're gonna put it right let's
 

369
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,160
think we're gonna put it right let's
just break this right here like that and

370
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,170
just break this right here like that and
 

371
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,070
just break this right here like that and
the cool thing is as a 16 gets more and

372
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,080
the cool thing is as a 16 gets more and
 

373
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
the cool thing is as a 16 gets more and
more blocks

374
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,450
more blocks
 

375
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,870
more blocks
it doesn't just increase like the

376
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
it doesn't just increase like the
 

377
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,000
it doesn't just increase like the
combinations you can do lint linearly

378
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,010
combinations you can do lint linearly
 

379
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,110
combinations you can do lint linearly
it's exponentially because every new

380
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
it's exponentially because every new
 

381
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,430
it's exponentially because every new
block you can combine with all other

382
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,440
block you can combine with all other
 

383
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,350
block you can combine with all other
existing blocks right and as more and

384
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:26,360
existing blocks right and as more and
 

385
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,210
existing blocks right and as more and
more get added the number of

386
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,220
more get added the number of
 

387
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,150
more get added the number of
combinations increases exponentially

388
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
combinations increases exponentially
 

389
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,870
combinations increases exponentially
which is kind of cool I guess that means

390
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
which is kind of cool I guess that means
 

391
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,930
which is kind of cool I guess that means
your builds can be more and more unique

392
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:39,940

 

393
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,900

all right anyway

394
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:43,910

 

395
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,710

go up like this so the big rabbits those

396
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:47,720
go up like this so the big rabbits those
 

397
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,060
go up like this so the big rabbits those
guys down there they're going to sit on

398
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,070
guys down there they're going to sit on
 

399
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,630
guys down there they're going to sit on
top of this fence here actually we might

400
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
top of this fence here actually we might
 

401
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,570
top of this fence here actually we might
want to not put yeah I think this wants

402
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:55,580
want to not put yeah I think this wants
 

403
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,300
want to not put yeah I think this wants
to be glass so that's baby rabbits they

404
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,310
to be glass so that's baby rabbits they
 

405
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,800
to be glass so that's baby rabbits they
can fall through this little space on

406
00:10:59,800 --> 00:10:59,810
can fall through this little space on
 

407
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,510
can fall through this little space on
the left and the right of this and the

408
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:04,520
the left and the right of this and the
 

409
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,370
the left and the right of this and the
big ones cannot and we want it to go up

410
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:08,380
big ones cannot and we want it to go up
 

411
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,420
big ones cannot and we want it to go up
two blocks so that they'll try to jump

412
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,430
two blocks so that they'll try to jump
 

413
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,950
two blocks so that they'll try to jump
out of it even though that they can't

414
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:16,960
out of it even though that they can't
 

415
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,920
out of it even though that they can't
and I think that's pretty close to right

416
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:22,930
and I think that's pretty close to right
 

417
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:29,410
and I think that's pretty close to right
let's put two buttons over here and here

418
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:29,420
let's put two buttons over here and here
 

419
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,640
let's put two buttons over here and here
and we want the autocue button hooked up

420
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,650
and we want the autocue button hooked up
 

421
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,150
and we want the autocue button hooked up
so that is going to be right over here

422
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,160
so that is going to be right over here
 

423
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,830
so that is going to be right over here
just put a piece of redstone there so

424
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:38,840
just put a piece of redstone there so
 

425
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,520
just put a piece of redstone there so
this button goes to the dispenser click

426
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,530
this button goes to the dispenser click
 

427
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,170
this button goes to the dispenser click
it and that makes the water come out so

428
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,180
it and that makes the water come out so
 

429
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,760
it and that makes the water come out so
the baby rabbits when they sit on this

430
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:45,770
the baby rabbits when they sit on this
 

431
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,220
the baby rabbits when they sit on this
half slab they're going to be below the

432
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,230
half slab they're going to be below the
 

433
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,540
half slab they're going to be below the
water and then when they grow up their

434
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,550
water and then when they grow up their
 

435
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,310
water and then when they grow up their
heads are going to touch the water and

436
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:51,320
heads are going to touch the water and
 

437
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,670
heads are going to touch the water and
they'll they'll suffocate in it and then

438
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:54,680
they'll they'll suffocate in it and then
 

439
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,770
they'll they'll suffocate in it and then
all the drops fall on the half slab and

440
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:56,780
all the drops fall on the half slab and
 

441
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,720
all the drops fall on the half slab and
the hopper picks them up through the

442
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:58,730
the hopper picks them up through the
 

443
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,480
the hopper picks them up through the
half slab puts them in the chest

444
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,490
half slab puts them in the chest
 

445
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,070
half slab puts them in the chest
it's pretty good okay so I just did a

446
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,080
it's pretty good okay so I just did a
 

447
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,110
it's pretty good okay so I just did a
little bit off-camera here not too much

448
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120
little bit off-camera here not too much
 

449
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,470
little bit off-camera here not too much
I added in a button here for that piston

450
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,480
I added in a button here for that piston
 

451
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,380
I added in a button here for that piston
in the back so this is a this is a

452
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,390
in the back so this is a this is a
 

453
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,060
in the back so this is a this is a
release system if they're on the half

454
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,070
release system if they're on the half
 

455
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,060
release system if they're on the half
slab and you press this they fall down

456
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,070
slab and you press this they fall down
 

457
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,430
slab and you press this they fall down
and then they're free to get out if for

458
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
and then they're free to get out if for
 

459
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,400
and then they're free to get out if for
some reason you want them to roam free I

460
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,410
some reason you want them to roam free I
 

461
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,400
some reason you want them to roam free I
don't know

462
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,410
don't know
 

463
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,300
don't know
could come in handy and I was wondering

464
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,310
could come in handy and I was wondering
 

465
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,679
could come in handy and I was wondering
maybe we need to connect them to this

466
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:34,689
maybe we need to connect them to this
 

467
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,869
maybe we need to connect them to this
fence and we also need to be able to

468
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:36,879
fence and we also need to be able to
 

469
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,160
fence and we also need to be able to
feed them I'm wondering if we can use

470
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,170
feed them I'm wondering if we can use
 

471
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,790
feed them I'm wondering if we can use
half slabs or these snow slabs for five

472
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:41,800
half slabs or these snow slabs for five
 

473
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,710
half slabs or these snow slabs for five
six seven the bunnies are so small is

474
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
six seven the bunnies are so small is
 

475
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,170
six seven the bunnies are so small is
the thing at six layers they can get out

476
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,180
the thing at six layers they can get out
 

477
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,319
the thing at six layers they can get out
you need at least seven so there's like

478
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:52,329
you need at least seven so there's like
 

479
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,710
you need at least seven so there's like
just a tiny little gap there I'm

480
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:55,720
just a tiny little gap there I'm
 

481
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,850
just a tiny little gap there I'm
actually wondering why they don't get

482
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:56,860
actually wondering why they don't get
 

483
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,629
actually wondering why they don't get
out here because it seems like anyway I

484
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
out here because it seems like anyway I
 

485
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:10,019
out here because it seems like anyway I
don't know c-can we do that we can click

486
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:10,029
don't know c-can we do that we can click
 

487
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,540
don't know c-can we do that we can click
the fence pretty easy there oh now I'm

488
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:12,550
the fence pretty easy there oh now I'm
 

489
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,730
the fence pretty easy there oh now I'm
stuck all right we're going to try to

490
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:14,740
stuck all right we're going to try to
 

491
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,340
stuck all right we're going to try to
get a guy in there I don't think we can

492
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,350
get a guy in there I don't think we can
 

493
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,989
get a guy in there I don't think we can
feed them through that little tiny crack

494
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:18,999
feed them through that little tiny crack
 

495
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:24,720
feed them through that little tiny crack
though put some stairs here maybe we'll

496
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,730
though put some stairs here maybe we'll
 

497
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,540
though put some stairs here maybe we'll
block this too as we do this just so

498
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,550
block this too as we do this just so
 

499
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,980
block this too as we do this just so
they don't get stuck where I don't want

500
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:28,990
they don't get stuck where I don't want
 

501
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,790
they don't get stuck where I don't want
them to be all right so we got to get a

502
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
them to be all right so we got to get a
 

503
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,189
them to be all right so we got to get a
buddy up to the top there we only need a

504
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199
buddy up to the top there we only need a
 

505
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,699
buddy up to the top there we only need a
few breeding bunnies and the thing is if

few breeding bunnies and the thing is if
 

507
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,740
few breeding bunnies and the thing is if
you don't have them connect it to the

508
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,750
you don't have them connect it to the
 

509
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,639
you don't have them connect it to the
fence they are free to teleport to you

510
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:43,649
fence they are free to teleport to you
 

511
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,619

whenever you relog they stop jumping and
 

589
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,770
whenever you relog they stop jumping and

being squished into the corner or
 

603
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,350

something it's good if they're jumping
 

605
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,690
something it's good if they're jumping
because it'll be easier to feed them

606
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:40,700
because it'll be easier to feed them
 

607
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,700
because it'll be easier to feed them
otherwise it'll always try to like feed
