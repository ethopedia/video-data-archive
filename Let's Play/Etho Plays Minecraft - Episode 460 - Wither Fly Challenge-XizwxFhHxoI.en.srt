00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,270
I've been working on the nether wart
 

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,980
I've been working on the nether wart

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
new blocks the nether warts the red
 

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,910
new blocks the nether warts the red
nether wart bricks and the magma and the

16
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:28,920
nether wart bricks and the magma and the
 

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,189
nether wart bricks and the magma and the
other nether wart blocks but now that

18
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
other nether wart blocks but now that
 

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,600
other nether wart blocks but now that
I've actually used them and see them

20
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:32,610
I've actually used them and see them
 

21
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,840
I've actually used them and see them
here I really really liked it and I was

that I was having so much trouble making
 

27
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,240
that I was having so much trouble making
these magma blocks like the make using

28
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,250
these magma blocks like the make using
 

29
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,380
these magma blocks like the make using
the magma cream is a little bit

30
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,390
the magma cream is a little bit
 

31
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,330
the magma cream is a little bit
expensive and then I saw you guys

32
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340
expensive and then I saw you guys
 

33
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,970
expensive and then I saw you guys
comments it's like oh yeah you can find

comments it's like oh yeah you can find
 

35
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,029
comments it's like oh yeah you can find
it in the nether can't you so I went to

36
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
it in the nether can't you so I went to
 

37
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,500
it in the nether can't you so I went to
the nether I grabbed a whole bunch of it

38
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:51,510
the nether I grabbed a whole bunch of it
 

39
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,209
the nether I grabbed a whole bunch of it
and yeah we didn't use it a lot in

40
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:53,219
and yeah we didn't use it a lot in
 

41
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,250
and yeah we didn't use it a lot in
building cuz it's actually very abundant

42
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
building cuz it's actually very abundant
 

43
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,330
building cuz it's actually very abundant
in the nether I was surprised yeah

44
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,340
in the nether I was surprised yeah
 

45
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,650
in the nether I was surprised yeah
pretty much got the whole thing done

46
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,660
pretty much got the whole thing done
 

47
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,590
pretty much got the whole thing done
here in the middle I decided to just do

48
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
here in the middle I decided to just do
 

49
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,230
here in the middle I decided to just do
like a ring of magma around there try it

50
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
like a ring of magma around there try it
 

51
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,630
like a ring of magma around there try it
immediately it connects to the skylight

52
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
immediately it connects to the skylight
 

53
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,000
immediately it connects to the skylight
we got in the middle here as well and I

54
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,010
we got in the middle here as well and I
 

55
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,300
we got in the middle here as well and I
had to hang some lights for each of

56
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,310
had to hang some lights for each of
 

57
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,910
had to hang some lights for each of
these sections here just so the nether

58
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
these sections here just so the nether
 

59
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,370
these sections here just so the nether
wart wasn't totally dark so I got some

60
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,380
wart wasn't totally dark so I got some
 

61
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,039
wart wasn't totally dark so I got some
hanging lights going on and I did the

62
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,049
hanging lights going on and I did the
 

63
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,219
hanging lights going on and I did the
thing where you put glowstone right next

64
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:25,229
thing where you put glowstone right next
 

65
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,530
thing where you put glowstone right next
to the magma blocks and then they retain

66
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,540
to the magma blocks and then they retain
 

67
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,800
to the magma blocks and then they retain
the light from the glowstone so actually

68
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:30,810
the light from the glowstone so actually
 

69
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,929
the light from the glowstone so actually
even though it looks pretty dark in here

70
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
even though it looks pretty dark in here
 

71
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,749
even though it looks pretty dark in here
this is a bit of a darker theme right if

72
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
this is a bit of a darker theme right if
 

73
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,039
this is a bit of a darker theme right if
we look at our lighting levels this is

74
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,049
we look at our lighting levels this is
 

75
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,289
we look at our lighting levels this is
actually totally lit up like nowheres

76
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:39,299
actually totally lit up like nowheres
 

77
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,230
actually totally lit up like nowheres
does it drop the light level 7 where

78
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
does it drop the light level 7 where
 

79
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,050
does it drop the light level 7 where
we're standing here so that is pretty

80
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
we're standing here so that is pretty
 

81
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,020
we're standing here so that is pretty
cool we're not gonna get any mom spawns

82
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,030
cool we're not gonna get any mom spawns
 

83
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,710
cool we're not gonna get any mom spawns
on the grass here or anything yeah let's

84
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720
on the grass here or anything yeah let's
 

85
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,200
on the grass here or anything yeah let's
try this out now right let's let's

86
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,210
try this out now right let's let's
 

87
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,280
try this out now right let's let's
activate this I haven't done that yet so

88
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,290
activate this I haven't done that yet so
 

89
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,590
activate this I haven't done that yet so
here we go press the button see if any

90
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
here we go press the button see if any
 

91
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,020
here we go press the button see if any
wash up on the sides now that I raised

92
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
wash up on the sides now that I raised
 

93
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,649
wash up on the sides now that I raised
the size a little bit as well good looks

94
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:06,659
the size a little bit as well good looks
 

95
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,150
the size a little bit as well good looks
like everything's getting washed in the

96
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
like everything's getting washed in the
 

97
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,940
like everything's getting washed in the
middle it does take it a long time

98
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:10,950
middle it does take it a long time
 

99
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,040
middle it does take it a long time
though right because it's on slow sand

100
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,050
though right because it's on slow sand
 

101
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,670
though right because it's on slow sand
so I think the items move slower right

102
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:18,680
so I think the items move slower right
 

103
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,640
so I think the items move slower right
that seems pretty slow like the wins way

104
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,650
that seems pretty slow like the wins way
 

105
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,080
that seems pretty slow like the wins way
in the back there still haven't made it

106
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,090
in the back there still haven't made it
 

107
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,190
in the back there still haven't made it
yet so we're gonna have to leave the

108
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
yet so we're gonna have to leave the
 

109
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
yet so we're gonna have to leave the
water running for quite a while whenever

110
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:26,730
water running for quite a while whenever
 

111
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,920
water running for quite a while whenever
we do a harvest here but yeah it looks

112
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:30,930
we do a harvest here but yeah it looks
 

113
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,360
we do a harvest here but yeah it looks
like it's gonna work pretty good

114
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,370
like it's gonna work pretty good
 

115
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,790
like it's gonna work pretty good

yeah it takes a really long time then
 

125
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,790
yeah it takes a really long time then
still don't have a collection system set

126
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
still don't have a collection system set
 

127
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,610
still don't have a collection system set
up we might do that today among other

128
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
up we might do that today among other
 

129
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,030
up we might do that today among other
things here now we're gonna do a quick

130
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
things here now we're gonna do a quick
 

131
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,380
things here now we're gonna do a quick
little test here just to see the

132
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,390
little test here just to see the
 

133
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,390
little test here just to see the
difference it actually makes I got soul

134
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
difference it actually makes I got soul
 

135
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,730
difference it actually makes I got soul
sand on one side dirt on the other water

136
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:58,740
sand on one side dirt on the other water
 

137
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,190
sand on one side dirt on the other water
in the middle so they should go at the

138
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
in the middle so they should go at the
 

139
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,730
in the middle so they should go at the
city exact same time as each other and

140
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:03,740
city exact same time as each other and
 

141
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,170
city exact same time as each other and
dirt is done and soul sand so sand is

142
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,180
dirt is done and soul sand so sand is
 

143
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,960
dirt is done and soul sand so sand is
done so yeah that's that's quite a bit

144
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:11,970
done so yeah that's that's quite a bit
 

145
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,910
done so yeah that's that's quite a bit
slower for sure okay guys so I want to

146
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
slower for sure okay guys so I want to
 

147
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,620
slower for sure okay guys so I want to
set up a hopper clock for our water

148
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,630
set up a hopper clock for our water
 

149
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,960
set up a hopper clock for our water
stream thing here because as it is right

150

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,470
use a hopper clock we just have to press
this button once it'll time how long to

162
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
this button once it'll time how long to
 

163
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,840
this button once it'll time how long to
keep the water on for and then shut it

164
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:35,850
keep the water on for and then shut it
 

165
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,550
keep the water on for and then shut it
off automatically so it's a little bit

166
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,560
off automatically so it's a little bit
 

167
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,460
off automatically so it's a little bit
cooler a little bit easier and usually I

168
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:40,470
cooler a little bit easier and usually I
 

169
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,980
cooler a little bit easier and usually I
would just do this off-camera but I want

170
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:42,990
would just do this off-camera but I want
 

171
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,660
would just do this off-camera but I want

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:51,810
of these and you've used them before
 

179
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,020
of these and you've used them before
there's a chance you don't know how to

180
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,030
there's a chance you don't know how to
 

181
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,750
there's a chance you don't know how to
use them to their full potential because

00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
use them to their full potential because
 

183
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
use them to their full potential because
by making a couple little adjustments

184
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:58,650
by making a couple little adjustments
 

185
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,730
by making a couple little adjustments
you can actually change what it does

186
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:00,740
you can actually change what it does
 

187
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,930
you can actually change what it does
significantly I'll just show you that

188
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:02,940
significantly I'll just show you that
 

189

design here with using two sticky

192
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:08,850
design here with using two sticky
 

193
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,600
design here with using two sticky
pistons redstone dust over there and

194
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,610
pistons redstone dust over there and
 

195
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,130
pistons redstone dust over there and
there and then depending on how many

196
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,140
there and then depending on how many
 

197
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,810
there and then depending on how many
items you put in the hoppers here it

198
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:14,820
items you put in the hoppers here it
 

199
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,080
items you put in the hoppers here it
affects how long the timing is so right

200
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,090
affects how long the timing is so right
 

201
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,440
affects how long the timing is so right
now it's gonna bounce back and forth so

202
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,450
now it's gonna bounce back and forth so
 

203
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,680
now it's gonna bounce back and forth so
it's like a repeating timer it doesn't

204
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:24,690
it's like a repeating timer it doesn't
 

205
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,240
it's like a repeating timer it doesn't
stop if you want to stop it you can

206
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,250
stop if you want to stop it you can
 

207
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,960
stop if you want to stop it you can
power you

208
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:26,970
power you
 

209
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,180
power you
redstone dust the pistons the hoppers

210
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
redstone dust the pistons the hoppers
 

211
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,820
redstone dust the pistons the hoppers
the block here there's a lot of

212
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:31,830
the block here there's a lot of
 

213
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,590
the block here there's a lot of
different ways you can shut it off

214
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
different ways you can shut it off
 

215
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,400
different ways you can shut it off
and you see it stopped until you release

216
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,410
and you see it stopped until you release
 

217
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,730
and you see it stopped until you release
that again that's pretty cool now most

218
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:40,740
that again that's pretty cool now most
 

219
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,350
that again that's pretty cool now most
the time though you only want it to go

220
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
the time though you only want it to go
 

221
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,950
the time though you only want it to go
once you don't want it to continue going

222
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
once you don't want it to continue going
 

223
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,860
once you don't want it to continue going
so you can make it work with just the

224
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:48,870
so you can make it work with just the
 

225
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,470
so you can make it work with just the
redstone pulse like this switch one of

226
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,480
redstone pulse like this switch one of
 

227
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,060
redstone pulse like this switch one of
the sticky pistons to a regular piston

228
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,070
the sticky pistons to a regular piston
 

229
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,620
the sticky pistons to a regular piston
and then like if you send a redstone

230
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,630
and then like if you send a redstone
 

231
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,620
and then like if you send a redstone
pulse over there it'll go once bounce

232
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,630
pulse over there it'll go once bounce
 

233
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,460
pulse over there it'll go once bounce
back and then it'll stop right that's

234
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,470
back and then it'll stop right that's
 

235
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,350
back and then it'll stop right that's
pretty cool

236
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
pretty cool
 

237
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,350
pretty cool
now you can get oh yeah also they're

238
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
now you can get oh yeah also they're
 

239
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,350
now you can get oh yeah also they're
affected by block updates as you saw

240
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
affected by block updates as you saw
 

241
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,480
affected by block updates as you saw
there so because I broke the redstone

242
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,490
there so because I broke the redstone
 

243
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,010
there so because I broke the redstone
dust it activated it one way you can get

244
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,020
dust it activated it one way you can get
 

245
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
dust it activated it one way you can get
the power out is to put like a repeater

246
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,030
the power out is to put like a repeater
 

247
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,280
the power out is to put like a repeater
here and then when the block goes

248
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,290
here and then when the block goes
 

249
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,560
here and then when the block goes
forward it'll send the signal to that

250
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,570
forward it'll send the signal to that
 

251
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,620
forward it'll send the signal to that
but also if you put a repeater on the

252
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,630
but also if you put a repeater on the
 

253
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,080
but also if you put a repeater on the
side with the regular piston on the

254
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,090
side with the regular piston on the
 

255
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,880
side with the regular piston on the
block here look at the difference that

256
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:31,890
block here look at the difference that
 

257
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,170
block here look at the difference that
does so you notice how long that one's

258
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:36,180
does so you notice how long that one's
 

259
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,300
does so you notice how long that one's
on compared to this one this one stays

260
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,310
on compared to this one this one stays
 

261
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,760
on compared to this one this one stays
on for the full cycle so that if you

262
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:40,770
on for the full cycle so that if you
 

263
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,409
on for the full cycle so that if you
want to use it again right afterwards

264
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:42,419
want to use it again right afterwards
 

265
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,750
want to use it again right afterwards
you can if you're getting the power out

266
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:44,760
you can if you're getting the power out
 

267
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,250
you can if you're getting the power out
from here and art for our case here

268
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,260
from here and art for our case here
 

269
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,140
from here and art for our case here
because I want to turn the water on and

270
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,150
because I want to turn the water on and
 

271
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,240
because I want to turn the water on and
then off afterwards

272
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,250
then off afterwards
 

273
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,820
then off afterwards
two pulses what you can do is just put

274
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:58,830
two pulses what you can do is just put
 

275
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,880
two pulses what you can do is just put
two redstone dust like that and then

276
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:01,890
two redstone dust like that and then
 

277
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,500
two redstone dust like that and then
when it cycles back and forth you see

278
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,510
when it cycles back and forth you see
 

279
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,409
when it cycles back and forth you see
how it goes off and on so that's pretty

280
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
how it goes off and on so that's pretty
 

281
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,670
how it goes off and on so that's pretty
much all we got to do here and I figured

282
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,680
much all we got to do here and I figured
 

283
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,350
much all we got to do here and I figured
it's probably about two stacks of items

284
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
it's probably about two stacks of items
 

285
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,110
it's probably about two stacks of items
we have to put in here let's just try

286
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
we have to put in here let's just try
 

287
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,100
we have to put in here let's just try
this out for now shut off good and it's

288
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,110
this out for now shut off good and it's
 

289
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,170
this out for now shut off good and it's
done yeah so it only goes once and it

290
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,180
done yeah so it only goes once and it
 

291
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,920
done yeah so it only goes once and it
sends a double pulse on the output

292
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:29,930

 

293
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,360

cool cool so that seems to be working

294
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,370
cool cool so that seems to be working
 

295
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,640
cool cool so that seems to be working
pretty good now let's figure out how

296
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,650
pretty good now let's figure out how
 

297
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,680
pretty good now let's figure out how
we're gonna extend this room because as

298
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:38,690
we're gonna extend this room because as
 

299
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,749
we're gonna extend this room because as
it is right now there's actually no

300
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:40,759
it is right now there's actually no
 

301
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,480
it is right now there's actually no
proper entrance or exit or connection to

302
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,490
proper entrance or exit or connection to
 

303
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,600
proper entrance or exit or connection to
the man cave

304
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:45,610
the man cave
 

305
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,529
the man cave
creeper found me all right which way

306
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:49,539
creeper found me all right which way
 

307
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,890
creeper found me all right which way
where did we as are here yeah okay so

308
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:52,900
where did we as are here yeah okay so
 

309
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,490
where did we as are here yeah okay so
this is the closest side to the stuff we

310
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:57,500
this is the closest side to the stuff we
 

311
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,620
this is the closest side to the stuff we
got built over there so maybe we put the

312
00:06:59,620 --> 00:06:59,630
got built over there so maybe we put the
 

313
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,969
got built over there so maybe we put the
entrance over on this side then let's

314
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:03,979
entrance over on this side then let's
 

315
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,070
entrance over on this side then let's
see if let's see what happens if we dig

316
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
see if let's see what happens if we dig
 

317
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,900
see if let's see what happens if we dig
this way and go down a little bit if it

318
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:07,910
this way and go down a little bit if it
 

319
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,700
this way and go down a little bit if it
will connect to the man cave because I

320
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,710
will connect to the man cave because I
 

321
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,430
will connect to the man cave because I
think it's supposed to yeah let's get

322
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:12,440
think it's supposed to yeah let's get
 

323
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,469
think it's supposed to yeah let's get
some torches going to or do well do a

324
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
some torches going to or do well do a
 

325
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,480
some torches going to or do well do a
little bit of planning here what what

326
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,490
little bit of planning here what what
 

327
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,100
little bit of planning here what what
paths we're gonna take is this something

328
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,110
paths we're gonna take is this something
 

329
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,060
paths we're gonna take is this something
I built yeah its first wood I was right

330
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,070
I built yeah its first wood I was right
 

331
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,230
I built yeah its first wood I was right
here oh man that was a lot closer than I

332
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
here oh man that was a lot closer than I
 

333
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,110
here oh man that was a lot closer than I
expected actually

334
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
expected actually
 

335
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,370
expected actually
maybe we don't want to go here then

336
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,380
maybe we don't want to go here then
 

337
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,570
maybe we don't want to go here then
maybe we should take one of the other

338
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,580
maybe we should take one of the other
 

339
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,710
maybe we should take one of the other
sides because they're a little bit

340
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
sides because they're a little bit
 

341
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,250
sides because they're a little bit
farther away yeah we'll be able to do a

342
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:36,260
farther away yeah we'll be able to do a
 

343
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
farther away yeah we'll be able to do a
better transition maybe if we pick that

344
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,270
better transition maybe if we pick that
 

345
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:45,219
better transition maybe if we pick that
side over there for our path man I just

346
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:45,229
side over there for our path man I just
 

347
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,080
side over there for our path man I just
found the light level 7 spot I've been

348
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,090
found the light level 7 spot I've been
 

349
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,610
found the light level 7 spot I've been
noticing we've been getting like

350
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,620
noticing we've been getting like
 

351
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
noticing we've been getting like
creepers and skeletons spotting in here

352
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:50,630
creepers and skeletons spotting in here
 

353
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,050
creepers and skeletons spotting in here
and I decided to check it out and yeah

354
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,060
and I decided to check it out and yeah
 

355
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,350
and I decided to check it out and yeah
it looks like there's actually a few of

356
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,360
it looks like there's actually a few of
 

357
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,700
it looks like there's actually a few of
them there's one here there's one here

358
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,710
them there's one here there's one here
 

359
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,810
them there's one here there's one here
one over here do they go all the way

360
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:01,820
one over here do they go all the way
 

361
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,790
one over here do they go all the way
down this spot over here seems fine it's

362
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
down this spot over here seems fine it's
 

363
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,879
down this spot over here seems fine it's
it's more over here I guess oh how do we

364
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:09,889
it's more over here I guess oh how do we
 

365
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,850
it's more over here I guess oh how do we
deal with this we'd either have to put

366
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:12,860
deal with this we'd either have to put
 

367
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,570
deal with this we'd either have to put
like a light over here or maybe what

368
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:16,580
like a light over here or maybe what
 

369
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,990
like a light over here or maybe what
happens if we lower this one more does

370
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
happens if we lower this one more does
 

371
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,850
happens if we lower this one more does
that solve the problem oh I think I got

372
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:24,860
that solve the problem oh I think I got
 

373
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,290
that solve the problem oh I think I got
rid of a few of them but yeah there's

374
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:26,300
rid of a few of them but yeah there's
 

375
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,379
rid of a few of them but yeah there's
still one one or two here I'll have to

376
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:29,389
still one one or two here I'll have to
 

377
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,050
still one one or two here I'll have to
think about that I guess I thought we

378
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,060
think about that I guess I thought we
 

379
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,209
think about that I guess I thought we
were all good but now we're getting an

380
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:34,219
were all good but now we're getting an
 

381
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,360
were all good but now we're getting an
Enderman down here but yeah here's the

382
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,370
Enderman down here but yeah here's the
 

383
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,870
Enderman down here but yeah here's the
plan

384
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:37,880
plan
 

385
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,719
plan
I decided let's make a fairly big room

386
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:40,729
I decided let's make a fairly big room
 

387
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,579
I decided let's make a fairly big room
over here this is where we're gonna

388
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:42,589
over here this is where we're gonna
 

389
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,399
over here this is where we're gonna
actually

390
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:43,409
actually
 

391
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,769
actually
like store the netherwart in chests that

392
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:45,779
like store the netherwart in chests that
 

393
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,439
like store the netherwart in chests that
we get from the farm here so we're gonna

394
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:48,449
we get from the farm here so we're gonna
 

395
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,269
we get from the farm here so we're gonna
make the ice-cream go off this direction

396
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:50,279
make the ice-cream go off this direction
 

397
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,009
make the ice-cream go off this direction
this is where we'll have the button to

398
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,019
this is where we'll have the button to
 

399
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,800
this is where we'll have the button to
harvest the crops and that kind of thing

400
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:54,810
harvest the crops and that kind of thing
 

401
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,189
harvest the crops and that kind of thing
crops I mean in other words and then off

402
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:58,199
crops I mean in other words and then off
 

403
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,689
crops I mean in other words and then off
on this side is where we're gonna

404
00:08:59,689 --> 00:08:59,699
on this side is where we're gonna
 

405
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,819
on this side is where we're gonna
connect to the man cave so I been

406
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:01,829
connect to the man cave so I been
 

407
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,730
connect to the man cave so I been
experimenting here with the tunnel I'm

408
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:04,740
experimenting here with the tunnel I'm
 

409
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,519
experimenting here with the tunnel I'm
not quite sold on it just yet it's a

410
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:07,529
not quite sold on it just yet it's a
 

411
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,860
not quite sold on it just yet it's a
little bit on the plain side but yeah

412
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:09,870
little bit on the plain side but yeah
 

413
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,929
little bit on the plain side but yeah
basically it's gonna come down to over

414
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:11,939
basically it's gonna come down to over
 

415
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:15,170
basically it's gonna come down to over
here and I tried to line it up with the

416
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,180
here and I tried to line it up with the
 

417
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
here and I tried to line it up with the
staircase so we'll be able to go

418
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,250
staircase so we'll be able to go
 

419
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,309
staircase so we'll be able to go
straight through here and we'll also

420
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:19,319
straight through here and we'll also
 

421
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:22,129
straight through here and we'll also
want to probably refine this area a bit

422
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:22,139
want to probably refine this area a bit
 

423
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,740
want to probably refine this area a bit
better and he'll go up and to the right

424
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:24,750
better and he'll go up and to the right
 

425
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,069
better and he'll go up and to the right
here I think is pretty good and then oh

426
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:28,079
here I think is pretty good and then oh
 

427
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,139
here I think is pretty good and then oh
yeah people are telling me I should

428
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:30,149
yeah people are telling me I should
 

429
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,090
yeah people are telling me I should
build a bridge across the netherwart

430
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,100
build a bridge across the netherwart
 

431
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,800
build a bridge across the netherwart
here I thought about doing that but

432
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:33,810
here I thought about doing that but
 

433
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,230
here I thought about doing that but
maybe I just got to get better at the

434
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
maybe I just got to get better at the
 

435
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,280
maybe I just got to get better at the
bow jump because that works too and then

436
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,290
bow jump because that works too and then
 

437
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,019
bow jump because that works too and then
off on this side I'm thinking about

438
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,029
off on this side I'm thinking about
 

439
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,809
off on this side I'm thinking about
going up to the surface then have a way

440
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:44,819
going up to the surface then have a way
 

441
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,720
going up to the surface then have a way
out over here it does go right next to

442
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:47,730
out over here it does go right next to
 

443
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,309
out over here it does go right next to
the beacon we got set up though so I'll

444
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:49,319
the beacon we got set up though so I'll
 

445
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:52,280
the beacon we got set up though so I'll
have to move that first now in there's a

446
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,290
have to move that first now in there's a
 

447
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,720
have to move that first now in there's a
little blocks I hate you so much

448
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:53,730
little blocks I hate you so much
 

449
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,769
little blocks I hate you so much
everybody hates you here let's let's

450
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:57,779
everybody hates you here let's let's
 

451
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,980
everybody hates you here let's let's
start doing the ice cream though so

452
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:00,990
start doing the ice cream though so
 

453
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,530
start doing the ice cream though so
basically okay that's that's the spider

454
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:06,540
basically okay that's that's the spider
 

455
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,300
basically okay that's that's the spider
farm over there basically what we're

456
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,310
farm over there basically what we're
 

457
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,100
farm over there basically what we're
gonna do is have packed ice running this

458
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,110
gonna do is have packed ice running this
 

459
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,009
gonna do is have packed ice running this
way and then it'll eventually go to an

460
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:13,019
way and then it'll eventually go to an
 

461
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,309
way and then it'll eventually go to an
item elevator and hop into chess and we

462
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:16,319
item elevator and hop into chess and we
 

463
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,949
item elevator and hop into chess and we
might also want to sort the nether work

464
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
might also want to sort the nether work
 

465
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,170
might also want to sort the nether work
just in case other items get mixed in

466
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,180
just in case other items get mixed in
 

467
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:31,820
just in case other items get mixed in
with it

468
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:31,830

 

469
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,100

could you can cream ice cream ha ha okay

470
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,110
could you can cream ice cream ha ha okay
 

471
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,510
could you can cream ice cream ha ha okay
guys so we're gonna take a little break

472
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:39,520
guys so we're gonna take a little break
 

473
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,920
guys so we're gonna take a little break
from the building get a change of

474
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:40,930
from the building get a change of
 

475
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,100
from the building get a change of
scenery here and I have an idea for a

476
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,110

don't think I'm gonna be able to get him

636
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,090
don't think I'm gonna be able to get him
 

637
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,550
don't think I'm gonna be able to get him
out of there if I don't get him out of

638
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
out of there if I don't get him out of
 

639
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,710
out of there if I don't get him out of
there it's over oh I was a big mistake

640
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
there it's over oh I was a big mistake
 

641
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,760
there it's over oh I was a big mistake
oh okay I'm bailing I'm bailing yeah I

642
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:47,770
oh okay I'm bailing I'm bailing yeah I
 

643
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,520
oh okay I'm bailing I'm bailing yeah I
failed it was a good attempt I need more

644
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:50,530
failed it was a good attempt I need more
 

645
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,950
failed it was a good attempt I need more
strength potions of to finish it I think

646
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:52,960
strength potions of to finish it I think
 

647
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,620
strength potions of to finish it I think
and a better location okay guys so we

648
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,630
and a better location okay guys so we
 

649
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,360
and a better location okay guys so we
are back at the nether wart farm now

650
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,370
are back at the nether wart farm now
 

651
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,720
are back at the nether wart farm now
doing some things here I think I solved

652
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:03,730
doing some things here I think I solved
 

653
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,880
doing some things here I think I solved
the lighting issue we were having kind

654
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:05,890
the lighting issue we were having kind
 

655
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,130
the lighting issue we were having kind
of maybe but not really

656
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,140
of maybe but not really
 

657
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,290
of maybe but not really
I've seen some rumors in my comments

658
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:10,300
I've seen some rumors in my comments
 

659
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,390
I've seen some rumors in my comments
that these magma blocks are a little bit

660
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:12,400
that these magma blocks are a little bit
 

661
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,080
that these magma blocks are a little bit
glitchy at the moment so you'll see the

662
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,090
glitchy at the moment so you'll see the
 

663
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,920
glitchy at the moment so you'll see the
light level says 9 8 and 9 and I'm

664
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:19,930
light level says 9 8 and 9 and I'm
 

665
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,420
light level says 9 8 and 9 and I'm
almost certain it was higher than that

666
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,430
almost certain it was higher than that
 

667
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,090
almost certain it was higher than that
before I saw people were saying when you

668
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,100
before I saw people were saying when you
 

669
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,730
before I saw people were saying when you
leave the chunk it resets or something I

670
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:26,740
leave the chunk it resets or something I
 

671
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,820
leave the chunk it resets or something I
don't know how much truth is to that so

672
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:29,830
don't know how much truth is to that so
 

673
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,150
don't know how much truth is to that so
now it's 13 all the way down and that

674
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,160
now it's 13 all the way down and that
 

675
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,070
now it's 13 all the way down and that
gets rid of the light level 7 problem we

676
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,080
gets rid of the light level 7 problem we
 

677
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,990
gets rid of the light level 7 problem we
had also I added a little bit of a face

678
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
had also I added a little bit of a face
 

679
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,910
had also I added a little bit of a face
plate here on the end of of all of these

680
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
plate here on the end of of all of these
 

681
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,180
plate here on the end of of all of these
I think that looks kind of ok breaks it

682
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,190
I think that looks kind of ok breaks it
 

683
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,210
I think that looks kind of ok breaks it
up a bit more mmm yeah something very

684
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,220
up a bit more mmm yeah something very
 

685
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,580
up a bit more mmm yeah something very
strange is happening for sure I left the

686
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:50,590
strange is happening for sure I left the
 

687
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,590
strange is happening for sure I left the
area and came back like I let the chunks

688
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,600
area and came back like I let the chunks
 

689
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,230
area and came back like I let the chunks
unload it still says 13 here where we

690
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,240
unload it still says 13 here where we
 

691
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,510
unload it still says 13 here where we
just updated but a lot of these other

692
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:57,520
just updated but a lot of these other
 

693
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,900
just updated but a lot of these other
ones either overtime or whatever have

694
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:00,910
ones either overtime or whatever have
 

695
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,720
ones either overtime or whatever have
have lowered in light level so maybe

696
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:03,730
have lowered in light level so maybe
 

697
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,610
have lowered in light level so maybe
when they receive a block update maybe

698
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:05,620
when they receive a block update maybe
 

699
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,040
when they receive a block update maybe
it decreases I don't know this is my yes

700
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,050
it decreases I don't know this is my yes
 

701
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,600
it decreases I don't know this is my yes
and like like updating the lighting

702
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:12,610
and like like updating the lighting
 

703
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,980
and like like updating the lighting
around here isn't changing it either

704
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:13,990
around here isn't changing it either
 

705
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,850
around here isn't changing it either
it's not lowering it so I don't know

706
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:16,860
it's not lowering it so I don't know
 

707
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,520
it's not lowering it so I don't know
something very strange though for sure

708
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,530
something very strange though for sure
 

709
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,900
something very strange though for sure
anyways worst case scenario we'll just

710
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:21,910
anyways worst case scenario we'll just
 

711
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,740
anyways worst case scenario we'll just
put a little stone

712
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:22,750
put a little stone
 

713
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,480
put a little stone
glowstone on the opposite side of the

714
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,490
glowstone on the opposite side of the
 

715
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,370
glowstone on the opposite side of the
magma block and that should fix it long

716
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:26,380
magma block and that should fix it long
 

717
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,820
magma block and that should fix it long
term over here I did set up the item

718
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:29,830
term over here I did set up the item
 

719
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,220
term over here I did set up the item
elevator for the nether warts so

720
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,230
elevator for the nether warts so
 

721
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,919
elevator for the nether warts so
basically we got the water stream and we

722
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:37,929
basically we got the water stream and we
 

723
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,650
basically we got the water stream and we
just thought we fell down

724
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:39,660
just thought we fell down
 

725
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,159
just thought we fell down
we fell down can't see anything now okay

726
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:43,169
we fell down can't see anything now okay
 

727
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,970
we fell down can't see anything now okay
we back up good yeah the water streams

728
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:46,980
we back up good yeah the water streams
 

729
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,220
we back up good yeah the water streams
over there so it's bringing all the

730
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,230
over there so it's bringing all the
 

731
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,020
over there so it's bringing all the
nether words to the very end here into a

732
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,030
nether words to the very end here into a
 

733
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,190
nether words to the very end here into a
hopper into the item elevator just using

734
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
hopper into the item elevator just using
 

735
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,580
hopper into the item elevator just using
droppers we got a little clock system

736
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,590
droppers we got a little clock system
 

737
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,320
droppers we got a little clock system
that detects if there's items in there

738
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,330
that detects if there's items in there
 

739
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,080
that detects if there's items in there
and then ever it runs and staircases up

740
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,090
and then ever it runs and staircases up
 

741
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,380
and then ever it runs and staircases up
to each of the droppers and lets go back

742
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,390
to each of the droppers and lets go back
 

743
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,220
to each of the droppers and lets go back
up so now if we activate the farm it

744
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,230
up so now if we activate the farm it
 

745
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,630
up so now if we activate the farm it
should shoot a bunch of nether word out

746
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:11,640
should shoot a bunch of nether word out
 

747
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,560
should shoot a bunch of nether word out
of the top here

748
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,570
of the top here
 

749
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,680
of the top here
oh yeah and to activate it I think what

750
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:15,690
oh yeah and to activate it I think what
 

751
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,700
oh yeah and to activate it I think what
we'll do is maybe put a button right on

752
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:19,710
we'll do is maybe put a button right on
 

753
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,110
we'll do is maybe put a button right on
these droppers yeah let's do that

754
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,120
these droppers yeah let's do that
 

755
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,799
these droppers yeah let's do that
we'll do a wooden button maybe right

756
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:27,809
we'll do a wooden button maybe right
 

757
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,930
we'll do a wooden button maybe right
over here shouldn't interfere with

758
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:29,940
over here shouldn't interfere with
 

759
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,159
over here shouldn't interfere with
anything else besides the item elevator

760
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:33,169
anything else besides the item elevator
 

761
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,140
anything else besides the item elevator
yeah we'll do that and then let's run

762
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,150
yeah we'll do that and then let's run
 

763
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,470
yeah we'll do that and then let's run
this over so that I'll go to the the

764
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:39,480
this over so that I'll go to the the
 

765
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,730
this over so that I'll go to the the
hopper clock there and I think I got the

766
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:43,740
hopper clock there and I think I got the
 

767
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,500
hopper clock there and I think I got the
right timing on the water now ah that

768
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,510
right timing on the water now ah that
 

769
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,149
right timing on the water now ah that
looks so cool when I harvest some it I

770
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:50,159
looks so cool when I harvest some it I
 

771
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,940
looks so cool when I harvest some it I
really like that they like the nether or

772
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:52,950
really like that they like the nether or
 

773
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,980
really like that they like the nether or
kind of jumps along as it goes looks

774
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:54,990
kind of jumps along as it goes looks
 

775
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,130
kind of jumps along as it goes looks
neat okay and then from the top here

776
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,140
neat okay and then from the top here
 

777
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,960
neat okay and then from the top here
we're probably gonna run some more

778
00:18:59,960 --> 00:18:59,970
we're probably gonna run some more
 

779
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,029
we're probably gonna run some more
hoppers over to the other side here and

780
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
hoppers over to the other side here and
 

781
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,970
hoppers over to the other side here and
then into some chess so maybe one two

782
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:04,980
then into some chess so maybe one two
 

783
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,549
then into some chess so maybe one two
three four five six seven how far off

784
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
three four five six seven how far off
 

785
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,279
three four five six seven how far off
how far away do we want to go with this

786
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:12,289
how far away do we want to go with this
 

787
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:18,409
how far away do we want to go with this
maybe just over here okay so when this

788
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:18,419
maybe just over here okay so when this
 

789
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,720
maybe just over here okay so when this
hits zero hopefully it'll start working

790
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:20,730
hits zero hopefully it'll start working
 

791
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,350
hits zero hopefully it'll start working
now this is still powered by something

792

this is oh I left the oops that redstone

798
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:41,640
this is oh I left the oops that redstone
 

799
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,580

block is not supposed to be there I did

800
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:43,590
block is not supposed to be there I did
 

801
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,539
block is not supposed to be there I did
that for testing to see how long the how

802
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:47,549
that for testing to see how long the how
 

803
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,610
that for testing to see how long the how
long the redstone wire could reach okay

804
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:49,620
long the redstone wire could reach okay
 

805
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,960
long the redstone wire could reach okay
so now it's shooting out the top good

806
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:52,970
so now it's shooting out the top good
 

807
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,749
so now it's shooting out the top good
okay yeah netherworld goes up into the

808
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:56,759
okay yeah netherworld goes up into the
 

809
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,940
okay yeah netherworld goes up into the
hoppers branches over to there and then

810
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:58,950
hoppers branches over to there and then
 

811
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,340
hoppers branches over to there and then
back down into the chests so they should

812
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,350
back down into the chests so they should
 

813
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,470
back down into the chests so they should
start funneling into here nice and we

814
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
start funneling into here nice and we
 

815
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,999
start funneling into here nice and we
got plenty of storage with five double

816
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:08,009
got plenty of storage with five double
 

817
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,600
got plenty of storage with five double
chests should be good

818
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:10,610
chests should be good
 

819
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,430
chests should be good
aha so I'm just taking things over

820

sand block and you can do it this with
 

893
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:45,619
sand block and you can do it this with
gravel with red sand and VLEs I think

the lab but when it falls on it

912
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:06,380
the lab but when it falls on it
 

913
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,230
the lab but when it falls on it
kind of like that and it looks really

914
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
kind of like that and it looks really
 

915
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,850
kind of like that and it looks really
jumpy right now but I think once you

916

which was fun try out the challenge see

936
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:35,789
which was fun try out the challenge see
 

937
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,090
which was fun try out the challenge see
if you can do it I think if you flew up

938
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,100
if you can do it I think if you flew up
 

939
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,909
if you can do it I think if you flew up
high in the air it would be a lot easier

940
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:40,919
high in the air it would be a lot easier
 

941
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,680
high in the air it would be a lot easier
and just like glided your way down as

942
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,690
and just like glided your way down as
 

943

probably the way to go with that but I
 

947
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,210
probably the way to go with that but I
was the guess but yeah it's fun and yes
