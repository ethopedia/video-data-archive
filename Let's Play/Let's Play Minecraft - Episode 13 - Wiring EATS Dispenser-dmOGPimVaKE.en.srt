5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,370
is episode 13 and a lot of changes have
taken place since our last episode there

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,380
taken place since our last episode there
 

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,779
taken place since our last episode there
was a patch that a lot of new things who

8
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:17,789
was a patch that a lot of new things who
 

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,769
was a patch that a lot of new things who
made your leg there I'm also starting to

10
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:21,779
made your leg there I'm also starting to
 

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,130
made your leg there I'm also starting to
record in 720p which should make things

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
record in 720p which should make things
 

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,880
record in 720p which should make things
better I think

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:30,890

 

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,250

and also I am now running on a ram disk

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,260
and also I am now running on a ram disk
 

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,209
and also I am now running on a ram disk
so everything should load a lot faster

18
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219
so everything should load a lot faster
 

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,299
so everything should load a lot faster
now so I didn't get a chance to show you

20
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,309
now so I didn't get a chance to show you
 

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,869
now so I didn't get a chance to show you
this last episode but I wanted I built

22
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
this last episode but I wanted I built
 

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,590
this last episode but I wanted I built
this wall here out of water I wanted to

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
this wall here out of water I wanted to
 

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,729
this wall here out of water I wanted to
see how the mobs would react to it and I

26
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:58,739
see how the mobs would react to it and I
 

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:08,440
see how the mobs would react to it and I
also built a a double door trap system

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:08,450

 

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,280

I'm not sure if that works or not I

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,290
I'm not sure if that works or not I
 

31
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,020
I'm not sure if that works or not I
haven't tested that yet so I just want

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,030
haven't tested that yet so I just want
 

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,490
haven't tested that yet so I just want
to show you what this does first if I

34
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,500
to show you what this does first if I
 

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:31,280
to show you what this does first if I
can find some creepers yes come on come

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,290
can find some creepers yes come on come
 

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,539
can find some creepers yes come on come
on get these idiots to chase me

38
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:37,549
on get these idiots to chase me
 

39
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:48,279
on get these idiots to chase me
this way low okay come on let's go keep

40
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:48,289
this way low okay come on let's go keep
 

41
00:01:48,289 --> 00:02:00,219
this way low okay come on let's go keep
going this water wall is kind of

42
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,229
going this water wall is kind of
 

43
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,779
going this water wall is kind of
interesting for one thing it kills

44
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:04,789
interesting for one thing it kills
 

45
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,669
interesting for one thing it kills
creepers if they try to walk through it

46
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:06,679
creepers if they try to walk through it
 

47
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:11,650
creepers if they try to walk through it
if you dig in it deep enough and it

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,660
if you dig in it deep enough and it
 

49
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,949
if you dig in it deep enough and it
kills cows and I think it kills sheep

50
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:17,959
kills cows and I think it kills sheep
 

51
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:26,350
kills cows and I think it kills sheep
and pigs and chickens too spiders will

52
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,360
and pigs and chickens too spiders will
 

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,059
and pigs and chickens too spiders will
walk through it though and zombies and

54
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:31,069
walk through it though and zombies and
 

55
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,309
walk through it though and zombies and
skeletons will walk up to it and then

56
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,319
skeletons will walk up to it and then
 

57
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:43,930
skeletons will walk up to it and then
get stuck and they won't move anymore so

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:43,940
get stuck and they won't move anymore so
 

59
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,720
get stuck and they won't move anymore so
I thought that was kind of interesting

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,730

 

61
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,530

let's try find another creeper real

62
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:53,540
let's try find another creeper real
 

63
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,420
let's try find another creeper real
quick and see if we can get them in our

64
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,430
quick and see if we can get them in our
 

65
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,880
quick and see if we can get them in our
double door trap

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:02,890

 

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:19,300

to close whoa that was cool I don't know

68
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,310
to close whoa that was cool I don't know
 

69
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:28,539
to close whoa that was cool I don't know
if they'll go through this okay so they

70
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:28,549
if they'll go through this okay so they
 

71
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,710
if they'll go through this okay so they
still get stuck on it

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:29,720
still get stuck on it
 

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:49,620
still get stuck on it
I think or they won't drown at least

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,630

 

75
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,100

how's it going in there

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,110

 

77
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:06,370

oh yeah this is negligent work very well

78
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,380

 

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,460

anyway this episode I think we should

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,470
anyway this episode I think we should
 

81
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,810
anyway this episode I think we should
work on the road I keep saying I'm going

82
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:17,820
work on the road I keep saying I'm going
 

83
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,490
work on the road I keep saying I'm going
to show you guys how to wire it and I

84
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,500
to show you guys how to wire it and I
 

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,610
to show you guys how to wire it and I
still haven't done it and now we have

86
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:22,620
still haven't done it and now we have
 

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,920
still haven't done it and now we have
wire so there's really no excuse not to

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:24,930
wire so there's really no excuse not to
 

89
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:36,260
wire so there's really no excuse not to
do it oh yeah first thing we should do

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,270
do it oh yeah first thing we should do
 

91
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:44,350
do it oh yeah first thing we should do
is fix this water pattern down here

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:44,360

 

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,100

doing it that way

94
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,110
doing it that way
 

95
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,730
doing it that way
isn't a good idea

96
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:51,740

 

97
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,230

I've come up with a better way of doing

98
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
I've come up with a better way of doing
 

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,130
I've come up with a better way of doing
it

100
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,140

 

101
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:18,870

that that will need one sign

102
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880

 

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,110

like I said before problem with this the

104
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
like I said before problem with this the
 

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
like I said before problem with this the
way we had it there is if a boat lands

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,090
way we had it there is if a boat lands
 

107
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,250
way we had it there is if a boat lands
on another boat it's going to get stuck

108
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,260
on another boat it's going to get stuck
 

109
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,960
on another boat it's going to get stuck
permanently and all your boats are going

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:31,970
permanently and all your boats are going
 

111
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,210
permanently and all your boats are going
to get wrecked so we're going to place a

112
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,220
to get wrecked so we're going to place a
 

113
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:48,580
to get wrecked so we're going to place a
sign right here and place blocks above

114
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,590
sign right here and place blocks above
 

115
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:57,450
sign right here and place blocks above
here to stop this from happening and

116
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:57,460
here to stop this from happening and
 

117
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,070
here to stop this from happening and
torch here and so we've got a hollow

118
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,080
torch here and so we've got a hollow
 

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:12,000
torch here and so we've got a hollow
spot here we can place water there now

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,010

 

121
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,720

and then what we're going to try to do

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:19,730
and then what we're going to try to do
 

123
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:33,310
and then what we're going to try to do
is make the water bottom out here do

124
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,320
is make the water bottom out here do
 

125
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,110
is make the water bottom out here do
that we need to run it the full eight

126
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
that we need to run it the full eight
 

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:44,980
that we need to run it the full eight
blocks length so one two three four five

128
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:44,990
blocks length so one two three four five
 

129
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:52,360
blocks length so one two three four five
six seven eight

130
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,370

 

131
00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:02,080

there and then we can cover this up so

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,090
there and then we can cover this up so
 

133
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,850
there and then we can cover this up so
now if a boat comes down and lands on

134
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:06,860
now if a boat comes down and lands on
 

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,430
now if a boat comes down and lands on
here and another boat lands on it it'll

136
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
here and another boat lands on it it'll
 

137
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:22,960
here and another boat lands on it it'll
keep working still and also doing it

138
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:22,970
keep working still and also doing it
 

139
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,000
keep working still and also doing it
this way allows us to load boats down

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,010
this way allows us to load boats down
 

141
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:34,030
this way allows us to load boats down
there let's see here a little bit

142
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,040
there let's see here a little bit
 

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:47,640
there let's see here a little bit
disorganized here

144
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,650

 

145
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,140

okay oh yeah we are missing one

146
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,150
okay oh yeah we are missing one
 

147
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,690
okay oh yeah we are missing one
important thing on a road still and

148
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:58,700
important thing on a road still and
 

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,850
important thing on a road still and
someone was asking me about this they

150
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:03,860
someone was asking me about this they
 

151
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,590
someone was asking me about this they
were having problems with their Road and

152
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:05,600
were having problems with their Road and
 

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,040
were having problems with their Road and
it's because you need to have a ladder

154
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,050
it's because you need to have a ladder
 

155
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,190
it's because you need to have a ladder
here and a ladder here so that boats

156
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,200
here and a ladder here so that boats
 

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,190
here and a ladder here so that boats
when you hop in the boat it doesn't push

158
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,200
when you hop in the boat it doesn't push
 

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,320
when you hop in the boat it doesn't push
out this way the ladders stop it from

160
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,330
out this way the ladders stop it from
 

161
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:37,630
out this way the ladders stop it from
pushing out this way okay so yeah we can

162
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,640
pushing out this way okay so yeah we can
 

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,900
pushing out this way okay so yeah we can
load a boat by placing it right in this

164
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:40,910
load a boat by placing it right in this
 

165
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:52,900
load a boat by placing it right in this
square

166
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,910

 

167
00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:01,939

and it works just fine and I left the

168
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:01,949
and it works just fine and I left the
 

169
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:18,290
and it works just fine and I left the
door oh okay okay so to wire this thing

170
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,300
door oh okay okay so to wire this thing
 

171
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,639
door oh okay okay so to wire this thing
it's not too tricky we need to attach

172
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:25,649
it's not too tricky we need to attach
 

173
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:35,090
it's not too tricky we need to attach
this pressure plate to this door so

174
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
this pressure plate to this door so
 

175
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:43,250
this pressure plate to this door so
let's dig a hole for that I'm going to

176
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,260
let's dig a hole for that I'm going to
 

177
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,870
let's dig a hole for that I'm going to
place a ladder here so I can get out of

178
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
place a ladder here so I can get out of
 

179
00:09:44,880 --> 00:10:05,120
place a ladder here so I can get out of
here still

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,130

 

181
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,610

play some torches so we're going to dig

182
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,620
play some torches so we're going to dig
 

183
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,180
play some torches so we're going to dig
a hole here and then we're just going to

184
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,190
a hole here and then we're just going to
 

185
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:30,440
a hole here and then we're just going to
join them together like so and we need

186
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,450
join them together like so and we need
 

187
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,140
join them together like so and we need
to run the wire to the bottom of the

188
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,150
to run the wire to the bottom of the
 

189
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:51,050
to run the wire to the bottom of the
door so right here just like that so

190
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,060
door so right here just like that so
 

191
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,430
door so right here just like that so
that's one wire done already and we have

192
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
that's one wire done already and we have
 

193
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,650
that's one wire done already and we have
three wires to do so we can seal this

194
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:00,660
three wires to do so we can seal this
 

195
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,160
three wires to do so we can seal this
back up next wire we're going to do is

196
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,170
back up next wire we're going to do is
 

197
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,810
back up next wire we're going to do is
we have to connect this pressure plate

198
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:08,820
we have to connect this pressure plate
 

199
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,640
we have to connect this pressure plate
to this door which is a little bit more

200
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:13,650
to this door which is a little bit more
 

201
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,120
to this door which is a little bit more
tricky because they're close together so

202
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,130
tricky because they're close together so
 

203
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,030
tricky because they're close together so
to do that let's dig a hole around here

204
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
to do that let's dig a hole around here
 

205
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,980
to do that let's dig a hole around here
and we want all our wires hidden so it

206
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:27,990
and we want all our wires hidden so it
 

207
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:47,860
and we want all our wires hidden so it
looks good some iron

208
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:47,870

 

209
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,510

and also I don't suggest building this

210
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:50,520
and also I don't suggest building this
 

211
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,120
and also I don't suggest building this
in multiplayer servers just yet because

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,130
in multiplayer servers just yet because
 

213
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,800
in multiplayer servers just yet because
boats are still very glitchy and

214
00:11:59,800 --> 00:11:59,810
boats are still very glitchy and
 

215
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,940
boats are still very glitchy and
hopefully notch will fix them eventually

216
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:01,950
hopefully notch will fix them eventually
 

217
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,420
hopefully notch will fix them eventually
but for right now you're going to have a

218
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:05,430
but for right now you're going to have a
 

219
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,680
but for right now you're going to have a
lot of problems trying to get this

220
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:06,690
lot of problems trying to get this
 

221
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,900
lot of problems trying to get this
working as I've discovered because the

222
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:11,910
working as I've discovered because the
 

223
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,920
working as I've discovered because the
boats don't work consistently and they

224
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:15,930
boats don't work consistently and they
 

225
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,360
boats don't work consistently and they
behave differently than they do in

226
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,370
behave differently than they do in
 

227
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,450
behave differently than they do in
single-player with even though they

228
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:23,460
single-player with even though they
 

229
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:41,470
single-player with even though they
shouldn't okay so it's two blocks over

230
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,480

 

231
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,640

I'm just going to take this away from

232
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,650
I'm just going to take this away from
 

233
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm just going to take this away from
them now all right how did I do this

234
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:55,950
them now all right how did I do this
 

235
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:26,060
them now all right how did I do this
before doors over there

236
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,070

 

237
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:40,320

pressure plate is over here oh I don't

238
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,330
pressure plate is over here oh I don't
 

239
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,850
pressure plate is over here oh I don't
want to use that I think pressure plate

240
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:44,860
want to use that I think pressure plate
 

241
00:13:44,860 --> 00:14:06,800
want to use that I think pressure plate
is here yeah the water is lighting up so

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:06,810

 

243
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:14,620

I think to the way I did it before is

244
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:14,630
I think to the way I did it before is
 

245
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:24,410
I think to the way I did it before is
make some torches here I add a torch

246
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,420
make some torches here I add a torch
 

247
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:33,290
make some torches here I add a torch
here a block here and a torch underneath

248
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,300
here a block here and a torch underneath
 

249
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,800
here a block here and a torch underneath
the door and then you just run a wire

250
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:39,810
the door and then you just run a wire
 

251
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,290
the door and then you just run a wire
like this the pressure plate activates

252
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,300
like this the pressure plate activates
 

253
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,700
like this the pressure plate activates
it here goes through the torch next this

254
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:49,710
it here goes through the torch next this
 

255
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,030
it here goes through the torch next this
block lights up this which opens the

256
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
block lights up this which opens the
 

257
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:02,810
block lights up this which opens the
door so pretty simple you could probably

258
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:02,820
door so pretty simple you could probably
 

259
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,520
door so pretty simple you could probably
also do this without using any torches

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,530
also do this without using any torches
 

261
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:11,840
also do this without using any torches
but doesn't really matter so that's

262
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,850
but doesn't really matter so that's
 

263
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:21,190
but doesn't really matter so that's
another wire done just one left oh yeah

264
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,200
another wire done just one left oh yeah
 

265
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:33,470
another wire done just one left oh yeah
clean this up again

266
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480

 

267
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,150

hop in the boat door opens and go okay

268
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,160
hop in the boat door opens and go okay
 

269
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:48,330
hop in the boat door opens and go okay
so the next thing to do is this pressure

270
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:48,340
so the next thing to do is this pressure
 

271
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,330
so the next thing to do is this pressure
plate needs to open these two doors on

272
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:51,340
plate needs to open these two doors on
 

273
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:59,610
plate needs to open these two doors on
its press our weight needs to close

274
00:15:59,610 --> 00:15:59,620
its press our weight needs to close
 

275
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:06,980
its press our weight needs to close
these two doors when it's pressed and

276
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:06,990
these two doors when it's pressed and
 

277
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,540
these two doors when it's pressed and
I'm gonna have to take a hole here for

278
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,550
I'm gonna have to take a hole here for
 

279
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:19,260
I'm gonna have to take a hole here for
right now I had a lot of trouble with

280
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,270
right now I had a lot of trouble with
 

281
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,210
right now I had a lot of trouble with
this one because I found out you can't

282
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,220
this one because I found out you can't
 

283
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,290
this one because I found out you can't
use any redstone torches on it because

284
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:28,300
use any redstone torches on it because
 

285
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:39,380
use any redstone torches on it because
it will create too long with delay

286
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,390

 

287
00:16:39,390 --> 00:17:03,960

okay oops wait it's a lot easier doing

288
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:03,970
okay oops wait it's a lot easier doing
 

289
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:14,840
okay oops wait it's a lot easier doing
this if you have a lot of space around

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:14,850

 

291
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:43,990

so it goes one and then one over

292
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000

 

293
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,669

hmmm how did I have this before I think

294
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
hmmm how did I have this before I think
 

295
00:17:49,679 --> 00:18:06,590
hmmm how did I have this before I think
this is where the doors are yeah

296
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,600

 

297
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:18,060

alright okay so I think think we got to

298
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,070
alright okay so I think think we got to
 

299
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:25,520
alright okay so I think think we got to
do it this way place the wire inside

300
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:25,530
do it this way place the wire inside
 

301
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:32,940
do it this way place the wire inside
what was that noise I have company down

302
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:32,950
what was that noise I have company down
 

303
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,279
what was that noise I have company down
here place the wire beside the pressure

304
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:35,289
here place the wire beside the pressure
 

305
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:43,890
here place the wire beside the pressure
plate and make it go down one I read it

306
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:43,900
plate and make it go down one I read it
 

307
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,360
plate and make it go down one I read it
my sword Oh

308
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,370

 

309
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,090

so yeah just like this that connects to

310
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,100
so yeah just like this that connects to
 

311
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,610
so yeah just like this that connects to
one door just connects to the other door

312
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:53,620
one door just connects to the other door
 

313
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:09,090
one door just connects to the other door
and then you can seal this back up so

314
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,100
and then you can seal this back up so
 

315
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,799
and then you can seal this back up so
now when we these doors are open by a

316
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:10,809
now when we these doors are open by a
 

317
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:13,110
now when we these doors are open by a
default now let me step on it

318
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
default now let me step on it
 

319
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:31,260
default now let me step on it
they both closed oh okay there's some

320
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,270
they both closed oh okay there's some
 

321
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:39,200
they both closed oh okay there's some
school works that one still works

322
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,210

 

323
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:57,630

now stories so it's all wired and that's

324
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:57,640
now stories so it's all wired and that's
 

325
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,400
now stories so it's all wired and that's
how you do a neat throat and then for

326
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,410
how you do a neat throat and then for
 

327
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,170
how you do a neat throat and then for
the other end just copy the exact same

328
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,180
the other end just copy the exact same
 

329
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,700
the other end just copy the exact same
thing as we have over here and we're

330
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:08,710
thing as we have over here and we're
 

331
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,670
thing as we have over here and we're
going to experiment with the elevation

332
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:11,680
going to experiment with the elevation
 

333
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,040
going to experiment with the elevation
changes and also hopefully with making

334
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,050
changes and also hopefully with making
 

335
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,520
changes and also hopefully with making
right and left turns with the road and

336
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,530
right and left turns with the road and
 

337
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,000
right and left turns with the road and
other things like that but probably not

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,010
other things like that but probably not
 

339
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:41,810
other things like that but probably not
this episode yet let's go for a ride oh

340
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:41,820

 

341
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,160

yeah someone suggested I should hook up

342
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,170
yeah someone suggested I should hook up
 

343
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,960
yeah someone suggested I should hook up
music boxes to the pressure place I

344
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:47,970
music boxes to the pressure place I
 

345
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,950
music boxes to the pressure place I
actually kind of like that idea

346
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:49,960
actually kind of like that idea
 

347
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,810
actually kind of like that idea
I think I'm going to try that eventually

348
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:56,820

 

349
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,220

because you go over them pretty quickly

350
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,230
because you go over them pretty quickly
 

351
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,960
because you go over them pretty quickly
and I think you could make music out of

352
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:00,970
and I think you could make music out of
 

353
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:10,780
and I think you could make music out of
it

354
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:10,790

 

355
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:18,560

all right what now so I guess we pretty

356
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,570
all right what now so I guess we pretty
 

357
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,120
all right what now so I guess we pretty
much used up all our time for this

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,130

361
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,830

362
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840

363
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,910

368
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,350

it will be the start of my house using
the new dispenser blocks and I think

370
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:45,960

371
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,490
the new dispenser blocks and I think
they'll work good for a storage room

372
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:48,500
they'll work good for a storage room
 

373
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,840
