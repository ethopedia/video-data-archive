173
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,520

put redstone here and we're gonna have a

174
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:02,530
put redstone here and we're gonna have a
 

175
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,050
put redstone here and we're gonna have a
pressure plate above on the wood here

176
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,060
pressure plate above on the wood here
 

177
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,070
pressure plate above on the wood here
wooden pressure plates it'll go to

178
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,080
wooden pressure plates it'll go to
 

179
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,459
wooden pressure plates it'll go to
that's and we want I'm gonna have like a

180
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:11,469
that's and we want I'm gonna have like a
 

181
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:19,379
that's and we want I'm gonna have like a
stair like that and this is why we want

182
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:19,389
stair like that and this is why we want
 

183
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,239
stair like that and this is why we want
to enter pearls on this all the time

184
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:23,249

 

185
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,830

okay we want the start to pull back one

186
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
okay we want the start to pull back one
 

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,790

powered by default so oh we hit
 

197
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,929
powered by default so oh we hit
something over there what is this

198

something over there what is this
nothing jittery fingers this okay now if

200
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:57,279
nothing jittery fingers this okay now if
 

201
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,980
nothing jittery fingers this okay now if
that retracts will pull the stair back

202
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,990
that retracts will pull the stair back
 

203
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,320
that retracts will pull the stair back
and we want to use a stair so we can put

204

00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
want it to mirror that half arch on this
 

323
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,439
want it to mirror that half arch on this
side of the door well I discovered that

324
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:38,449
side of the door well I discovered that
 

325
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,920
side of the door well I discovered that
wasn't gonna work because the wall came

326
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:41,930
wasn't gonna work because the wall came
 

327
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,999
wasn't gonna work because the wall came
out to here before like the stone brick

328
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:49,009
out to here before like the stone brick
 

329
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,009
out to here before like the stone brick
lining and the stone wall was right

330
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:51,019
lining and the stone wall was right
 

331
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,040
lining and the stone wall was right
there so I juggled some of the wiring

332
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,050
there so I juggled some of the wiring
 

333
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,309
there so I juggled some of the wiring
around in here and compressed it and now

334
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,319
around in here and compressed it and now
 

335
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,540
around in here and compressed it and now
I'm able to move the wall not just one

336
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,550
I'm able to move the wall not just one
 

337
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,900
I'm able to move the wall not just one
block in which is what this would be but

338
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:04,910
block in which is what this would be but
 

339
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,710
block in which is what this would be but
two whole blocks in so I move the wall

340
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
two whole blocks in so I move the wall
 

341
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,139
two whole blocks in so I move the wall
from here to there so I should be able

342
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:14,149
from here to there so I should be able
 

343
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,490
from here to there so I should be able
to mimic that and that's what I'm gonna

344
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:15,500
to mimic that and that's what I'm gonna
 

345
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,030
to mimic that and that's what I'm gonna
do now

346
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,040
do now
 

347
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,350
do now
I got it mirrored and it looks pretty

348
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,360
I got it mirrored and it looks pretty
 

349
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,460
I got it mirrored and it looks pretty
good I'm happy with it

350

good I'm happy with it
check it out yep and then I added this

352
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:26,899
check it out yep and then I added this
 

353
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,939
check it out yep and then I added this
another arch here then I just need to

354
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:30,949
another arch here then I just need to
 

355
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,600
another arch here then I just need to
connect that to this somehow and we will

356
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:34,610
connect that to this somehow and we will
 

357
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,900
connect that to this somehow and we will
be done with the arches this whole area

358
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:37,910
be done with the arches this whole area
 

359
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,319
be done with the arches this whole area
will be connected together nicely every

360
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:41,329
will be connected together nicely every
 

361
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,939
will be connected together nicely every
section has arches and then here will be

362
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:45,949
section has arches and then here will be
 

363
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,420
section has arches and then here will be
open no more arches in this room so

364
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,430
open no more arches in this room so
 

365
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,180

because we might be able to put another

394
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:41,460
because we might be able to put another
 

395
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,300

room or something depending on how much
space we have well we'll definitely do

398
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
space we have well we'll definitely do
 

399
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,400
space we have well we'll definitely do
something but I just want to see how far

400
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,410
something but I just want to see how far
 

401
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,200
something but I just want to see how far
we can go before we run into something

402
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,210
we can go before we run into something
 

403
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:57,800
we can go before we run into something
I've built if we run into something I

404
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:57,810
I've built if we run into something I
 

405
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,250
I've built if we run into something I
built okay there we go

406
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,260
built okay there we go
 

407
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,050
built okay there we go
that is the cave spider staircase let's

408
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,060
that is the cave spider staircase let's
 

409
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,550
that is the cave spider staircase let's
just check that make sure it's in

just check that make sure it's in
 

411
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,460
just check that make sure it's in
working order yeah it should be fine

412
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,470
working order yeah it should be fine
 

413
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,490
working order yeah it should be fine
there's a sign right there oh there's

414
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:19,500
there's a sign right there oh there's
 

415
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,750
there's a sign right there oh there's
the other one okay just wanted to make

416
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
the other one okay just wanted to make
 

417
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,320
the other one okay just wanted to make
sure I didn't take the sign off somehow

418
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,330

 

419
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,630

yeah we could have a pretty big room

420
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:31,640
yeah we could have a pretty big room
 

421
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,410
yeah we could have a pretty big room
over here by the looks of it that's some

422
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:36,420
over here by the looks of it that's some
 

423
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:43,329
over here by the looks of it that's some
sorts maybe a bedroom or something

424
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:43,339
sorts maybe a bedroom or something
 

425
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,360
sorts maybe a bedroom or something
although I did oh all right I can take

426
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,370
although I did oh all right I can take
 

427
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,449
although I did oh all right I can take
this out I moved the wall one block and

428
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:50,459
this out I moved the wall one block and
 

429
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,920
this out I moved the wall one block and
then it's like you know I can move this

430
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:51,930
then it's like you know I can move this
 

431
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,690
then it's like you know I can move this
another one so I did it again that's why

432
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:53,700
another one so I did it again that's why
 

433
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,230
another one so I did it again that's why
it's so sick there

434
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,240
it's so sick there
 

435
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,670
it's so sick there
but yeah you get the idea that's pretty

436
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
but yeah you get the idea that's pretty
 

437
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,690
but yeah you get the idea that's pretty
good

438
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:04,700

 

439
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,120

what I'm thinking of doing is this the

440
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,130
what I'm thinking of doing is this the
 

441
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,010
what I'm thinking of doing is this the
mushroom farm the stairs go in like that

442
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,020
mushroom farm the stairs go in like that
 

443
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:22,370
mushroom farm the stairs go in like that
at the top what if we ate man even

444
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,380
at the top what if we ate man even
 

445
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,990
at the top what if we ate man even
harvested the mushrooms there's a lot of

446
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
harvested the mushrooms there's a lot of
 

447
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,790
harvested the mushrooms there's a lot of
slime chunks in my area here did not

448
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:31,800
slime chunks in my area here did not
 

449
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,050
slime chunks in my area here did not
come from the slime farm yeah like I

450
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,060
come from the slime farm yeah like I
 

451
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:45,320
come from the slime farm yeah like I
sink a mirror stairs like this somehow

452
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,330
sink a mirror stairs like this somehow
 

453
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:51,410
sink a mirror stairs like this somehow
and then I have a column like that maybe

454
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,420
and then I have a column like that maybe
 

455
00:16:51,420 --> 00:17:01,030
and then I have a column like that maybe
and then put something in between maybe

456
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040

 

457
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920

okay I did a few more things here this

458
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:03,930
okay I did a few more things here this
 

459
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,050
okay I did a few more things here this
kind of works I like this how it shapes

460
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,060
kind of works I like this how it shapes
 

461
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,960
kind of works I like this how it shapes
upward like that then we could have some

462
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:08,970
upward like that then we could have some
 

463
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,960
upward like that then we could have some
lighting either if we can make it work

464
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,970
lighting either if we can make it work
 

465
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,460
lighting either if we can make it work
without it burning anything we could put

466
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:13,470
without it burning anything we could put
 

467
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,960
without it burning anything we could put
lava somewhere behind there and try and

468
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:17,970
lava somewhere behind there and try and
 

469
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,760
lava somewhere behind there and try and
make it look good we'll leave it like

470
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:19,770
make it look good we'll leave it like
 

471
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,740
make it look good we'll leave it like
that for today though

472
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,750
that for today though
 

473
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,290
that for today though
then I added this thing which doesn't

474
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,300
then I added this thing which doesn't
 

475
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,590
then I added this thing which doesn't
look too great from this side but we

476
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
look too great from this side but we
 

477
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,770
look too great from this side but we
could cover up a lot of that with stone

478
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:29,780
could cover up a lot of that with stone
 

479
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,360
could cover up a lot of that with stone
like that square put some stone in front

480
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,370
like that square put some stone in front
 

481
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,680
like that square put some stone in front
but on this side it looks really good

482
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,690
but on this side it looks really good
 

483
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,130
but on this side it looks really good
and it mirrors that one got a nice

484
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,140
and it mirrors that one got a nice
 

485

lookout up here and then the space

486
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,410
lookout up here and then the space
 

487
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,800
lookout up here and then the space
between that one and that one is exactly

488
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:51,810
between that one and that one is exactly
 

489
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,320
between that one and that one is exactly
the same as this arch here so I could

490
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,330
the same as this arch here so I could
 

491
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,750
the same as this arch here so I could
just copy that too

492
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760

 

493
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,150

which is what I might try see that what

494

which is what I might try see that what
 

495
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,280
which is what I might try see that what
happens to be changed do that and we'll

496

happens to be changed do that and we'll
 

497
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,560
happens to be changed do that and we'll
just lay out the shape really quickly

498
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,570
just lay out the shape really quickly
 

499

keeping an eye on him
he hasn't gone out gone through them

690
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:02,879
he hasn't gone out gone through them
 

691
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:06,259
he hasn't gone out gone through them
since he's gone through them

692
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:06,269
since he's gone through them
 

693
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:08,269
since he's gone through them
he hasn't come back through them since

694
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:08,279
he hasn't come back through them since
 

695
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,919
he hasn't come back through them since
he went into them I should say or

696
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:09,929
he went into them I should say or
 

697
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,469
he went into them I should say or
however you want to say it so he's he's

698

however you want to say it so he's he's
 

699
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,259
however you want to say it so he's he's
inside I'm pretty sure where he thinks

700
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:15,269
inside I'm pretty sure where he thinks
 

701
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:17,959
inside I'm pretty sure where he thinks
he's inside I'm guessing when it turns

702

00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:32,249
what he does if you'll come through the
 

715
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:36,589
what he does if you'll come through the
doors he hasn't gone through them all

716
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:36,599

problems with it and that's all we're
gonna do for today guys I have a comment

780

wondering how you feel about using the

788
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:23,730
wondering how you feel about using the
 

789
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,980
wondering how you feel about using the
snapshots in your LP I think that

790
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:26,990
snapshots in your LP I think that
 

791
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,539
snapshots in your LP I think that
decoration items would work for you like

792
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:29,549
decoration items would work for you like
 

793
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,460
decoration items would work for you like
for arrows with the frames or with

794
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:31,470
for arrows with the frames or with
 

795
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,100
for arrows with the frames or with
sorting hope you read this beam yeah you

796
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,110
sorting hope you read this beam yeah you
 

797
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,960
sorting hope you read this beam yeah you
know what I've been really tempted to

know what I've been really tempted to
 

799
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,280
know what I've been really tempted to
use the snapshots in in the let's play

800
