479
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,610
see yeah let's go down our tunnel here
I'd built the nether brewing system over

480
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:35,620
I'd built the nether brewing system over
 

481
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,079
I'd built the nether brewing system over
at the dual blades farm I thought that

482
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:37,089
at the dual blades farm I thought that
 

483
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,370
at the dual blades farm I thought that
would be a good spot for it because we

484
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:38,380
would be a good spot for it because we
 

485
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,150
would be a good spot for it because we
got a bit of space to fill here um I've

486
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
got a bit of space to fill here um I've
 

487
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,179
got a bit of space to fill here um I've
been working on the tunnel it's still

488
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:45,189
been working on the tunnel it's still
 

489
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:48,809
been working on the tunnel it's still
very unfinished but this is sort of the

490
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:48,819
very unfinished but this is sort of the
 

491
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,309
very unfinished but this is sort of the
design I'm going for I think it looks

492
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:50,319
design I'm going for I think it looks
 

493
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,069
design I'm going for I think it looks
pretty decent actually I know not

494
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:53,079
pretty decent actually I know not
 

495
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,110
pretty decent actually I know not
everybody likes these purpura blocks but

496
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
everybody likes these purpura blocks but
 

497
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,150
everybody likes these purpura blocks but
personally I think they're really nice

498
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,160
personally I think they're really nice
 

499
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
personally I think they're really nice
and I like the mixed with yellow like

500
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:58,810
and I like the mixed with yellow like
 

501
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,879
and I like the mixed with yellow like
sandstone or similar to what we have at

502
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:02,889
sandstone or similar to what we have at
 

503
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,120
sandstone or similar to what we have at
our nether hub that the purple and and

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,130
our nether hub that the purple and and
 

505
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,090
our nether hub that the purple and and
yellow mixture at the nether hub we did

506
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,100
yellow mixture at the nether hub we did
 

507
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,920
yellow mixture at the nether hub we did
purple wall and sandstone here we have

508
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:10,930
purple wall and sandstone here we have
 

509
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,549
purple wall and sandstone here we have
purple blocks in sandstone but anyways

510
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:14,559
purple blocks in sandstone but anyways
 

511
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,410
purple blocks in sandstone but anyways
let's go ahead and try out some of the

512
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:16,420
let's go ahead and try out some of the
 

513
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,929
let's go ahead and try out some of the
stuff we got built here all of this is

514
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:18,939
stuff we got built here all of this is
 

515
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,970
stuff we got built here all of this is
untested I like to include you guys for

516
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:20,980
untested I like to include you guys for
 

517
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,860
untested I like to include you guys for
the very first test usually so you can

518
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:22,870
the very first test usually so you can
 

519
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,660
the very first test usually so you can
watch me fail let's see let's do let's

520
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,670
watch me fail let's see let's do let's
 

521
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,100
watch me fail let's see let's do let's
do 20 20 wet sponges and ideas you drop

522
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,110
do 20 20 wet sponges and ideas you drop
 

523
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,500
do 20 20 wet sponges and ideas you drop
Moff here we did all this last episode

524
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,510
Moff here we did all this last episode
 

525
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,750
Moff here we did all this last episode
so it should be pretty clear put that in

526
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:36,760
so it should be pretty clear put that in
 

527
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:44,460
so it should be pretty clear put that in
there and it should not work excellent

528
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,470
there and it should not work excellent
 

529
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,620
there and it should not work excellent
it's going so smooth

530
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,630
it's going so smooth
 

531
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,410
it's going so smooth
did I forget some redstone or do I have

532
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:49,420
did I forget some redstone or do I have
 

533
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,120
did I forget some redstone or do I have
to activate this once before it will

534
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,130
to activate this once before it will
 

535
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,840
to activate this once before it will
work maybe got a little access here with

536
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:54,850
work maybe got a little access here with
 

537
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,550
work maybe got a little access here with
the iron door too which is nice in case

538
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
the iron door too which is nice in case
 

539
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,519
the iron door too which is nice in case
we have problems I think maybe I was

540
00:13:59,519 --> 00:13:59,529
we have problems I think maybe I was
 

541
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:01,740
we have problems I think maybe I was
supposed to activate this once before I

542
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:01,750
supposed to activate this once before I
 

543
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,750
supposed to activate this once before I
do that and then it works every time we

544
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:06,760
do that and then it works every time we
 

545
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,930
do that and then it works every time we
have a button there we go I think we can

546
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:09,940
have a button there we go I think we can
 

547
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,509
have a button there we go I think we can
put a button on here and that'll trigger

548
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:12,519
put a button on here and that'll trigger
 

549
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,730
put a button on here and that'll trigger
everything I hope I hope I hope yeah

550
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:17,740
everything I hope I hope I hope yeah
 

551
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,130
everything I hope I hope I hope yeah
okay so it's got the sticks in there

552
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,140
okay so it's got the sticks in there
 

553
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,990
okay so it's got the sticks in there
we got the empty bucket waiting to go in

554
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
we got the empty bucket waiting to go in
 

555
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,280
we got the empty bucket waiting to go in
and now I think it'll go continuously

556
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,290
and now I think it'll go continuously
 

557
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:34,680
and now I think it'll go continuously
right ah watch a comparator oh it did

558
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:34,690
right ah watch a comparator oh it did
 

559
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,439
right ah watch a comparator oh it did
light up it did light up okay so why is

560
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:37,449
light up it did light up okay so why is
 

561
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:43,019
light up it did light up okay so why is
it not working then oh it is now I

562
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:43,029
it not working then oh it is now I
 

563
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,400
it not working then oh it is now I
didn't change anything well now it works

564
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,410
didn't change anything well now it works
 

565
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,670
didn't change anything well now it works
okay whatever alright so that is part

566
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:50,680
okay whatever alright so that is part
 

567
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,620
okay whatever alright so that is part
one of our nether brewing system here we

568
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,630
one of our nether brewing system here we
 

569
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,300
one of our nether brewing system here we
get the water buckets from the wet

570
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,310
get the water buckets from the wet
 

571
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,790
get the water buckets from the wet
sponges and those end up in here the

572
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
sponges and those end up in here the
 

573
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,069
sponges and those end up in here the
reason I built this so high up is

574
00:14:59,069 --> 00:14:59,079
reason I built this so high up is
 

575
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,720
reason I built this so high up is
because that way I don't have to do a

576
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:02,730
because that way I don't have to do a
 

577
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,790
because that way I don't have to do a
item elevator here just it funnels in

578
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:05,800
item elevator here just it funnels in
 

579
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
item elevator here just it funnels in
perfectly into this dropper this way

580
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,570
perfectly into this dropper this way
 

581
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,269
perfectly into this dropper this way
I've got the double chests here that's

582
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
I've got the double chests here that's
 

583
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,780
I've got the double chests here that's
storing up more water buckets um doesn't

584
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:12,790
storing up more water buckets um doesn't
 

585
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,180
storing up more water buckets um doesn't
look quite level with our Sun although

586
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,190
look quite level with our Sun although
 

587
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,560
look quite level with our Sun although
unfortunately it's a little higher than

588
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,570
unfortunately it's a little higher than
 

589
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,110
unfortunately it's a little higher than
I would like but also I should probably

590
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
I would like but also I should probably
 

591
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,689
I would like but also I should probably
put an iron trapdoor here or something

592
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:21,699
put an iron trapdoor here or something
 

593
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,009
put an iron trapdoor here or something
because eventually I'm going to want to

594
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:23,019
because eventually I'm going to want to
 

595
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,430
because eventually I'm going to want to
take these dry sponges out of here and

596
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
take these dry sponges out of here and
 

597
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
take these dry sponges out of here and
we need access to that too so I think

598
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:28,810
we need access to that too so I think
 

599
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,680
we need access to that too so I think
this is actually a good height for it

600
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,690
this is actually a good height for it
 

601
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,090
this is actually a good height for it
yeah there we go I think that looks good

602
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,100
yeah there we go I think that looks good
 

603
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,350
yeah there we go I think that looks good
now I'm happy with that

604
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,360
now I'm happy with that
 

605
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,990
now I'm happy with that
so we got a button for the trapdoor over

606
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,000
so we got a button for the trapdoor over
 

607
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,490
so we got a button for the trapdoor over
here it's a little bit off on the side

608
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,500
here it's a little bit off on the side
 

609
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,160
here it's a little bit off on the side
but it works you can click that in and

610
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,170
but it works you can click that in and
 

611
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,600
but it works you can click that in and
look into the hopper here then pull the

612
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:42,610
look into the hopper here then pull the
 

613
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,929
look into the hopper here then pull the
sponges out and I figured out why this

614
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:45,939
sponges out and I figured out why this
 

615
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,460
sponges out and I figured out why this
and work the first two times the first

616
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,470
and work the first two times the first
 

617
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,869
and work the first two times the first
time you got to press that button just

618
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:48,879
time you got to press that button just
 

619
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,599
time you got to press that button just
to get the sticks and the buckets ready

620
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:50,609
to get the sticks and the buckets ready
 

621
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:52,559
to get the sticks and the buckets ready
they're supposed to be waiting in there

622
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:52,569
they're supposed to be waiting in there
 

623
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,349
they're supposed to be waiting in there
for the sponge so then we click this

624
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:55,359
for the sponge so then we click this
 

625
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,229
for the sponge so then we click this
gets it going it didn't work the second

626
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:58,239
gets it going it didn't work the second
 

627
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,960
gets it going it didn't work the second
time because we also need one bucket in

628
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:00,970
time because we also need one bucket in
 

629
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,710
time because we also need one bucket in
here one water bucket before it will

630
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
here one water bucket before it will
 

631
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
here one water bucket before it will
activate the comparator somebody said I

632
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:07,209
activate the comparator somebody said I
 

633
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,239
activate the comparator somebody said I
could probably just lengthen this

634
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:09,249
could probably just lengthen this
 

635
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,609
could probably just lengthen this

repeater so no buckets get stuck here
 

637
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:14,159
repeater so no buckets get stuck here
but I tried doing that and it doesn't

638
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,169
but I tried doing that and it doesn't
 

639
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,629
but I tried doing that and it doesn't
work it throws off the timing on the

640
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:15,639
work it throws off the timing on the
 

641
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,119
work it throws off the timing on the
whole system and it doesn't do the loop

642
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:18,129
whole system and it doesn't do the loop
 

643
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,029
whole system and it doesn't do the loop
that after that so I'm going to leave it

644
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:21,039
that after that so I'm going to leave it
 

645
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,389
that after that so I'm going to leave it
like that

646
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
like that
 

647
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,019
like that
and first part of this is done it's it's

648
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:25,029
and first part of this is done it's it's
 

649
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,789
and first part of this is done it's it's
pretty simple just drop off the sponges

650
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:26,799
pretty simple just drop off the sponges
 

651
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,429
pretty simple just drop off the sponges
and press the button I like it doesn't

652
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:29,439
and press the button I like it doesn't
 

653
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,009
and press the button I like it doesn't
really take our time

654
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,019
really take our time
 

655
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,559
really take our time
oops we just have to wait for it to do

656
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:34,569
oops we just have to wait for it to do
 

657

we did last episode just because i was
 

677
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:08,789
we did last episode just because i was
lazy and I saw those afterwards um but

00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:09,909
yeah there's definitely a lot of
 

681
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,059
yeah there's definitely a lot of
different ways you could do this

682
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:11,069
different ways you could do this
 

683
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,100
different ways you could do this
some of something to keep in mind though

684
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,110
some of something to keep in mind though
 

685
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,829
some of something to keep in mind though
is cauldron mechanics have changed in

1.9 so what might work in 1.8 you might

688
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:20,740
1.9 so what might work in 1.8 you might
 

689
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,019
1.9 so what might work in 1.8 you might
not necessarily work in 1.9 I'm pretty

690
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:25,029
not necessarily work in 1.9 I'm pretty
 

691
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,549
not necessarily work in 1.9 I'm pretty
happy with this I think this is good

they go down oh and by the way I could

698
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,730
they go down oh and by the way I could

here and put them back into our sponge

704
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,130
here and put them back into our sponge
 

705
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,940
here and put them back into our sponge
machine but it just didn't seem worth it

706
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:45,950
machine but it just didn't seem worth it
 

707
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,159
machine but it just didn't seem worth it
I just put a trapdoor no I'll manually

708
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:48,169
I just put a trapdoor no I'll manually
 

709
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,409
I just put a trapdoor no I'll manually
move them same with these empty bottles

move them same with these empty bottles
 

711
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,880
move them same with these empty bottles
I'll just grab them put them in here

712
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:51,890
I'll just grab them put them in here
 

713
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,360
I'll just grab them put them in here
manually ok so part three of the system

714
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,370
manually ok so part three of the system
 

715
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,130
manually ok so part three of the system
is probably the most important part of

716
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,140
is probably the most important part of
 

717
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,690
is probably the most important part of
the whole thing the actual brewing

718
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:58,700
the whole thing the actual brewing
 

719
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,500
the whole thing the actual brewing
system I decided to put down over there

720
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:01,510
system I decided to put down over there
 

721
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,270
system I decided to put down over there
so that I could avoid using item

722
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,280
so that I could avoid using item
 

723
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,730
so that I could avoid using item
elevators for the most part with the

724
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:06,740
elevators for the most part with the
 

725
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,950
elevators for the most part with the
system and it might look a little

726
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
system and it might look a little
 

727
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,779
system and it might look a little
familiar to you this is actually a

umm decide to build a here so we could
 

737
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,490
umm decide to build a here so we could
try it out in 1.9 make sure it still

738

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,600
with this is the confusing part I was
looking at the comments for this system

744
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:31,610
looking at the comments for this system
 

745
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,940
looking at the comments for this system
and like a lot of people were like oh it

746
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:33,950
and like a lot of people were like oh it
 

747
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,740
and like a lot of people were like oh it
doesn't work it doesn't work you wasted

748

think it's going yeah so it's a fully
automatic brewing system and it's super

822
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:23,179
automatic brewing system and it's super
 

823
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,419
automatic brewing system and it's super
simple super simple let me just show you

824

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,080
back here one more time again there is a
 

827
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,529
back here one more time again there is a
tutorial for this so if you want the

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,330
clocks or anything it's it's intelligent
 

843
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,840

it knows what what it's doing and some

844
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:52,850
it knows what what it's doing and some
 

845
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,430

people are saying it even works if their

846
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,440
people are saying it even works if their
 

847
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,260
people are saying it even works if their
server legs so that's good to hear

848
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,270
server legs so that's good to hear
 

849
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,580
server legs so that's good to hear
ah so that's our brewing system I think

850
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,590
ah so that's our brewing system I think
 

851
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,100
ah so that's our brewing system I think
we're we're good to go now finish it

852
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,110
we're we're good to go now finish it
 

853
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,659
we're we're good to go now finish it
does take a lot of time though that's

854
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:07,669
does take a lot of time though that's
 

855
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:09,310
does take a lot of time though that's
the thing I like about the chaining ones

856
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,320
the thing I like about the chaining ones
 

857
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,950
the thing I like about the chaining ones
that we have in the the big brewing room

858
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:13,960

 

859
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,990

okay that's switched out good but what

860
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,000
okay that's switched out good but what
 

861
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,149
okay that's switched out good but what
puts water bottles in so this is going

862
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:19,159
puts water bottles in so this is going
 

863
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,120
puts water bottles in so this is going
to be nether wart and then does it

864
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,130
to be nether wart and then does it
 

865
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,370
to be nether wart and then does it
switch to spider eyes again it should

866
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,380
switch to spider eyes again it should
 

867
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,320
switch to spider eyes again it should
right or is it going to give us two

868
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,330
right or is it going to give us two
 

869
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,350
right or is it going to give us two
nether warts I might have made a mistake

870
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
nether warts I might have made a mistake
 

871
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,820
nether warts I might have made a mistake

try out the gold farm now I'm very

878
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,120
try out the gold farm now I'm very
 

879
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,140
try out the gold farm now I'm very
curious I'm really hoping this works now

880
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,150
curious I'm really hoping this works now
 

881
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,149
curious I'm really hoping this works now
if it doesn't I'm probably going to have

882
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:49,159
if it doesn't I'm probably going to have
 

883
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,850
if it doesn't I'm probably going to have
to build a new one gold farm number

884
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:51,860
to build a new one gold farm number
 

885
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,299
to build a new one gold farm number
three light the portals this took a

886
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:55,309
three light the portals this took a
 

887
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,909
three light the portals this took a
long time before and it seems to still

888
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:57,919
long time before and it seems to still
 

889
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,940
long time before and it seems to still
take quite a bit of time not as long as

problem was once we get near the top of

896
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:08,870
problem was once we get near the top of
 

897
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,320

the nether the game totally would freeze

898
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,330
the nether the game totally would freeze
 

899
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:19,049
the nether the game totally would freeze
before like this exactly like this ah

900
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:19,059

 

901
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,289

so I'm right-clicking but I can't go

904
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:21,649
so I'm right-clicking but I can't go
 

905
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:24,519
so I'm right-clicking but I can't go
into that minecart it's not because it's

906
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:24,529
into that minecart it's not because it's
 

907
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,139
into that minecart it's not because it's
too far away it's because my game is

908
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:26,149
too far away it's because my game is
 

909
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,869
too far away it's because my game is
totally shut down pretty much can I

910
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:28,879
totally shut down pretty much can I

one there okay I think it is actually
 

917
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,330
one there okay I think it is actually
working I think I just can't teleport

918
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:43,340
working I think I just can't teleport
 

919
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,430
working I think I just can't teleport
until that last minecart for some reason

920
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
until that last minecart for some reason
 

921
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,989
until that last minecart for some reason
I'm gonna have to try figure that out

922
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:46,999
I'm gonna have to try figure that out
 

923
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,330
I'm gonna have to try figure that out
but let that maze I'll be Pigman have

924
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:49,340
but let that maze I'll be Pigman have
 

925
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,009
but let that maze I'll be Pigman have
spawned here I was only up there for

926
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:51,019
spawned here I was only up there for
 

927
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:56,080
spawned here I was only up there for
like a minute at most um you're supposed

928
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,090
like a minute at most um you're supposed
 

929
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,330
like a minute at most um you're supposed
to shut this portal off first before

930
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:58,340
to shut this portal off first before
 

931
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,759
to shut this portal off first before
using the gold farm wrong button I think

932
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:05,769
using the gold farm wrong button I think
 

933
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,289
using the gold farm wrong button I think
yeah so we shut that off we got to get

934
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:08,299
yeah so we shut that off we got to get
 

935
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,720
yeah so we shut that off we got to get
out of here and enter from the gold farm

936
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:12,730
out of here and enter from the gold farm
 

937
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,950
out of here and enter from the gold farm
this is a very bad idea I gotta get out

938
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960
this is a very bad idea I gotta get out
 

939
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,850
this is a very bad idea I gotta get out
of here it worked

940
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:20,860
of here it worked
 

941
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,379
of here it worked
whoo I'm still like really practicing my

942
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:26,389
whoo I'm still like really practicing my
 

943
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,600
whoo I'm still like really practicing my
take off with a bow I think the trick is

944
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:28,610
take off with a bow I think the trick is
 

945
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,340
take off with a bow I think the trick is
if you guys are trying to learn how to

946
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,350
if you guys are trying to learn how to
 

947
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,070
if you guys are trying to learn how to
do this too you want to look up slightly

948
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,080
do this too you want to look up slightly
 

949
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,289
do this too you want to look up slightly
like you don't want your cursor

950
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:34,299
like you don't want your cursor
 

951
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:36,580
like you don't want your cursor
