items fast enough so
 

169
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,710

little bit too like the land so it's

336
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
little bit too like the land so it's
 

337
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,590
little bit too like the land so it's
kind of the same level as the wood here

338
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
kind of the same level as the wood here
 

339
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,270
kind of the same level as the wood here
i want to do a little bit more to blend

340
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
i want to do a little bit more to blend
 

341
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,990
i want to do a little bit more to blend
it in but maybe uh maybe not today

342
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
it in but maybe uh maybe not today
 

343
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,990
it in but maybe uh maybe not today
but let's just take a look from a

344
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
but let's just take a look from a
 

345
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,749
but let's just take a look from a
distance to get an idea of what it looks

346
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
distance to get an idea of what it looks
 

347
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,790
distance to get an idea of what it looks
like so it goes all

348
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
like so it goes all
 

349
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,390
like so it goes all
all the way around pretty much from here

350
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
all the way around pretty much from here
 

351
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,870
all the way around pretty much from here
to over there i'm going to stop moving

352
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
to over there i'm going to stop moving
 

353
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,309
to over there i'm going to stop moving
the camera so you can look at it

354
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
the camera so you can look at it
 

355
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,510

and form an opinion all right i built a

356
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,550
lava you can fall in yeah it's it's not
very safe even

500
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
very safe even
 

501
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,710
very safe even
all right and then it gets an old

502
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
all right and then it gets an old
 

503
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,150
all right and then it gets an old
fortress

504
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
fortress
 

505
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,670
fortress
let's keep on moving it's kind of

506
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
let's keep on moving it's kind of
 

507
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,190
let's keep on moving it's kind of
hollowed this out a little bit it's

508
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
hollowed this out a little bit it's
 

509
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,389
hollowed this out a little bit it's
nothing polished or finished at all

510
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
nothing polished or finished at all
 

511
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,230
nothing polished or finished at all
and then here is the blaze farm the dual

512
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
and then here is the blaze farm the dual
 

513
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,310
and then here is the blaze farm the dual
blaze farm

514
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
blaze farm
 

515
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,230
blaze farm
okay go up the ladder to turn this

516
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
okay go up the ladder to turn this
 

517
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,350
okay go up the ladder to turn this
on i did something really goofy here

518
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
on i did something really goofy here
 

519
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,670
on i did something really goofy here
i believe this is like a big clock

520
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680

 

521
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,509

and then this runs non-stop

522
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
and then this runs non-stop
 

523
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,110
and then this runs non-stop
i wasn't very good at redstone when i

524
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
i wasn't very good at redstone when i
 

525
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,670
i wasn't very good at redstone when i
built this i'll tell you guys that

526
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
built this i'll tell you guys that
 

527
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,990
built this i'll tell you guys that
so i probably could improve quite a few

528
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
so i probably could improve quite a few
 

529
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,350
so i probably could improve quite a few
things

530
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
things
 

531
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,470
things
now this is on yeah

532
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
now this is on yeah
 

533
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,310
now this is on yeah
there is a lava switch to shut it off

534
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
there is a lava switch to shut it off
 

535
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,710
there is a lava switch to shut it off
but it's on right now

536
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
but it's on right now
 

537
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,990
but it's on right now
light levels in this area

538
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000

 

539
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,230

it's a little bit bright over here

540
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
it's a little bit bright over here
 

541
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,350
it's a little bit bright over here

through the torch oh yeah

544
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
through the torch oh yeah
 

545
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,990
through the torch oh yeah
can't have a torch there okay

546
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
can't have a torch there okay
 

547
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,069
can't have a torch there okay
and then they go down this conveyor belt

548
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
and then they go down this conveyor belt
 

549
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,430
and then they go down this conveyor belt
it looks like he got

550
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
it looks like he got
 

551
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,790
it looks like he got
stuck there right

552
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800

 

553
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,030

yeah so we're gonna need another type of

554
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
yeah so we're gonna need another type of
 

555
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,790
yeah so we're gonna need another type of
mob elevator

556
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
mob elevator
 

557
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,069
mob elevator
to get them up this little portion here

558
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079

 

559
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,310

i don't know what to do with that trying

560
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
i don't know what to do with that trying
 

561
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,910
i don't know what to do with that trying
to think of an idea on the spot right

562
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
to think of an idea on the spot right
 

563
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,069
to think of an idea on the spot right
now it's not coming to me

564
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
now it's not coming to me
 

565
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,350
now it's not coming to me
uh slime block launchers maybe oh uh

566
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
uh slime block launchers maybe oh uh
 

567
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,110
uh slime block launchers maybe oh uh
oh if i could get one of those shulkers

568
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
oh if i could get one of those shulkers
 

569
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,949
oh if i could get one of those shulkers
over here and like have them levitate

570
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
over here and like have them levitate
 

571
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,870
over here and like have them levitate
that would be amazing

572
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880

 

573
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,829

okay well i've looked at this some more

574
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
okay well i've looked at this some more
 

575
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,670
okay well i've looked at this some more
i got it shut off right now this is what

576
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
i got it shut off right now this is what
 

577
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:45,990
i got it shut off right now this is what
it

578
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
it
 

579
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,509
it
looks like when it's shut off the lava

580
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
looks like when it's shut off the lava
 

581
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,110
looks like when it's shut off the lava
comes down and makes it bright enough so

582
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
comes down and makes it bright enough so
 

583
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,949
comes down and makes it bright enough so
they can't spawn

584
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
they can't spawn
 

585
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,870
they can't spawn
uh it looks like there is no easy

586
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
uh it looks like there is no easy
 

587
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,949
uh it looks like there is no easy
fix that i can think of anyway so before

588
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
fix that i can think of anyway so before
 

589
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,150
fix that i can think of anyway so before
it's a little hard to see from this

590
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
it's a little hard to see from this
 

591
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,710
it's a little hard to see from this
angle they swim up this lava right

592
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
angle they swim up this lava right
 

593
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,630
angle they swim up this lava right
and then there was a block at the top

594
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
and then there was a block at the top
 

595
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,790
and then there was a block at the top
there that stopped them from entering

596
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
there that stopped them from entering
 

597
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,069
there that stopped them from entering
the the killing chamber here

598
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
the the killing chamber here
 

599
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,389
the the killing chamber here
uh yeah so

600
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
uh yeah so
 

601
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,990
uh yeah so
more lava would flow out that would make

602
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
more lava would flow out that would make
 

603
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,430
more lava would flow out that would make
them go up even higher

604
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
them go up even higher
 

605
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,710
them go up even higher
and then that would get shut off right

606
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
and then that would get shut off right
 

607
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,550
and then that would get shut off right
there on a timer no

608
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
there on a timer no
 

609
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,670
there on a timer no
oh then i think i had to hit the crusher

610
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
oh then i think i had to hit the crusher
 

611
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,910
oh then i think i had to hit the crusher
it's been a while that shut off that

612
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
it's been a while that shut off that
 

613
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
it's been a while that shut off that
lava yeah okay

614
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
lava yeah okay
 

615
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,670
lava yeah okay
and then this block goes back into place

616
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
and then this block goes back into place
 

617
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,630
and then this block goes back into place
the problem is

618
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
the problem is
 

619
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,470
the problem is
if we do like levitation with the

620
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
if we do like levitation with the
 

621
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,670
if we do like levitation with the
shulker

622
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
shulker
 

623
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,590
shulker
the levitation only lasts for a couple

624
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
the levitation only lasts for a couple
 

625
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,949
the levitation only lasts for a couple
seconds so they're gonna

626
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
seconds so they're gonna
 

627
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,430
seconds so they're gonna
float up to the top and then they're

628
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
float up to the top and then they're
 

629
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,790
float up to the top and then they're
just gonna start falling down so that's

630
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
just gonna start falling down so that's
 

631
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,829
just gonna start falling down so that's
not gonna work

632
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
not gonna work
 

633
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,590
not gonna work
slime block launchers we would have to

634
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
slime block launchers we would have to
 

635
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,870
slime block launchers we would have to
catch them before they

636
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
catch them before they
 

637
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,150
catch them before they
start falling back so no easy

638
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
start falling back so no easy
 

639
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,670
start falling back so no easy
fix as far as i can tell but i got uh

640
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
fix as far as i can tell but i got uh
 

641
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,350
fix as far as i can tell but i got uh
some plans if we want to do some major

642
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
some plans if we want to do some major
 

643
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,590
some plans if we want to do some major
remodeling here

644
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
remodeling here
 

645
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,110
remodeling here
formulated a plan good news is it's

646
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
formulated a plan good news is it's
 

647
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,509
formulated a plan good news is it's
going to be really cool the bad news

648
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
going to be really cool the bad news
 

649
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,350
going to be really cool the bad news
we have to destroy some nostalgic

650
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
we have to destroy some nostalgic
 

651
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,629
we have to destroy some nostalgic
stuff here so this conveyor belt thing

652
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
stuff here so this conveyor belt thing
 

653
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,470
stuff here so this conveyor belt thing
we would have to get rid of let's i'm

654
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
we would have to get rid of let's i'm
 

655
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,750
we would have to get rid of let's i'm
just going to remove a little bit of it

656
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
just going to remove a little bit of it
 

657
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,269
just going to remove a little bit of it
so we can play around with the idea

658
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279

 

659
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,790

but i'm not going to destroy all this

660
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
but i'm not going to destroy all this
 

661
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,710
but i'm not going to destroy all this
just in case this doesn't work we can

662
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
just in case this doesn't work we can
 

663
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,230
just in case this doesn't work we can
we can just put it back okay so

664
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240

 

665
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,910

they fall down here first thing i'm

666
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
they fall down here first thing i'm
 

667
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,750
they fall down here first thing i'm
going to do

668
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
going to do
 

669
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,949
going to do
is set up a slime block launcher to the

670
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
is set up a slime block launcher to the
 

671
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,590
is set up a slime block launcher to the
side

672
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
side
 

673
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,949
side
so there's going to be a

674
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959

 

675
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,470

really the one thing i didn't bring was

676
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
really the one thing i didn't bring was
 

677
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,990
really the one thing i didn't bring was
slime

678
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
slime
 

679
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,310
slime
uh-huh there's actually some slime in

680
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
uh-huh there's actually some slime in
 

681
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,750
uh-huh there's actually some slime in
the chests up there so i got a little

682
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
the chests up there so i got a little
 

683
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,790
the chests up there so i got a little
lucky we haven't

684
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
lucky we haven't
 

685
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,430
lucky we haven't
had enough to make five blocks which uh

686
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
had enough to make five blocks which uh
 

687
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,710
had enough to make five blocks which uh
should be enough to get going here

688
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
should be enough to get going here
 

689
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,990
should be enough to get going here
anyway

690
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
anyway
 

691
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,509
anyway
so i'm gonna put put some packed ice

692
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
so i'm gonna put put some packed ice
 

693
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,430
so i'm gonna put put some packed ice
down over here

694
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
down over here
 

695
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,030
down over here
and make the blazes get launched to the

696
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
and make the blazes get launched to the
 

697
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,790
and make the blazes get launched to the
side

698
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
side
 

699
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,350
side
how far does it go i i measured this all

700
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
how far does it go i i measured this all
 

701
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,790
how far does it go i i measured this all
out in creative already so i kind of

702
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
out in creative already so i kind of
 

703
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,870
out in creative already so i kind of
figured out some of the mechanics

704
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
figured out some of the mechanics
 

705
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,310
figured out some of the mechanics
because otherwise this is going to be

706
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
because otherwise this is going to be
 

707
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,949
because otherwise this is going to be
really time consuming to do the trial

708
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
really time consuming to do the trial
 

709
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,790
really time consuming to do the trial
and error with the blazes

710
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
and error with the blazes
 

711
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,949
and error with the blazes
yeah okay so then we have another slime

712
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
yeah okay so then we have another slime
 

713
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,750
yeah okay so then we have another slime
block launcher going up over here

714
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
block launcher going up over here
 

715
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,030
block launcher going up over here
uh to get this going i'm going to put

716
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
uh to get this going i'm going to put
 

717
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,750
uh to get this going i'm going to put
some stan

718
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
some stan
 

719
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,030
some stan
sandstone over here and then

720
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
sandstone over here and then
 

721
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,550
sandstone over here and then
redstone break this stuff i feel bad

722
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
redstone break this stuff i feel bad
 

723
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,150
redstone break this stuff i feel bad
breaking this but

724
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
breaking this but
 

725
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,110
breaking this but
you know it it was annoying too having

726
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
you know it it was annoying too having
 

727
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,389
you know it it was annoying too having
this run all the time this

728
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399
this run all the time this
 

729
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,030
this run all the time this
this way there's going to be no clocks i

730
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
this way there's going to be no clocks i
 

731
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,629
this way there's going to be no clocks i
don't like clocks i want to get rid of

732
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
don't like clocks i want to get rid of
 

733
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,350
don't like clocks i want to get rid of
them

734
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
them
 

735
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,990
them
if we can actually let's do it like this

736
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
if we can actually let's do it like this
 

737
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,670
if we can actually let's do it like this
yeah okay so there's gonna be a pressure

738
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
yeah okay so there's gonna be a pressure
 

739
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,829
yeah okay so there's gonna be a pressure
plate right over here

740
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
plate right over here
 

741
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,670
plate right over here
they changed the graphic on this too by

742
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
they changed the graphic on this too by
 

743
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,350
they changed the graphic on this too by
the way it looks super thin now doesn't

744
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
the way it looks super thin now doesn't
 

745
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,030
the way it looks super thin now doesn't
it

746
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
it
 

747
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,829
it
ow okay so they'll fall down when they

748
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
ow okay so they'll fall down when they
 

749
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,550
ow okay so they'll fall down when they
hit the pressure plate

750
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
hit the pressure plate
 

751
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,150
hit the pressure plate
yeah they'll get launched to the side

752
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
yeah they'll get launched to the side
 

753
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,110
yeah they'll get launched to the side
ice makes it slippery so they keep going

754
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
ice makes it slippery so they keep going
 

755
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,990
ice makes it slippery so they keep going
then they get to this one i'm gonna add

756
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
then they get to this one i'm gonna add
 

757
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,069
then they get to this one i'm gonna add
one more

758
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
one more
 

759
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,990
one more
pressure plate to the the dealio here

760
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
pressure plate to the the dealio here
 

761
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,230
pressure plate to the the dealio here
okay when they activate this

762
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240

 

763
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,829

i'm going to make this slime block

764
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
i'm going to make this slime block
 

765
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,750
i'm going to make this slime block
launcher go up

766
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
launcher go up
 

767
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,910
launcher go up
and then another sideways one

768
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
and then another sideways one
 

769
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,750
and then another sideways one
uh probably around here

770
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760

 

771
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,069

yeah so they'll get they'll get shot up

772
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
yeah so they'll get they'll get shot up
 

773
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,590
yeah so they'll get they'll get shot up
and then to the side

774
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
and then to the side
 

775
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,910
and then to the side
and it'll make like a nice little arc

776
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
and it'll make like a nice little arc
 

777
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,470
and it'll make like a nice little arc
should look pretty cool

778
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
should look pretty cool
 

779
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,269
should look pretty cool
uh let me do a little bit of finishing

780
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
uh let me do a little bit of finishing
 

781
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,629
uh let me do a little bit of finishing
here

782
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639

 

783
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,310

you get where i'm going with this now

784
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
you get where i'm going with this now
 

785
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,550
you get where i'm going with this now
don't you this is either going to be

786
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
don't you this is either going to be
 

787
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,990
don't you this is either going to be
really cool or

788
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
really cool or
 

789
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,310
really cool or
it's going to be a big bust i'm not sure

790
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
it's going to be a big bust i'm not sure
 

791
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,710
it's going to be a big bust i'm not sure
what the blazes are going to do exactly

792
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
what the blazes are going to do exactly
 

793
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,310
what the blazes are going to do exactly
if they're going to cooperate or if

794
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
if they're going to cooperate or if
 

795
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,509
if they're going to cooperate or if
they're going to

796
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
they're going to
 

797
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,350
they're going to
like make this a royal pain in

798
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
like make this a royal pain in
 

799
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,389
like make this a royal pain in
in the booty but we will see the idea is

800
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
in the booty but we will see the idea is
 

801
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,470
in the booty but we will see the idea is
though they should fall down here

802
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
though they should fall down here
 

803
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,910
though they should fall down here
hit the pressure plate slime block

804
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
hit the pressure plate slime block
 

805
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,829
hit the pressure plate slime block
launches them sideways

806
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
launches them sideways
 

807
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,150
launches them sideways
uh they trigger another pressure plate

808
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
uh they trigger another pressure plate
 

809
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,550
uh they trigger another pressure plate
then this shoots up they shoot sideways

810
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
then this shoots up they shoot sideways
 

811
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,670
then this shoots up they shoot sideways
they'll do a

812
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
they'll do a
 

813
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,110
they'll do a
fly through mid air hopefully if they

814
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
fly through mid air hopefully if they
 

815
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,389
fly through mid air hopefully if they
don't like that if they try to pass

816
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
don't like that if they try to pass
 

817
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,110
don't like that if they try to pass
towards us then we'll need to put up

818
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
towards us then we'll need to put up
 

819
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,670
towards us then we'll need to put up
glass

820
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
glass
 

821
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,389
glass
to to stop that so they can't see us

822
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
to to stop that so they can't see us
 

823
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,990
to to stop that so they can't see us
otherwise uh

824
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
otherwise uh
 

825
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,710
otherwise uh
they'll fly through midair land on this

826
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
they'll fly through midair land on this
 

827
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,470
they'll fly through midair land on this
one over here

828
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
one over here
 

829
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,670
one over here
and then we need some kind of a backing

830
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
and then we need some kind of a backing
 

831
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,990
and then we need some kind of a backing
just so that they don't uh

832
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
just so that they don't uh
 

833
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,710
just so that they don't uh
keep moving they need to to stop

834
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
keep moving they need to to stop
 

835
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,030
keep moving they need to to stop
completely here

836
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
completely here
 

837
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,389
completely here
so otherwise they might go into this

838
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
so otherwise they might go into this
 

839
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,470
so otherwise they might go into this
block over here like one further

840
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
block over here like one further
 

841
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,430
block over here like one further
let's get rid of this put some sandstone

842
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
let's get rid of this put some sandstone
 

843
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,230
let's get rid of this put some sandstone
whoops

844
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
whoops
 

845
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,670
whoops
over here okay so they shoot up and then

846
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
over here okay so they shoot up and then
 

847
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,069
over here okay so they shoot up and then
this is going to push them sideways and

848
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
this is going to push them sideways and
 

849
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,350
this is going to push them sideways and
then this is going to shoot them up

850
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
then this is going to shoot them up
 

851
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,230
then this is going to shoot them up
one last time and um

852
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240

 

853
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,389

then i plan on putting an ice stream

854
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
then i plan on putting an ice stream
 

855
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,629
then i plan on putting an ice stream
over here

856
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639

 

857
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,910

i don't know if this is the right height

858
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
i don't know if this is the right height
 

859
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,430
i don't know if this is the right height
i'll have to experiment with this a bit

860
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
i'll have to experiment with this a bit
 

861
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,870
i'll have to experiment with this a bit
more

862
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
more
 

863
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,949
more
yeah they should go every time they get

864
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
yeah they should go every time they get
 

865
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,710
yeah they should go every time they get
shot sideways with this they seem to

866
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
shot sideways with this they seem to
 

867
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,949
shot sideways with this they seem to
travel about 10 to 11 blocks

868
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
travel about 10 to 11 blocks
 

869
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,790
travel about 10 to 11 blocks
from what i i could tell when i was in

870
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
from what i i could tell when i was in
 

871
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,949
from what i i could tell when i was in
creative

872
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
creative
 

873
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,069
creative
oh oh there's some wiring up there by

874
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
oh oh there's some wiring up there by
 

875
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,110
oh oh there's some wiring up there by
the way

876
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
the way
 

877
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,030
the way
that's that's what this is that's why

878
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
that's that's what this is that's why
 

879
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,790
that's that's what this is that's why
you use stone brick when you do uh

880
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
you use stone brick when you do uh
 

881
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,990
you use stone brick when you do uh
redstone guys

882
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
redstone guys
 

883
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,670
redstone guys
because when you're digging you might

884
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
because when you're digging you might
 

885
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,910
because when you're digging you might
accidentally run into it one day

886
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
accidentally run into it one day
 

887
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,590
accidentally run into it one day
that's the reason i do it

888
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
that's the reason i do it
 

889
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,069
that's the reason i do it
well if we're lucky it'll work there's a

890
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
well if we're lucky it'll work there's a
 

891
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,389
well if we're lucky it'll work there's a
lot of moving parts to this i realized

892
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399

 

893
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,230

that doesn't work for me let's hope that

894
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
that doesn't work for me let's hope that
 

895
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,389
that doesn't work for me let's hope that
works for the blazes

896
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
works for the blazes
 

897
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,029
works for the blazes
and then uh there's a second step here

898
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
and then uh there's a second step here
 

899
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,189
and then uh there's a second step here
so there's another tripwire

900
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
so there's another tripwire
 

901
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,590
so there's another tripwire
right and it goes down to here and

902
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
right and it goes down to here and
 

903
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,510
right and it goes down to here and
activates after two ticks that goes

904
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
activates after two ticks that goes
 

905
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,990
activates after two ticks that goes
up and then also have some redstone

906
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
up and then also have some redstone
 

907
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,990
up and then also have some redstone
torches running up to the top there

908
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
torches running up to the top there
 

909
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,789
torches running up to the top there
to that one for the sideways i think

910
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
to that one for the sideways i think
 

911
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,669
to that one for the sideways i think
that's one

912
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
that's one
 

913
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,110
that's one
two three four five six delay i guess

914
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
two three four five six delay i guess
 

915
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,510
two three four five six delay i guess
and then one more repeater from off of

916
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
and then one more repeater from off of
 

917
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,309
and then one more repeater from off of
this

918
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
this
 

919
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,270
this
goes to there and then the blaze should

920
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
goes to there and then the blaze should
 

921
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,070
goes to there and then the blaze should
get shot

922
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
get shot
 

923
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,710
get shot
up into the left and then i made like a

924
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
up into the left and then i made like a
 

925
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,310
up into the left and then i made like a
little basket in the middle there

926
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
little basket in the middle there
 

927
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,789
little basket in the middle there
which happens to be right in the center

928
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
which happens to be right in the center
 

929
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,750
which happens to be right in the center
of the two sides

930
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
of the two sides
 

931
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,669
of the two sides
funny how that all worked out right yeah

932
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
funny how that all worked out right yeah
 

933
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,430
funny how that all worked out right yeah
so this is the very middle and this is

934
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
so this is the very middle and this is
 

935
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,110
so this is the very middle and this is
where my basket is so that's what we're

936
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
where my basket is so that's what we're
 

937
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,150
where my basket is so that's what we're
trying to get into right there

938
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
trying to get into right there
 

939
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,270
trying to get into right there
let's see if this works this works

940
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
let's see if this works this works
 

941
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,789
let's see if this works this works
this part works for me

942
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799

 

943
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,470

boo perfect let's see if it works for

944
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
boo perfect let's see if it works for
 

945
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,830
boo perfect let's see if it works for
the blazes because they're another story

946
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
the blazes because they're another story
 

947
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,510
the blazes because they're another story
i'm a little worried because this first

948
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
i'm a little worried because this first
 

949
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,190
i'm a little worried because this first
part isn't working for

950
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
part isn't working for
 

951
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,150
part isn't working for
for me but in creative it seemed to work

952
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
for me but in creative it seemed to work
 

953
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,830
for me but in creative it seemed to work
for the blazes so we'll we'll see what

954
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
for the blazes so we'll we'll see what
 

955
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,110
for the blazes so we'll we'll see what
happens

956
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
happens
 

957
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,510
happens
okay let's go up we'll get this going

958
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
okay let's go up we'll get this going
 

959
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,630
okay let's go up we'll get this going
and hope for the best all right

960
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
and hope for the best all right
 

961
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,230
and hope for the best all right
and then we gotta redo the killing

962
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
and then we gotta redo the killing
 

963
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,470
and then we gotta redo the killing
chamber as well

964
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
chamber as well
 

965
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,470
chamber as well
okay turn this back on might take a

966
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
okay turn this back on might take a
 

967
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,590
okay turn this back on might take a
couple moments here oh right away

968
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
couple moments here oh right away
 

969
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,470
couple moments here oh right away
okay okay are you gonna do your thing

970
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480

 

971
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,230

take him a little time to get down wait

972
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
take him a little time to get down wait
 

973
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,110
take him a little time to get down wait
a minute why isn't he down yet

974
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
a minute why isn't he down yet
 

975
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,630
a minute why isn't he down yet
is it possible for them to get stuck on

976
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
is it possible for them to get stuck on
 

977
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,750
is it possible for them to get stuck on
this i thought uh

978
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760

 

979
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,270

i thought i worked out the details to

980
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
i thought i worked out the details to
 

981
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,470
i thought i worked out the details to
all that in the past

982
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480

 

983
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,830

oh man oh no he was short why was he

984
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
oh man oh no he was short why was he
 

985
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,549
oh man oh no he was short why was he
short

986
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559

 

987
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,310

see i can make this one why can't he

988
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
see i can make this one why can't he
 

989
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,070
see i can make this one why can't he
make the set one and he made the first

990
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
make the set one and he made the first
 

991
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,430
make the set one and he made the first
one but i couldn't make the first one

992
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
one but i couldn't make the first one
 

993
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,390
one but i couldn't make the first one
that is so weird

994
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400

 

995
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,990

all right do we have any more

996
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
all right do we have any more
 

997
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,110
all right do we have any more
i wanna see if another guy does it here

998
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
i wanna see if another guy does it here
 

999
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,789
i wanna see if another guy does it here
i'm gonna make a little uh barrier just

1000
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
i'm gonna make a little uh barrier just
 

1001
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,310
i'm gonna make a little uh barrier just
in case

1002
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
in case
 

1003
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,630
in case
i'm influencing their pathfinding or

1004
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
i'm influencing their pathfinding or
 

1005
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,150
i'm influencing their pathfinding or
something

1006
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160

 

1007
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,070

oh are they hitting their head oh that

1008
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
oh are they hitting their head oh that
 

1009
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,789
oh are they hitting their head oh that
might be what it is

1010
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
might be what it is
 

1011
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,390
might be what it is
okay let's shut this off for a second

1012
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
okay let's shut this off for a second
 

1013
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,669
okay let's shut this off for a second
i'm gonna remove a few more blocks here

1014
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679

 

1015
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,909

okay here comes one i cleared out the

1016
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
okay here comes one i cleared out the
 

1017
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,789
okay here comes one i cleared out the
blocks

1018
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
blocks
 

1019
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,150
blocks
so let's hope it's

1020
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
so let's hope it's
 

1021
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,549
so let's hope it's
oh yeah right in the basket nice

1022
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
oh yeah right in the basket nice
 

1023
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,909
oh yeah right in the basket nice
oh that's awesome it actually worked

1024
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
oh that's awesome it actually worked
 

1025
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,470
oh that's awesome it actually worked
now how how consistent is it is the next

1026
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
now how how consistent is it is the next
 

1027
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,950
now how how consistent is it is the next
question

1028
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
question
 

1029
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,350
question
let's try to get a few more going and

1030
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
let's try to get a few more going and
 

1031
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,950
let's try to get a few more going and
then i want to try to remove this

1032
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
then i want to try to remove this
 

1033
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,150
then i want to try to remove this
this barrier so they can actually see me

1034
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
this barrier so they can actually see me
 

1035
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,669
this barrier so they can actually see me
and see if that affects their movement

1036
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
and see if that affects their movement
 

1037
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,590
and see if that affects their movement
ideally i would just like them to free

1038
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
ideally i would just like them to free
 

1039
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,029
ideally i would just like them to free
fly through the air

1040
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
fly through the air
 

1041
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,190
fly through the air
but if they pass fine to me might make

1042
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
but if they pass fine to me might make
 

1043
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,390
but if they pass fine to me might make
things a little different

1044
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400

 

1045
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,870

oh actually i'm gonna go out just

1046
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
oh actually i'm gonna go out just
 

1047
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,549
oh actually i'm gonna go out just
because we can't see down there

1048
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559

 

1049
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,149

so we gotta do the same on the other

1050
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
so we gotta do the same on the other
 

1051
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,070
so we gotta do the same on the other
side as well

1052
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
side as well
 

1053
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,430
side as well
and then in the middle there that's

1054
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
and then in the middle there that's
 

1055
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,029
and then in the middle there that's
where the new killing chamber is gonna

1056
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
where the new killing chamber is gonna
 

1057
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,390
where the new killing chamber is gonna
be

1058
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400

 

1059
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,390

any more now one problem we might have

1060
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
any more now one problem we might have
 

1061
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,870
any more now one problem we might have
though is

1062
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
though is
 

1063
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,470
though is
if we're shooting one to the left and

1064
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
if we're shooting one to the left and
 

1065
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,549
if we're shooting one to the left and
one at the right and they meet

1066
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
one at the right and they meet
 

1067
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,390
one at the right and they meet
together at the middle at the exact same

1068
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
together at the middle at the exact same
 

1069
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,669
together at the middle at the exact same
time they might

1070
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
time they might
 

1071
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,390
time they might
bump each other and not fall down there

1072
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
bump each other and not fall down there
 

1073
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,070
bump each other and not fall down there
i'm not sure

1074
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080

 

1075
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,950

we'll have to test that out too

1076
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960

 

1077
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,710

this was a big problem in the past

1078
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
this was a big problem in the past
 

1079
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,470
this was a big problem in the past
because the only way of moving mobs in

1080
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
because the only way of moving mobs in
 

1081
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,590
because the only way of moving mobs in
the

1082
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
the
 

1083
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,789
the
nether was like mine carts and pistons

1084
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
nether was like mine carts and pistons
 

1085
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,789
nether was like mine carts and pistons
and we didn't have slime blocks and

1086
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
and we didn't have slime blocks and
 

1087
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,470
and we didn't have slime blocks and
packed ice in the past

1088
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
packed ice in the past
 

1089
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,909
packed ice in the past
i don't even think we had upside down

1090
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
i don't even think we had upside down
 

1091
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,750
i don't even think we had upside down
stairs when i built this before because

1092
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
stairs when i built this before because
 

1093
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,950
stairs when i built this before because
i didn't use any in the design here

1094
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
i didn't use any in the design here
 

1095
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,630
i didn't use any in the design here
so a lot of stuff has changed in the

1096
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
so a lot of stuff has changed in the
 

1097
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,070
so a lot of stuff has changed in the
game since uh

1098
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
game since uh
 

1099
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,990
game since uh
since i built this didn't have hoppers

1100
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
since i built this didn't have hoppers
 

1101
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,390
since i built this didn't have hoppers
and all that kind of stuff

1102
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400

 

1103
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,630

okay that guy saw me he was on fire

1104
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640

 

1105
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,909

oh yeah if they see me

1106
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
oh yeah if they see me
 

1107
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,110
oh yeah if they see me
we have trouble oh oh okay i'm getting

1108
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
we have trouble oh oh okay i'm getting
 

1109
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,029
we have trouble oh oh okay i'm getting
out of here

1110
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
out of here
 

1111
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,390
out of here
turn this off and run

1112
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400

 

1113
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,390

very good so i got the other side hooked

1114
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
very good so i got the other side hooked
 

1115
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,310
very good so i got the other side hooked
up now both sides are hooked up

1116
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
up now both sides are hooked up
 

1117
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,710
up now both sides are hooked up
and should meet in the middle haven't

1118
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
and should meet in the middle haven't
 

1119
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,230
and should meet in the middle haven't
tried it yet

1120
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
tried it yet
 

1121
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,230
tried it yet
but i want to show you the plan for the

1122
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
but i want to show you the plan for the
 

1123
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,430
but i want to show you the plan for the
killing chamber we're running a little

1124
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
killing chamber we're running a little
 

1125
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,710
killing chamber we're running a little
low on time

1126
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
low on time
 

1127
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,750
low on time
so let's go through this pretty quick uh

1128
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
so let's go through this pretty quick uh
 

1129
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,270
so let's go through this pretty quick uh
they're going to fall into this first

1130
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
they're going to fall into this first
 

1131
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,430
they're going to fall into this first
part right what i want to actually do is

1132
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
part right what i want to actually do is
 

1133
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,830
part right what i want to actually do is
have a piston

1134
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
have a piston
 

1135
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,510
have a piston
around here do a sticky piston thing

1136
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
around here do a sticky piston thing
 

1137
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,350
around here do a sticky piston thing
all right so that what that can extend

1138
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
all right so that what that can extend
 

1139
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,549
all right so that what that can extend
and retract

1140
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
and retract
 

1141
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,430
and retract
to either allow them to fall through or

1142
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
to either allow them to fall through or
 

1143
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,270
to either allow them to fall through or
or stay there

1144
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
or stay there
 

1145
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,190
or stay there
then we're gonna have the actual tilling

1146
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
then we're gonna have the actual tilling
 

1147
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,870
then we're gonna have the actual tilling
chamber two

1148
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
chamber two
 

1149
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,990
chamber two
two blocks below that

1150
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
two blocks below that
 

1151
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,430
two blocks below that
and let's put this here for right now

1152
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
and let's put this here for right now
 

1153
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,470
and let's put this here for right now
okay so they're gonna fall into this

1154
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
okay so they're gonna fall into this
 

1155
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,070
okay so they're gonna fall into this
area here

1156
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
area here
 

1157
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,310
area here
then what i'd i experimented with this

1158
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
then what i'd i experimented with this
 

1159
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,830
then what i'd i experimented with this
in the creative world a little bit it

1160
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
in the creative world a little bit it
 

1161
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,510
in the creative world a little bit it
seems like it's going to work

1162
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
seems like it's going to work
 

1163
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,750
seems like it's going to work
what i want to do is grab some iron

1164
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
what i want to do is grab some iron
 

1165
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,230
what i want to do is grab some iron
i've never done this i wanted to do this

1166
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
i've never done this i wanted to do this
 

1167
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,990
i've never done this i wanted to do this
since they came out we're actually

1168
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
since they came out we're actually
 

1169
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,149
since they came out we're actually
gonna use an iron pressure plates

1170
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
gonna use an iron pressure plates
 

1171
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,510
gonna use an iron pressure plates
shocking i know they actually have a

1172
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
shocking i know they actually have a
 

1173
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,310
shocking i know they actually have a
purpose

1174
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
purpose
 

1175
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,270
purpose
believe it or not they're not just for

1176
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
believe it or not they're not just for
 

1177
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,230
believe it or not they're not just for
looks

1178
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
looks
 

1179
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,149
looks
you can use them for some redstone

1180
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
you can use them for some redstone
 

1181
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,510
you can use them for some redstone
things

1182
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
things
 

1183
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,070
things
so these detect entities right so the

1184
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
so these detect entities right so the
 

1185
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,549
so these detect entities right so the
more entities you got on these

1186
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
more entities you got on these
 

1187
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,549
more entities you got on these
the iron and the gold the farther the

1188
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
the iron and the gold the farther the
 

1189
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,350
the iron and the gold the farther the
redstone signal travels

1190
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
redstone signal travels
 

1191
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,310
redstone signal travels
so i worked out some of the the details

1192
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
so i worked out some of the the details
 

1193
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,270
so i worked out some of the the details
to this

1194
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
to this
 

1195
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,149
to this
to go from level 30 to level 33 to do

1196
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
to go from level 30 to level 33 to do
 

1197
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,669
to go from level 30 to level 33 to do
one enchantment

1198
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
one enchantment
 

1199
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,149
one enchantment
you need to kill 37 blazes

1200
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
you need to kill 37 blazes
 

1201
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,350
you need to kill 37 blazes
okay and

1202
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
okay and
 

1203
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,710
okay and
let's see can we do this let's try to do

1204
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
let's see can we do this let's try to do
 

1205
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,029
let's see can we do this let's try to do
this

1206
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
this
 

1207
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,310
this
okay so i think if i just

1208
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
okay so i think if i just
 

1209
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,070
okay so i think if i just
throw items on it it should do the same

1210
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
throw items on it it should do the same
 

1211
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,630
throw items on it it should do the same
thing right

1212
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
thing right
 

1213
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,430
thing right
okay let's get some redstone down one

1214
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
okay let's get some redstone down one
 

1215
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,310
okay let's get some redstone down one
two three four

1216
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
two three four
 

1217
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,830
two three four
five to show you what happens here

1218
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
five to show you what happens here
 

1219
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,830
five to show you what happens here
get the lights so we can visualize it a

1220
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
get the lights so we can visualize it a
 

1221
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,909
get the lights so we can visualize it a
little better okay so we're gonna throw

1222
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
little better okay so we're gonna throw
 

1223
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,590
little better okay so we're gonna throw
i have 50 stone on me right now

1224
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
i have 50 stone on me right now
 

1225
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,190
i have 50 stone on me right now
so it goes one block

1226
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200

 

1227
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,830

and that is 25 30.

1228
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
and that is 25 30.
 

1229
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,390
and that is 25 30.
oh okay we might actually have to use

1230
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
oh okay we might actually have to use
 

1231
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,190
oh okay we might actually have to use
blazes

1232
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
blazes
 

1233
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,390
blazes
this is not working oh yeah it's only

1234
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
this is not working oh yeah it's only
 

1235
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,909
this is not working oh yeah it's only
counting as one entity when they group

1236
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
counting as one entity when they group
 

1237
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,549
counting as one entity when they group
up like that it's only one that's right

1238
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
up like that it's only one that's right
 

1239
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,630
up like that it's only one that's right
so anyways once we get to 41 blazes it

1240
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
so anyways once we get to 41 blazes it
 

1241
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,950
so anyways once we get to 41 blazes it
travels to the fifth block here so

1242
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
travels to the fifth block here so
 

1243
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,669
travels to the fifth block here so
up to here which is four extra blazes

1244
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
up to here which is four extra blazes
 

1245
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,590
up to here which is four extra blazes
than we need but it should be

1246
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
than we need but it should be
 

1247
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,310
than we need but it should be
should be fine we can calculate kind of

1248
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
should be fine we can calculate kind of
 

1249
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,149
should be fine we can calculate kind of
how many we need to kill to do

1250
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
how many we need to kill to do
 

1251
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,750
how many we need to kill to do
one enchantment and once this

1252
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
one enchantment and once this
 

1253
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,710
one enchantment and once this
triggers this iron pressure plate i want

1254
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
triggers this iron pressure plate i want
 

1255
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,190
triggers this iron pressure plate i want
this piston to extend to stop anymore

1256
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
this piston to extend to stop anymore
 

1257
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,470
this piston to extend to stop anymore
from coming down

1258
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
from coming down
 

1259
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,110
from coming down
they'll start grouping up here right i

1260
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
they'll start grouping up here right i
 

1261
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,470
they'll start grouping up here right i
want to automatically

1262
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
want to automatically
 

1263
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,830
want to automatically
trigger a crushing system as well

1264
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
trigger a crushing system as well
 

1265
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,269
trigger a crushing system as well
so we don't even have to press a button

1266
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
so we don't even have to press a button
 

1267
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,269
so we don't even have to press a button
or anything to activate it with this

1268
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
or anything to activate it with this
 

1269
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,750
or anything to activate it with this
design it'll all be automatic

1270
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760

 

1271
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,750

cool so i think i got this up and

1272
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
cool so i think i got this up and
 

1273
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,269
cool so i think i got this up and
running we're gonna get some blazes

1274
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
running we're gonna get some blazes
 

1275
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,510
running we're gonna get some blazes
flowing here and we'll see

1276
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
flowing here and we'll see
 

1277
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,870
flowing here and we'll see
what happens

1278
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880

 

1279
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,070

hopefully they don't see me it's gonna

1280
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
hopefully they don't see me it's gonna
 

1281
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,710
hopefully they don't see me it's gonna
put up a wall for right now

1282
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
put up a wall for right now
 

1283
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,269
put up a wall for right now
just so i don't mess up the results here

1284
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
just so i don't mess up the results here
 

1285
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,549
just so i don't mess up the results here
we're gonna have to tear this down

1286
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
we're gonna have to tear this down
 

1287
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,549
we're gonna have to tear this down
unfortunately

1288
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
unfortunately
 

1289
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,590
unfortunately
let's build it a little higher too

1290
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
let's build it a little higher too
 

1291
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,789
let's build it a little higher too
oh i'm out okay so i want to make sure

1292
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
oh i'm out okay so i want to make sure
 

1293
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,070
oh i'm out okay so i want to make sure
this left side works

1294
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
this left side works
 

1295
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,190
this left side works
first off um i'm going to try watch it

1296
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
first off um i'm going to try watch it
 

1297
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,430
first off um i'm going to try watch it
to see what happens if they collide in

1298
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
to see what happens if they collide in
 

1299
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,110
to see what happens if they collide in
the middle there too

1300
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
the middle there too
 

1301
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,789
the middle there too
that might happen this thing's kind of

1302
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
that might happen this thing's kind of
 

1303
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,390
that might happen this thing's kind of
in the way right now though

1304
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
in the way right now though
 

1305
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,430
in the way right now though
it's going down we're getting rid of it

1306
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
it's going down we're getting rid of it
 

1307
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,909
it's going down we're getting rid of it
i hate to do it oh yeah lava lava

you break it you
put a block in the place and it's gone

1320
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960

 

1321
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,830

you gotta be really careful in the

1322

oh so they're trying to go
left so pathfinding is messing something

1508
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:20,840
left so pathfinding is messing something
 

1509
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,269
left so pathfinding is messing something
up

1510
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
up
 

1511
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,870
up
oh now we got in that guy's way

1512

oh now we got in that guy's way
 

1513
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,430
oh now we got in that guy's way
we're gonna have to fine tune this guys

1514
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
we're gonna have to fine tune this guys
 

1515
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,950
we're gonna have to fine tune this guys
we can't just let them do whatever they

1516
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
we can't just let them do whatever they
 

1517
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,470
we can't just let them do whatever they
want it looks like because they will

1518
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
want it looks like because they will
 

1519
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,470
want it looks like because they will
mess it up

1520
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
mess it up
 

1521
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,789
mess it up
all right so the way it's set up right

1522
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:36,799
all right so the way it's set up right
 

1523
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,750
all right so the way it's set up right
now if we get

1524
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
now if we get
 

1525
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,950
now if we get
41 blazes in there this thing should

1526
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
41 blazes in there this thing should
 

1527
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,710
41 blazes in there this thing should
uh automatically trigger

1528
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720

 

1529
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,870

oh they did bump did you see that

1530
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:50,880
oh they did bump did you see that
 

1531
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,990
oh they did bump did you see that
no

1532
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000

 

1533
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,750

oh yeah pushed in at least

1534
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760

 

1535
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,590

oh okay there it goes the crusher

1536
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
oh okay there it goes the crusher
 

1537
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,350
oh okay there it goes the crusher
activated automatically

1538
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360

 

1539
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,710

oh and i had it for too long darn it

1540
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
oh and i had it for too long darn it
 

1541
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,470
oh and i had it for too long darn it
but once once they all die like if i

1542
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
but once once they all die like if i
 

1543
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,230
but once once they all die like if i
threw a damaged potion on them

1544
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
threw a damaged potion on them
 

1545
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,070
threw a damaged potion on them
then uh the thing that stops them from

1546
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
then uh the thing that stops them from
 

1547
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,590
then uh the thing that stops them from
falling down their tracks as well

1548
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
falling down their tracks as well
 

1549
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,029
falling down their tracks as well
automatically so then

1550
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:31,039
automatically so then
 

1551
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,909
automatically so then
the next load will start to fall down so

1552
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
the next load will start to fall down so
 

1553
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,830
the next load will start to fall down so
that means i can have

1554
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
that means i can have
 

1555
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,389
that means i can have
like an enchantment worth down at the

1556
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
like an enchantment worth down at the
 

1557
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,590
like an enchantment worth down at the
bottom

1558
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
bottom
 

1559
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,430
bottom
and then they'll start to accumulate at

1560
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
and then they'll start to accumulate at
 

1561
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,590
and then they'll start to accumulate at
the top there

1562
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
the top there
 

1563
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,029
the top there
and it's not until i kill the ones at

1564
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
and it's not until i kill the ones at
 

1565
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,110
and it's not until i kill the ones at
the bottom that the top ones get sent

1566
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
the bottom that the top ones get sent
 

1567
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,909
the bottom that the top ones get sent
down

1568
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
down
 

1569
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,470
down
so it might be pretty cool we got a few

1570
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
so it might be pretty cool we got a few
 

1571
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,830
so it might be pretty cool we got a few
problems going on here though because

to move now that side got totally messed
up

1580
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559

snapshots
currently i'm using 15 w35e which is not

1610
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
currently i'm using 15 w35e which is not
 

1611
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,990
currently i'm using 15 w35e which is not
affected i'm going to wait a while

1612
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
affected i'm going to wait a while
 

1613
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,269
affected i'm going to wait a while
before i update uh i want to make sure

because i don't want to fix
 

1619
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,630
because i don't want to fix
my elevators in this world and then you

1620
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
my elevators in this world and then you
 

1621
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,230
my elevators in this world and then you
know they make another change and then i

1622
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
know they make another change and then i
 

1623
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,710
know they make another change and then i
gotta

1624
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720

little bit for that to settle down

1628
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
little bit for that to settle down
 

1629
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,230
little bit for that to settle down
uh i got about 10 to 20 of those

1630
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
uh i got about 10 to 20 of those
 

1631
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,310
uh i got about 10 to 20 of those
elevators in my world that i'll have to

1632
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
elevators in my world that i'll have to
 

1633
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,389
elevators in my world that i'll have to
fix

1634
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
fix
 

1635
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,750
fix
but it's probably going to be as simple

1636
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
but it's probably going to be as simple
 

1637
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,990
but it's probably going to be as simple
as adding a piston and and whatever

1638
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
as adding a piston and and whatever
 

1639
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,029
as adding a piston and and whatever
maybe a little bit of circuitry i don't

1640
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
maybe a little bit of circuitry i don't
 

1641
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,549
maybe a little bit of circuitry i don't
think it's gonna be too complicated it's

1642
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
think it's gonna be too complicated it's
 

1643
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,070
think it's gonna be too complicated it's
gonna be a pain to go

1644
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
gonna be a pain to go
 

1645
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,230
gonna be a pain to go
around my world and do all that but

1646
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
around my world and do all that but
 

1647
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,509
around my world and do all that but
it's gotta be done so uh

1648
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:21,519
it's gotta be done so uh
 

1649
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,830
it's gotta be done so uh
