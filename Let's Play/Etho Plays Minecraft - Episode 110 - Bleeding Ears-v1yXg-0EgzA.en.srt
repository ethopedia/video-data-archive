00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,070
nine now it's 11 by 11 so two extra
blocks there and there's the waters too

164
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
blocks there and there's the waters too
 

165
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:55,590
blocks there and there's the waters too
deep here so let's let's check it out

166
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:55,600

 

167
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,370

not in the right spot there we go and we

168
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:03,380
not in the right spot there we go and we
 

169
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,969
not in the right spot there we go and we
have a cow up here just like that now I

170
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:06,979
have a cow up here just like that now I
 

171
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:12,100
have a cow up here just like that now I
need to hook up some way of processing

172
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,110
need to hook up some way of processing
 

173
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,750
need to hook up some way of processing
them I'll say so one idea was to have

174
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:16,760
them I'll say so one idea was to have
 

175
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,620
them I'll say so one idea was to have
them drop into some lava above me when

176
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:20,630
them drop into some lava above me when
 

177
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,589
them drop into some lava above me when
I'm standing in the center here but that

178
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
I'm standing in the center here but that
 

179
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,890
I'm standing in the center here but that
will be hard to set up so I think I'll

180
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:26,900
will be hard to set up so I think I'll
 

181
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,390
will be hard to set up so I think I'll
do something simpler and thinking either

182
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:31,400
do something simpler and thinking either
 

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,250
do something simpler and thinking either
an EMP unit or something like that not

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,260
an EMP unit or something like that not
 

185
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,380
an EMP unit or something like that not
sure

186
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,390
sure
 

187
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,920
sure
oh yeah one other thing people have told

188
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:41,930
oh yeah one other thing people have told
 

189
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,959
oh yeah one other thing people have told
me I have my brightness way too high and

190
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:43,969
me I have my brightness way too high and
 

191
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,410
me I have my brightness way too high and
I definitely agree I've had it at a

192
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,420
I definitely agree I've had it at a
 

193
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,370
I definitely agree I've had it at a
hundred percent this whole time or plus

194
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:51,380
hundred percent this whole time or plus
 

195
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,860
hundred percent this whole time or plus
a hundred so tell me what you think it

196
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:53,870
a hundred so tell me what you think it
 

197
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,480
a hundred so tell me what you think it
looks good we'll go down to 75 now a

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,490
looks good we'll go down to 75 now a
 

199
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,639
looks good we'll go down to 75 now a
little bit more natural I'm thinking

200
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:00,649
little bit more natural I'm thinking
 

201
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,340
little bit more natural I'm thinking
around 50 is gonna be great for YouTube

202
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,350
around 50 is gonna be great for YouTube
 

203
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,860
around 50 is gonna be great for YouTube
it'll still have that light quality

204
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,870
it'll still have that light quality
 

205
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,380
it'll still have that light quality
without it being too dark

206
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:11,390
without it being too dark
 

207
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,660
without it being too dark
let's go down more though just so we can

208
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,670
let's go down more though just so we can
 

209
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,810
let's go down more though just so we can
see tell me which you think looks best 5

210
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:19,820
see tell me which you think looks best 5
 

211

see tell me which you think looks best 5
and this is what it is really supposed

212
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:22,339
and this is what it is really supposed
 

213
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,860
and this is what it is really supposed
to look like it is really dark down here

214
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:26,870
to look like it is really dark down here
 

215
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,009
to look like it is really dark down here
apparently I had no idea cool

216
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:33,019
apparently I had no idea cool
 

217
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,079
apparently I had no idea cool
okay well I'll go up to 50 for this

218
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:35,089
okay well I'll go up to 50 for this
 

219
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,460
okay well I'll go up to 50 for this
episode anyway and I'll show you what

220
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,470
episode anyway and I'll show you what
 

221
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,590
episode anyway and I'll show you what
I've done here I've added pumpkins in

222
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,600
I've done here I've added pumpkins in
 

223
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,800
I've done here I've added pumpkins in
the middle for lights I've also hidden

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:47,810
the middle for lights I've also hidden
 

225
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,259
the middle for lights I've also hidden
them behind these leaves that added

226
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:50,269
them behind these leaves that added
 

227
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,250
them behind these leaves that added
these leaves and bumped him back there

228
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,260
these leaves and bumped him back there
 

229
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,740
these leaves and bumped him back there
glowing pumpkin one back there so

230
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:56,750
glowing pumpkin one back there so
 

231
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,519
glowing pumpkin one back there so
there's eight all around and I believe

232
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:00,529
there's eight all around and I believe
 

233
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,500
there's eight all around and I believe
what I am going to do with the cows is

234
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,510
what I am going to do with the cows is
 

235
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,750
what I am going to do with the cows is
just set up some half slabs all around

236
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:04,760
just set up some half slabs all around
 

237
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,460
just set up some half slabs all around
here the old school type or something

238
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,470
here the old school type or something
 

239
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:22,269
here the old school type or something
different and then let's see we'll have

240
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:22,279
different and then let's see we'll have
 

241
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,540
different and then let's see we'll have
water pushing them to these edges the

242
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:25,550
water pushing them to these edges the
 

243
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,970
water pushing them to these edges the
cows then they'll fall down to this ring

244
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:30,980
cows then they'll fall down to this ring
 

245
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,280
cows then they'll fall down to this ring
all around they won't be able to get out

246
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,290
all around they won't be able to get out
 

247
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,060
all around they won't be able to get out
and then I'll choose one spot to hook up

248
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,070
and then I'll choose one spot to hook up
 

249
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,860
and then I'll choose one spot to hook up
a killing thing yeah and they'll just

250
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:44,870
a killing thing yeah and they'll just
 

251
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,410
a killing thing yeah and they'll just
wander into it on their own eventually

252
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,420
wander into it on their own eventually
 

253
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,980
wander into it on their own eventually
does it have to be

254
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:48,990
does it have to be
 

255
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,790
does it have to be
super automated it's just the basic farm

256
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800

 

257
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,100

okay so the water is going to be a

258
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,110
okay so the water is going to be a
 

259
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,389
okay so the water is going to be a
little tricky I will put some more

260
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
little tricky I will put some more
 

261
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,840
little tricky I will put some more
leaves here leaves maybe now let's do

262
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:08,850
leaves here leaves maybe now let's do
 

263
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:20,030
leaves here leaves maybe now let's do
glass some glass and then I got four

264
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,040
glass some glass and then I got four
 

265
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,139
glass some glass and then I got four
buckets on me good I will put these at

266
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,149
buckets on me good I will put these at
 

267
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,190
buckets on me good I will put these at
each of these points to push your cows

268
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,200
each of these points to push your cows
 

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,210
each of these points to push your cows
towards the edges I really wanted to

270
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,220
towards the edges I really wanted to
 

271
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,710
towards the edges I really wanted to

280
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,460

 

281
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,220

okay my water is back there yeah and

282
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,230
okay my water is back there yeah and
 

283
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,010
okay my water is back there yeah and
I'll just have a block and a half height

284
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,020
I'll just have a block and a half height
 

285
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll just have a block and a half height
clearance here so only towels will fit

286
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,330
clearance here so only towels will fit
 

287
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,980
clearance here so only towels will fit
through and I won't because I don't

288
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:11,990
through and I won't because I don't
 

289
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,450
through and I won't because I don't
wanna get trapped down here and grab

290
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:16,460
wanna get trapped down here and grab
 

291
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,730
wanna get trapped down here and grab
some water

292
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:17,740
some water
 

293
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,350
some water
this here temporarily and now we need to

294
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
this here temporarily and now we need to
 

295
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,210
this here temporarily and now we need to
update our water so that's a little bit

296
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,220
update our water so that's a little bit
 

297
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,970
update our water so that's a little bit
of a pain but basically if we pour water

298
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:27,980
of a pain but basically if we pour water
 

299
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,190
of a pain but basically if we pour water
next to it and then make it disappear

300
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:30,200
next to it and then make it disappear
 

301
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:38,250
next to it and then make it disappear
not thing I feel we can get it to spread

302
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:38,260

 

303
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,560

like so and then we can make it take

304
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,570
like so and then we can make it take
 

305
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:51,280
like so and then we can make it take
shape leg going on here so I'll do that

306
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,290
shape leg going on here so I'll do that
 

307
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,040
shape leg going on here so I'll do that
I'll see you in a second there we are

whole ceiling and I'll just have a

316
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,100
whole ceiling and I'll just have a
 

317
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,220
whole ceiling and I'll just have a
little chute that I can walk in above
