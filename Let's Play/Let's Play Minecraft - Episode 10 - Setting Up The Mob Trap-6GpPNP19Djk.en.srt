1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,999

hey everyone we're at episode 10 already

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:04,009
hey everyone we're at episode 10 already
 

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,210
hey everyone we're at episode 10 already
time is just flying and I've been

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,220
time is just flying and I've been
 

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,370
time is just flying and I've been
working on the mob trap relentlessly or

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:12,380
working on the mob trap relentlessly or
 

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,910
working on the mob trap relentlessly or
over the last three days now and let's

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
over the last three days now and let's
 

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,599
over the last three days now and let's
go check it out

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:22,609

 

11
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,950

I've pretty much only been doing grunt

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
I've pretty much only been doing grunt
 

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,880
I've pretty much only been doing grunt
work nothing nothing interesting really

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:30,890

 

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,160

so yeah like I said before there's this

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,170
so yeah like I said before there's this
 

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,600
so yeah like I said before there's this
higher level mistake I made and I wasn't

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,610
higher level mistake I made and I wasn't
 

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,310
higher level mistake I made and I wasn't
very clear but this is actually a

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
very clear but this is actually a
 

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,119
very clear but this is actually a
randomly generated lava pool and I

22
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,129
randomly generated lava pool and I
 

23
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,630
randomly generated lava pool and I
thought it was the lava level and that's

24
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,640
thought it was the lava level and that's
 

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,639
thought it was the lava level and that's
why I start digging up there but in fact

26
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:51,649
why I start digging up there but in fact
 

27
00:00:51,649 --> 00:01:01,569
why I start digging up there but in fact
the real lava level is quite a bit lower

28
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:01,579

 

29
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,100

yeah I've been mining Street for three

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,110
yeah I've been mining Street for three
 

31
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,820
yeah I've been mining Street for three
days

32
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
days
 

33
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,440
days
probably good six hours at least mining

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,450
probably good six hours at least mining
 

35
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,810
probably good six hours at least mining
this out and I can't take it anymore so

36
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:17,820
this out and I can't take it anymore so
 

37
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,320
this out and I can't take it anymore so
we're gonna try to hook up our trap now

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,330
we're gonna try to hook up our trap now
 

39
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,080
we're gonna try to hook up our trap now
and the lava level is do you remove one

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,090
and the lava level is do you remove one
 

41
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,440
and the lava level is do you remove one
of these blocks

42
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,450
of these blocks
 

43
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:40,069
of these blocks
that's the lava level so this is what I

44
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
that's the lava level so this is what I
 

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,740
that's the lava level so this is what I
got figured out this is where the mob

46
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:42,750
got figured out this is where the mob
 

47
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,569
got figured out this is where the mob
elevator is gonna be it's gonna be a

48
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:44,579
elevator is gonna be it's gonna be a
 

49
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,889
elevator is gonna be it's gonna be a
three by three area all these things are

50
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:48,899
three by three area all these things are
 

51
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,289
three by three area all these things are
canals that will carry the mobs to this

52
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:51,299
canals that will carry the mobs to this
 

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,469
canals that will carry the mobs to this
elevator and then it the mob elevator

54
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
elevator and then it the mob elevator
 

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,810
elevator and then it the mob elevator
will take them up to the surface and

56
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:58,820

 

57
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,280

I've been looking for guides on how to

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,290
I've been looking for guides on how to
 

59
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,080
I've been looking for guides on how to
build this and I can't really find

60
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,090
build this and I can't really find
 

61
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,540
build this and I can't really find
anything concrete since the since that

62
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:08,550
anything concrete since the since that
 

63
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,820
anything concrete since the since that
Halloween update nobody really knows

64
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,830
Halloween update nobody really knows
 

65
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,670
Halloween update nobody really knows
what to do it seems

66
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,680
what to do it seems
 

67
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,920
what to do it seems
so I decided to make them three-wide the

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:17,930
so I decided to make them three-wide the
 

69
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,229
so I decided to make them three-wide the
canals because I thought spiders might

70
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
canals because I thought spiders might
 

71
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,240
canals because I thought spiders might
not fit if it's only a two to wide canal

72
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,250
not fit if it's only a two to wide canal
 

73
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,140
not fit if it's only a two to wide canal
and so I made them three wide and I

74
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,150
and so I made them three wide and I
 

75
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,589
and so I made them three wide and I
didn't know how big to make these little

76
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
didn't know how big to make these little
 

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,080
didn't know how big to make these little
areas for them to spawn on because if

78
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,090
areas for them to spawn on because if
 

79
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,449
areas for them to spawn on because if
it's too big they're not gonna wander

80
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:37,459
it's too big they're not gonna wander
 

81
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,050
it's too big they're not gonna wander
off into the water and if it's too small

82
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,060
off into the water and if it's too small
 

83
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,630
off into the water and if it's too small
it's gonna really lower the efficiency

84
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:43,640
it's gonna really lower the efficiency
 

85
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,460
it's gonna really lower the efficiency
so I took a random guess this is a 13 by

86
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,470
so I took a random guess this is a 13 by
 

87
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,160
so I took a random guess this is a 13 by
13 with a pattern repeating every 16 by

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,170
13 with a pattern repeating every 16 by
 

89
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:06,369
13 with a pattern repeating every 16 by
16 because the waters 3 and so yeah

90
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,379
16 because the waters 3 and so yeah
 

91
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:11,170
16 because the waters 3 and so yeah
let's get started oh boy how do I get

92
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,180
let's get started oh boy how do I get
 

93
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,740
let's get started oh boy how do I get
out here

94
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:11,750
out here
 

95
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:20,530
out here
oh yeah so the first thing we're gonna

96
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:20,540
oh yeah so the first thing we're gonna
 

97
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,140
oh yeah so the first thing we're gonna
do oh yeah I want to show you all the

98
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,150
do oh yeah I want to show you all the
 

99
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:34,530
do oh yeah I want to show you all the
resources full full half polish full

100
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,540
resources full full half polish full
 

101
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,800
resources full full half polish full
more junk those are all the goodies I've

102
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:41,810
more junk those are all the goodies I've
 

103
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,069
more junk those are all the goodies I've
gone through for Diamond pickaxes and

104
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:47,079

 

105
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,210

got all this stuff so we're pretty much

106
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,220
got all this stuff so we're pretty much
 

107
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,849
got all this stuff so we're pretty much
set we can start building cool things

108
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:54,859
set we can start building cool things
 

109
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:07,599
set we can start building cool things
now so oh yeah another thing oh another

110
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:07,609
now so oh yeah another thing oh another
 

111
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,759
now so oh yeah another thing oh another
thing I wanted to mention when I was

112
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:09,769
thing I wanted to mention when I was
 

113
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,710
thing I wanted to mention when I was
digging this out I was like watching TV

114
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:11,720
digging this out I was like watching TV
 

115
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,420
digging this out I was like watching TV
on my computer and I wasn't really

116
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,430
on my computer and I wasn't really
 

117
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,599
on my computer and I wasn't really
paying attention to what I was doing and

118
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:16,609
paying attention to what I was doing and
 

119
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,420
paying attention to what I was doing and
so this ended up being a lot longer than

120
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,430
so this ended up being a lot longer than
 

121
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,399
so this ended up being a lot longer than
I wanted it to be I wanted it to be wide

122
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,409
I wanted it to be I wanted it to be wide
 

123
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,149
I wanted it to be I wanted it to be wide
and short and it ended up being long and

124
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:25,159
and short and it ended up being long and
 

125
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,330
and short and it ended up being long and
narrow

126
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,340
narrow
 

127
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,240
narrow
so it might not work perfectly but

128
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,250
so it might not work perfectly but
 

129
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,900
so it might not work perfectly but
hopefully hopefully it's still okay if

130
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:32,910
hopefully hopefully it's still okay if
 

131
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,820
hopefully hopefully it's still okay if
you're gonna if you're gonna do this you

132
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:34,830
you're gonna if you're gonna do this you
 

133
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,730
you're gonna if you're gonna do this you
should make it wider and shorter but oh

134
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:40,740
should make it wider and shorter but oh
 

135
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,300
should make it wider and shorter but oh
well I was watching the movie more than

136
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,310
well I was watching the movie more than
 

137
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,530
well I was watching the movie more than
the game because mining is very boring

138
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:51,540
the game because mining is very boring
 

139
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,400
the game because mining is very boring
if you do it for hours and hours and I

140
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,410
if you do it for hours and hours and I
 

141
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,330
if you do it for hours and hours and I
really wish I had some TNT and that's

142
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,340
really wish I had some TNT and that's
 

143
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,400
really wish I had some TNT and that's
kind of why we're building this - okay

144
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,410
kind of why we're building this - okay
 

145
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,090
kind of why we're building this - okay
so of course it's night time it's always

146
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,100
so of course it's night time it's always
 

147
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,610
so of course it's night time it's always
night time when I go outside I brought

148
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
night time when I go outside I brought
 

149
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,690
night time when I go outside I brought
lots of wood with me

150
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:14,700
lots of wood with me
 

151
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,700
lots of wood with me
and what we're gonna do we're gonna

152
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,710
and what we're gonna do we're gonna
 

153
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,400
and what we're gonna do we're gonna
start setting this elevator up and I'm

154
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,410
start setting this elevator up and I'm
 

155
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,260
start setting this elevator up and I'm
just gonna put a little fence around it

156
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
just gonna put a little fence around it
 

157
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,370
just gonna put a little fence around it
so the weight comes and falls on on me

158
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,380
so the weight comes and falls on on me
 

159
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:39,140
so the weight comes and falls on on me
while we're building this and hopefully

160
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,150
while we're building this and hopefully
 

161
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,790
while we're building this and hopefully
it's not so dark that you guys can't see

162
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
it's not so dark that you guys can't see
 

163

there's no way of getting out of here
 

171
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,140
there's no way of getting out of here
once we start we're gonna be putting

172
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,150
once we start we're gonna be putting
 

173
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:18,409
once we start we're gonna be putting
signs around here so I brought this and

174
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:18,419
signs around here so I brought this and
 

175
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,280
signs around here so I brought this and
I'm gonna put that there

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,290

 

177
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:31,200

and we're going to make a water pool and

178
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,210
and we're going to make a water pool and
 

179
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,520
and we're going to make a water pool and
craft our signs we are going to be using

180
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,530
craft our signs we are going to be using
 

181
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,690
craft our signs we are going to be using
a lot and a lot of signs and of course I

182
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:40,700
a lot and a lot of signs and of course I
 

183
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:48,760
a lot and a lot of signs and of course I
have no sticks I hate when I do that so

184
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,770
have no sticks I hate when I do that so
 

185
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,230
have no sticks I hate when I do that so
I'm probably not gonna show you all this

186
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm probably not gonna show you all this
 

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,330
I'm probably not gonna show you all this
I just want to show you how it's going

188
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:52,340
I just want to show you how it's going
 

189
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,500
I just want to show you how it's going
to be done first because this will get

190
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,510
to be done first because this will get
 

191
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,650
to be done first because this will get
boring too

192
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:58,660
boring too
 

193
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,780
boring too
and some people were wondering what I

194
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:01,790
and some people were wondering what I
 

195
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,320
and some people were wondering what I
use to record I use fraps and I edit

196
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,330
use to record I use fraps and I edit
 

197
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,220
use to record I use fraps and I edit
with virtualdub

198
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,230
with virtualdub
 

199
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:11,830
with virtualdub
I barely edit my videos I just cut out

200
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
I barely edit my videos I just cut out
 

201
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,589
I barely edit my videos I just cut out
boring stuff which is a lot usually

202
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:20,599

 

203
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,309

okay so what we're gonna do to get a 3x3

204
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
okay so what we're gonna do to get a 3x3
 

205
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,779
okay so what we're gonna do to get a 3x3
area we are going to put sign here sign

206
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:28,789
area we are going to put sign here sign
 

207
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:43,629
area we are going to put sign here sign
here sign here signs there we need to

208
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:43,639
here sign here signs there we need to
 

209
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,230
here sign here signs there we need to
make a 3x3 area of signs and on top of

210
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,240
make a 3x3 area of signs and on top of
 

211
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,409
make a 3x3 area of signs and on top of
that we're going to place water and to

212
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:50,419
that we're going to place water and to
 

213
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:57,519
that we're going to place water and to
do that yeah probably not gonna have

214
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:57,529
do that yeah probably not gonna have
 

215
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:08,950
do that yeah probably not gonna have
enough wood

216
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960

 

217
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:20,959

or signs

218
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:20,969

 

219
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,119

okay so to do that we're gonna use it

220
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:24,129
okay so to do that we're gonna use it
 

221
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,129
okay so to do that we're gonna use it
another trick here you can place a sign

222
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:26,139
another trick here you can place a sign
 

223
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,519
another trick here you can place a sign
on top of another sign to make a

224
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:29,529
on top of another sign to make a
 

225
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:38,269
on top of another sign to make a
floating sign which is very cool

226
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279

 

227
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,980

and that will allow us to place water on

228
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:40,990
and that will allow us to place water on
 

229
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:55,710
and that will allow us to place water on
top and I'm hoping no we got a place

230
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,720
top and I'm hoping no we got a place
 

231
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:05,240
top and I'm hoping no we got a place
water in all all nine blocks that sucks

232
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,250

 

233
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,600

Wow

234
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,610

 

235
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:17,189

yeah I should do it I don't want to sort

236
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:17,199
yeah I should do it I don't want to sort
 

237
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,360
yeah I should do it I don't want to sort
of place one in the middle we have to

238
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,370
of place one in the middle we have to
 

239
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:30,180
of place one in the middle we have to
place a block there do the sides oh this

240
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,190
place a block there do the sides oh this
 

241
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,630
place a block there do the sides oh this
is going to suck okay let's check it out

242
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
is going to suck okay let's check it out
 

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:50,160
is going to suck okay let's check it out
make sure it's right perfect so we're

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,170
make sure it's right perfect so we're
 

245
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,750
make sure it's right perfect so we're
gonna have to do that about thirty times

246
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
gonna have to do that about thirty times
 

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,130
gonna have to do that about thirty times
and we're gonna have to keep moving this

248
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,140
and we're gonna have to keep moving this
 

249
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,259
and we're gonna have to keep moving this
pool down lower and so the next water

250
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:01,269
pool down lower and so the next water
 

251
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,019
pool down lower and so the next water
would be here signs here water signs

252
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:04,029
would be here signs here water signs
 

253
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:11,240
would be here signs here water signs
water like 30 times to get to the bottom

254
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,250
water like 30 times to get to the bottom
 

255
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,370
water like 30 times to get to the bottom
which is a long ways down so I'm not

256
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,380
which is a long ways down so I'm not
 

257
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,720
which is a long ways down so I'm not
gonna let you guys watch that cuz that

258
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,730
gonna let you guys watch that cuz that
 

259
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,939
gonna let you guys watch that cuz that
is gonna be so boring so I'll see you in

260
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:17,949
is gonna be so boring so I'll see you in
 

261
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:24,170
is gonna be so boring so I'll see you in
a bit well it's coming along slowly but

262
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,180
a bit well it's coming along slowly but
 

263
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,220
a bit well it's coming along slowly but
it's not as bad as I thought it was

264
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,230
it's not as bad as I thought it was
 

265
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,990
it's not as bad as I thought it was
gonna be still got a ways to go and I

266
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,000
gonna be still got a ways to go and I
 

267
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,780
gonna be still got a ways to go and I
ran out of wood

268
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:32,790
ran out of wood
 

269
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,690
ran out of wood
so I'm gonna do this off-camera some

270
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:36,700
so I'm gonna do this off-camera some
 

271
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,320
so I'm gonna do this off-camera some
other time I'll show you what it looks

272
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,330
other time I'll show you what it looks
 

273
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,550
other time I'll show you what it looks
like so the reason why I don't want

274
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
like so the reason why I don't want
 

275
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,380
like so the reason why I don't want
flowing water is because I don't want

276
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,390
flowing water is because I don't want
 

277
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,110
flowing water is because I don't want
the mobs gathering in one place and

278
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
the mobs gathering in one place and
 

279
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,430
the mobs gathering in one place and
getting stuck which is also why I make

280
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
getting stuck which is also why I make
 

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,800
getting stuck which is also why I make
why I made this a three by three instead

282
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:55,810
why I made this a three by three instead
 

283
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,640
why I made this a three by three instead
of a two by two which is in normal just

284
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,650
of a two by two which is in normal just
 

285
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,200
of a two by two which is in normal just
so that they have more space to get up

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,210
so that they have more space to get up
 

287
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,750
so that they have more space to get up
here without getting in each other's way

288
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760

 

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,080

but also the water is not flowing down

290
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,090
but also the water is not flowing down
 

291
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,730
but also the water is not flowing down
so they'll be able to swim up here

292
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:11,740
so they'll be able to swim up here
 

293
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,420
so they'll be able to swim up here
faster

294
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,430
faster
 

295
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,600
faster
and these spaces in between allow them

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:15,610
and these spaces in between allow them
 

297
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,800
and these spaces in between allow them
to breathe while they're while they're

298
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:19,810
to breathe while they're while they're
 

299
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,450
to breathe while they're while they're
swimming up here so they won't drown

300
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:23,460

 

301
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,710

because we don't want them dead we want

302
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:25,720
because we don't want them dead we want
 

303
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,050
because we don't want them dead we want
them get up here and then and then we'll

304
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,060
them get up here and then and then we'll
 

305
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:37,560
them get up here and then and then we'll
deal with them so yeah taking awhile but

306
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:37,570
deal with them so yeah taking awhile but
 

307
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,020
deal with them so yeah taking awhile but
it's an important part of this so I'll

308
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,030
it's an important part of this so I'll
 

309
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:46,230
it's an important part of this so I'll
take my time on it and I did fall down

310
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
take my time on it and I did fall down
 

311
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
take my time on it and I did fall down
there by accident and discovered there's

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,490
there by accident and discovered there's
 

313
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,270
there by accident and discovered there's
the ladders so one more thing we need to

314
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,280
the ladders so one more thing we need to
 

315
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,330
the ladders so one more thing we need to
figure out is how we're gonna do the

316
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,340
figure out is how we're gonna do the
 

317
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,750
figure out is how we're gonna do the
water

318
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
water
 

319
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:08,250
water
genell's here um all the water has to

320
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:08,260
genell's here um all the water has to
 

321
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:18,720
genell's here um all the water has to
flow this way to this point the elevator

322
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:18,730
flow this way to this point the elevator
 

323
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,380
flow this way to this point the elevator
will be here actually we need we need

324
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,390
will be here actually we need we need
 

325
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:28,470

pressure plates or I'm gonna use

326
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
pressure plates or I'm gonna use
 

327
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,750
pressure plates or I'm gonna use
pressure plates just because I like

328
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:30,760
pressure plates just because I like
 

329
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,100
pressure plates just because I like
using pressure plates you can use signs

330
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,110
using pressure plates you can use signs
 

331
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,930
using pressure plates you can use signs
can't use ladders cuz ma Polly gets

332
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:36,940
can't use ladders cuz ma Polly gets
 

333
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,700
can't use ladders cuz ma Polly gets
stuck on them

334
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:43,710

 

335
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,890

and that's for the elevator don't use

336
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,900
and that's for the elevator don't use
 

337
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,450
and that's for the elevator don't use
ladders either because they'll get stuck

338
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:48,460
ladders either because they'll get stuck
 

339
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:58,350
ladders either because they'll get stuck
on them so I'm gonna put three pressure

340
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,360
on them so I'm gonna put three pressure
 

341
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,370
on them so I'm gonna put three pressure

you can grab water from the middle

352
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:24,900
you can grab water from the middle
 

353
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:35,100
you can grab water from the middle
without making it disappear one two

354

367
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,900

want to use the same pattern for every

one one two three four five six seven so
 

371
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,100
one one two three four five six seven so
that's good we that are repeating

the tree farm is now bigger it's a four

418
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,150
the tree farm is now bigger it's a four
 

419
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:54,860
the tree farm is now bigger it's a four
by four step a three by three so that's

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:54,870
by four step a three by three so that's
 

421
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,430
by four step a three by three so that's
good

426
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:01,860
signs and at some point we're going to
 

427
