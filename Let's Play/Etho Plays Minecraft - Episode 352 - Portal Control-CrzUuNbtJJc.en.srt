as gold farm as cool right but what

104
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
as gold farm as cool right but what
 

105
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,250
as gold farm as cool right but what
would make it cooler is if we could turn

106
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,260
would make it cooler is if we could turn
 

107
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,650
would make it cooler is if we could turn
it on and off easily right so that's

108
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,660
it on and off easily right so that's
 

109
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,339
it on and off easily right so that's
that's sort of the point to this just to

110
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:55,349
that's sort of the point to this just to
 

111
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,830
that's sort of the point to this just to
try to make something better basically

112
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
try to make something better basically
 

113
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,399
try to make something better basically
and if it saves time all the better but

114
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:01,409
and if it saves time all the better but
 

115
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,729
and if it saves time all the better but
what what it should do one of them is

116
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:04,739
what what it should do one of them is
 

117
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,140
what what it should do one of them is
out right now this is the light them and

118
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,150
out right now this is the light them and
 

119
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,580
out right now this is the light them and
the wire is running down the middle here

120
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:10,590
the wire is running down the middle here
 

121
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,050
the wire is running down the middle here
to do that and then the one to

122
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,060
to do that and then the one to
 

123
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,149
to do that and then the one to
extinguish it it's all being controlled

124
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
extinguish it it's all being controlled
 

125

I have to get out well let's just say

174
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
I have to get out well let's just say
 

175
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,760
I have to get out well let's just say
I've died many times because I either

176
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:32,770
I've died many times because I either
 

177
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,170
I've died many times because I either
like try to break my way out and then

178
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,180
like try to break my way out and then
 

179
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,790
like try to break my way out and then
I'll hit one of them and then I'm dead

180
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
I'll hit one of them and then I'm dead
 

181
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,210
I'll hit one of them and then I'm dead
instantly pretty much so we need a way

182
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,220
instantly pretty much so we need a way
 

183
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,240
instantly pretty much so we need a way
of turning this one on and off too and

184
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,250
of turning this one on and off too and
 

185
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:50,290
of turning this one on and off too and
maybe the one above yeah there might

186
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:50,300
maybe the one above yeah there might
 

187
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,940
maybe the one above yeah there might
have been a reason I never automated

188
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:51,950
have been a reason I never automated
 

189
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,480
have been a reason I never automated
this now that I that I've tried I had it

190
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,490
this now that I that I've tried I had it
 

191
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,630
this now that I that I've tried I had it
all set up here put the laven and the

192
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:58,640
all set up here put the laven and the
 

193
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,100
all set up here put the laven and the
the flint and steel and all that it was

194
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,110
the flint and steel and all that it was
 

195
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,820
the flint and steel and all that it was
ready to go and then I found out that it

196
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,830
ready to go and then I found out that it
 

197
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,830
ready to go and then I found out that it
it was stealing it because below the

198
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
it was stealing it because below the
 

199
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,800
it was stealing it because below the
dispensers where I need to put them is

200
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:10,810
dispensers where I need to put them is
 

201
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,370
dispensers where I need to put them is
the hopper timer and when it runs it it

202
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,380
the hopper timer and when it runs it it
 

203
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,980
the hopper timer and when it runs it it
steals anything we put in the dispensers

204
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:17,990
steals anything we put in the dispensers
 

205
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,440
steals anything we put in the dispensers
and I am NOT moving this thing because I

206
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,450
and I am NOT moving this thing because I
 

207
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,900
and I am NOT moving this thing because I
had such a hard time getting this all to

208
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:25,910
had such a hard time getting this all to
 

209
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,230
had such a hard time getting this all to
fit before so we'll just pass on this

210
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,240
fit before so we'll just pass on this
 

211
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,470
fit before so we'll just pass on this
one I think although I just had an idea

212
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,480
one I think although I just had an idea
 

213
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,730
one I think although I just had an idea
let's try this out

214
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:33,740
let's try this out
 

215
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,980
let's try this out
there was a portal I used to use fire

216
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:35,990
there was a portal I used to use fire
 

217
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,660
there was a portal I used to use fire
churches on and I would like shoot them

218
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:37,670
churches on and I would like shoot them
 

219
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,420
churches on and I would like shoot them
from the corner here I'm wondering if

220
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,430
from the corner here I'm wondering if
 

221
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,180
from the corner here I'm wondering if
this trick still works or not

222
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,190

 

223
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,370

nope nope I think it was in the corner

224
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,380
nope nope I think it was in the corner
 

225
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,340
nope nope I think it was in the corner
maybe it wasn't

226
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,350
maybe it wasn't
 

227
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,380
maybe it wasn't
let's try one block up maybe it was a

228
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,390
let's try one block up maybe it was a
 

229
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,470
let's try one block up maybe it was a
little higher because that would be

230
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,480
little higher because that would be
 

231
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,740
little higher because that would be
really cool I basically just can't put

232
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:00,750
really cool I basically just can't put
 

233
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,480
really cool I basically just can't put
the dispensers where they were there

234
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,490
the dispensers where they were there
 

235
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,680
the dispensers where they were there
they can be anywhere else probably you

236
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:06,690
they can be anywhere else probably you
 

237
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,690
they can be anywhere else probably you
see the squid there I'm so tempted to

238
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:08,700
see the squid there I'm so tempted to
 

239
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,610

name this guy I'm not sure if you would

240
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,620

242
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,030
live though or not if you would
 

243
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,310
live though or not if you would
suffocate eventually oh it does work

these ones this middle portal wasn't
 

279
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,440
these ones this middle portal wasn't
hooked up before it is now we got the

280
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,450
hooked up before it is now we got the
 

281
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,320
hooked up before it is now we got the
lava one there and the flint and steel

282
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,330
lava one there and the flint and steel
 

283
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,530
lava one there and the flint and steel
so I hooked that up to these buttons as

284
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:18,540
so I hooked that up to these buttons as
 

285
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,990
so I hooked that up to these buttons as
well if we want to light it we hit this

286
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
well if we want to light it we hit this
 

287
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,560

one goes down the chain here you saw

288
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,570
one goes down the chain here you saw
 

289
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,330
one goes down the chain here you saw
this one just got lit or you saw the

290
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,340
this one just got lit or you saw the
 

291
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,210
this one just got lit or you saw the
particles hopefully and those all get

292
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,220
particles hopefully and those all get
 

293
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,950
particles hopefully and those all get
lit sand then we'll do the the lava and

294
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:33,960
lit sand then we'll do the the lava and
 

295
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,990
lit sand then we'll do the the lava and
if we're quick they'd actually see it

296
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
if we're quick they'd actually see it
 

297
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,060
if we're quick they'd actually see it
happen here I hit the wrong button

298
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,070
happen here I hit the wrong button
 

299
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,700
happen here I hit the wrong button
I gotta get some signs on these or or

300
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:42,710
I gotta get some signs on these or or
 

301
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,590
I gotta get some signs on these or or
maybe I'll make one wood and one one

302
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:44,600
maybe I'll make one wood and one one
 

303
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,160
maybe I'll make one wood and one one
stone

304
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,170
stone
 

305
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,020
stone
but yeah you see how the lava it got

306
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,030
but yeah you see how the lava it got
 

307
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,370
but yeah you see how the lava it got
shot out and then picked up pretty

308
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:48,380
shot out and then picked up pretty
 

309
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,400
shot out and then picked up pretty
quickly there so that's good if what do

310
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,410
quickly there so that's good if what do
 

311
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,960
quickly there so that's good if what do
you want to do how we can leave these

312
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:55,970
you want to do how we can leave these
 

313
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,320
you want to do how we can leave these
off actually let's go up here now

314
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,330
off actually let's go up here now
 

315
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,380
off actually let's go up here now
there's another portal up on the roof

316
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,390
there's another portal up on the roof
 

317
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,300
there's another portal up on the roof
it's all really really complicated

318
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,310
it's all really really complicated
 

319
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,090
it's all really really complicated
there's so many portals and they all

320
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,100
there's so many portals and they all
 

321
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,480
there's so many portals and they all
work differently with each other since

322
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,490
work differently with each other since
 

323
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,100
work differently with each other since
this one's above the nether ceiling you

324
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,110
this one's above the nether ceiling you
 

325
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,220
this one's above the nether ceiling you
can never actually go from from here to

326
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,230
can never actually go from from here to
 

327
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,630
can never actually go from from here to
to its but yeah that that one takes you

328
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,640
to its but yeah that that one takes you
 

329
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,490
to its but yeah that that one takes you
to here this is up at the top of the

330
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:21,500
to here this is up at the top of the
 

331
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,140
to here this is up at the top of the
gold farm we hopped down that's what I

332
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,150
gold farm we hopped down that's what I
 

333
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,200
gold farm we hopped down that's what I
use when I want to harvest this you see

334
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,210
use when I want to harvest this you see
 

335
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,820
use when I want to harvest this you see
I got all these slime blocks right in

336
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:30,830
I got all these slime blocks right in
 

337
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,300
I got all these slime blocks right in
here

338
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,310
here
 

339
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,010
here
the fireball trick did work so I added

340
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,020
the fireball trick did work so I added
 

341
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,969
the fireball trick did work so I added
in two more buttons and basically if I

342
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979
in two more buttons and basically if I
 

343
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,540
in two more buttons and basically if I
hit the left one portal goes out hit the

344
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,550
hit the left one portal goes out hit the
 

345
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,570
hit the left one portal goes out hit the
right one and it lights it and you can

346
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:46,580
right one and it lights it and you can
 

347
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,240
right one and it lights it and you can
see the this is like just vertical

348
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,250
see the this is like just vertical
 

349
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,910
see the this is like just vertical
redstone basically I cheated there's a

350
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
redstone basically I cheated there's a
 

351
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,130
redstone basically I cheated there's a
sticky piston pushes the slime blocks up

352
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,140
sticky piston pushes the slime blocks up
 

353
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,630
sticky piston pushes the slime blocks up
and then there's a redstone block at the

354
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:55,640
and then there's a redstone block at the
 

355
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,460
and then there's a redstone block at the
top which goes to another sticky piston

356
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,470
top which goes to another sticky piston
 

357
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,260
top which goes to another sticky piston
and you can do a chain as high as you

358
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,270
and you can do a chain as high as you
 

359
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,410
and you can do a chain as high as you
want doing that you only have 12 blocks

360
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,420
want doing that you only have 12 blocks
 

361
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,830
want doing that you only have 12 blocks
so per section but yeah if you hit these

362
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:07,840
so per section but yeah if you hit these
 

363
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,910
so per section but yeah if you hit these

364
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
activates support up there because I
 

365
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,660

want the two in sync with each other and

366
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:12,670
want the two in sync with each other and

it's fine now but if Mike I'm doing
 

373
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,990
it's fine now but if Mike I'm doing
other things on my computer like if I

other things on my computer like if I
 

375
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,310
other things on my computer like if I
have it's fine it's good it seems to

376
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,320
have it's fine it's good it seems to
 

377
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,050
have it's fine it's good it seems to
take longer to shut down now - I think

378
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,060
take longer to shut down now - I think
 

379
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,450
take longer to shut down now - I think
some of the redstone wires have crossed

yeah let's turn it on now if we go up it

386
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:43,840
yeah let's turn it on now if we go up it
 

387
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,270
yeah let's turn it on now if we go up it
should be on up there - right again the

take us now to the main entrance in the
 

409
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,880
take us now to the main entrance in the
nether hub because we shut the portals

410
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:14,890
nether hub because we shut the portals
 

411
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,200
nether hub because we shut the portals
off - up at the top there and and they

off - up at the top there and and they
 

413
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,060
off - up at the top there and and they
won't interfere with our portal Network

414
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,070
won't interfere with our portal Network
 

415
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,660
won't interfere with our portal Network
anymore which is great if we want to go

416
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:24,670
anymore which is great if we want to go
 

417
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,820
anymore which is great if we want to go
to the stronghold base we got to set

418
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:26,830
to the stronghold base we got to set
 

419
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,320
to the stronghold base we got to set
this to 10 which it's at

420
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,330

 

421
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,340

behind us you hear the piston go oh we
 

425
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,160
behind us you hear the piston go oh we
left this one on oops

426
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,170
left this one on oops
 

427
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,639

hey just for demonstration great kids

428
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:49,649
hey just for demonstration great kids
 

429
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,500

this should take us to the stronghold

430
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,510
this should take us to the stronghold
 

431
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,160

portal hopefully oh this stupid ones

432
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,170
portal hopefully oh this stupid ones
 

433
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,410
portal hopefully oh this stupid ones
still here - ah it would have if we

434
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,420
still here - ah it would have if we
 

435
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,240
still here - ah it would have if we
didn't have more portals interfering

436
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,250
didn't have more portals interfering
 

437
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,430
didn't have more portals interfering
this one's gonna take us to I think the

438
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
this one's gonna take us to I think the
 

439
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,490
this one's gonna take us to I think the
city and farm area yeah I should just

440
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:07,500
city and farm area yeah I should just
 

441
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,680
city and farm area yeah I should just
break this one honestly alright

442
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,690

 

443
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,810

you die now okay okay everyone we are

444
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:20,820
you die now okay okay everyone we are
 

445
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,730
you die now okay okay everyone we are
going to run through a little test now a

446
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:22,740
going to run through a little test now a
 

447
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,819
going to run through a little test now a
little scenario and try out the portal

448
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:25,829
little scenario and try out the portal
 

449
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,180
little scenario and try out the portal
network for real now because we did that

450
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,190
network for real now because we did that
 

451
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,100
network for real now because we did that
stuff at the gold farm we only want

452
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,110
stuff at the gold farm we only want
 

453
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,720
stuff at the gold farm we only want
those portals on when we're actually

454
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:32,730
those portals on when we're actually
 

455
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,420
those portals on when we're actually
using it so right now they're off I turn

456
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:35,430
using it so right now they're off I turn
 

457
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,970
using it so right now they're off I turn
them off it's really easy to turn them

458
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:37,980
them off it's really easy to turn them
 

459
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,829
them off it's really easy to turn them
on though because we we set up all that

460
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
on though because we we set up all that
 

461
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,500
on though because we we set up all that
stuff today just press two buttons and

462
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,510
stuff today just press two buttons and
 

463
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,930
stuff today just press two buttons and
you're good but now that we have those

464
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:44,940
you're good but now that we have those
 

465
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,699
you're good but now that we have those
working we can actually use the portal

466
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:46,709
working we can actually use the portal
 

467
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,490
working we can actually use the portal
network as well the way I intended to

468
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:49,500
network as well the way I intended to
 

469
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,210
network as well the way I intended to
but they were interfering with it for so

470
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,220
but they were interfering with it for so
 

471
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,780
but they were interfering with it for so
long I haven't used it really so we're

472
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:56,790
long I haven't used it really so we're
 

473
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,010
long I haven't used it really so we're
going to run through the test here a

474
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,020
going to run through the test here a
 

475
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,269
going to run through the test here a
little scenario to make sure it works

476
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279

with that but did a full full round-trip
 

613
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,170
with that but did a full full round-trip
this time which is good go through it is

614

this time which is good go through it is
 

615
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,300
this time which is good go through it is
the man cave and we are home so that's

616
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,310
the man cave and we are home so that's
 

617
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,460
the man cave and we are home so that's
kind of the way it'll work it seems like

618
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,470
kind of the way it'll work it seems like
 

619
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,310
kind of the way it'll work it seems like
a lot of like rigger rig Amaro to it but

620

a lot of like rigger rig Amaro to it but
 

621
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,860
a lot of like rigger rig Amaro to it but
I think once I get used to it it'll be

794
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,040
rid of it
 

795
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,030
rid of it
it's just a thought though I'm gonna

796
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,040
it's just a thought though I'm gonna
 

797
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,460
it's just a thought though I'm gonna
save this area for as some sort of

798
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,470
save this area for as some sort of
 

799
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,580
save this area for as some sort of
tunnel after all but maybe we can put

800
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,590
tunnel after all but maybe we can put
 

801
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,490
tunnel after all but maybe we can put
some farmland like going down this hill

802
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:42,500
some farmland like going down this hill
 

803
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,170
some farmland like going down this hill
that might look a little better than the

804
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,180
that might look a little better than the
 

805
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,390
that might look a little better than the
stone we have currently let's try it out

806
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
stone we have currently let's try it out
 

807
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,130
stone we have currently let's try it out
switch it out and we will see what it

808
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,140
switch it out and we will see what it
 

809
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,570
switch it out and we will see what it
ends up looking like Oh

810
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:55,580

 

811
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,610

I haven't decided yet if I liked it or

812
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:57,620
I haven't decided yet if I liked it or
 

813
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,680
I haven't decided yet if I liked it or
not I'll have to look at it for a while

814
00:21:59,680 --> 00:21:59,690
not I'll have to look at it for a while
 

815
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,040
not I'll have to look at it for a while
I think our farmer villager seems to

816
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,050
I think our farmer villager seems to
 

817
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,720
I think our farmer villager seems to
have died though I was hoping he would

818
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:04,730
have died though I was hoping he would
 

819
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,520
have died though I was hoping he would
come by and we would see if he would

820
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,530
come by and we would see if he would
 

821
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,210
come by and we would see if he would
harvest this or not but yeah he's dead

822
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,220
harvest this or not but yeah he's dead
 

823
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,500
harvest this or not but yeah he's dead
he's gone so I I fed the villager some

824
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,510
he's gone so I I fed the villager some
 

825
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,770
he's gone so I I fed the villager some
bread and hopefully they give us a

826
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:17,780
bread and hopefully they give us a
 

827
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,160
bread and hopefully they give us a
little baby farmer that will tend to the

828
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,170
little baby farmer that will tend to the
 

829
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,100
little baby farmer that will tend to the
crops never tried carrots instead the

830
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,110
crops never tried carrots instead the
 

831
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,890
crops never tried carrots instead the
thing about wheat it's got that yellow

832
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:26,900
thing about wheat it's got that yellow
 

833
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,720
thing about wheat it's got that yellow
color to it and I don't think it's very

834
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:28,730
color to it and I don't think it's very
 

835
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,020
color to it and I don't think it's very
good here while carrots and potatoes

836
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,030
good here while carrots and potatoes
 

837
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,810
good here while carrots and potatoes

get so good at redstone works so a long

848
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:56,780
get so good at redstone works so a long
 

849
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,180
get so good at redstone works so a long
time ago maybe too well I get sprouted

850
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,190
time ago maybe too well I get sprouted
 

851
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,570
time ago maybe too well I get sprouted
in three years now I did attempt briefly

852
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:04,580
in three years now I did attempt briefly
 

853
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,880
in three years now I did attempt briefly
to make a minecraft mod I didn't get

854
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:06,890
to make a minecraft mod I didn't get
 

855
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,010
to make a minecraft mod I didn't get
very far with it though I was attempting

856
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,020
very far with it though I was attempting
 

857
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,270
very far with it though I was attempting
to make a terrain generator that

858
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
to make a terrain generator that
 

859
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,940
to make a terrain generator that
replaced the one built into Minecraft

860
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:15,950
replaced the one built into Minecraft
 

861
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,520
replaced the one built into Minecraft
and I was trying to do it in such a way

862
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,530
and I was trying to do it in such a way
 

863
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,810
and I was trying to do it in such a way
that you could create your own biomes

864
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:21,820
that you could create your own biomes
 

865
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,100
that you could create your own biomes
this was like right after biomes

866
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,110
this was like right after biomes
 

867
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,860
this was like right after biomes
originally came out wanted to be able to

868
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:26,870
originally came out wanted to be able to
 

869
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,810
originally came out wanted to be able to
create your own biomes and specify what

870
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:28,820
create your own biomes and specify what
 

871
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,370
create your own biomes and specify what
types of blocks were in it where they

872
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:30,380
types of blocks were in it where they
 

873
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,610
types of blocks were in it where they
were replaced and what rules guided how

874
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:33,620
were replaced and what rules guided how
 

875
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,500
were replaced and what rules guided how
they would get placed like maybe dirt

876
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,510
they would get placed like maybe dirt
 

877
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,530
they would get placed like maybe dirt
would be placed on stone like it usually

878
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:38,540
would be placed on stone like it usually
 

879
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,890
would be placed on stone like it usually
is or maybe mycelium or whatever other

880
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:41,900
is or maybe mycelium or whatever other
 

881
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,320
is or maybe mycelium or whatever other
blocks and then I wanted to make it so

882
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,330
blocks and then I wanted to make it so
 

883
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:50,380
blocks and then I wanted to make it so
that you could imports mcedit schematics

884
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,390
that you could imports mcedit schematics
 

885
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,530
that you could imports mcedit schematics
as structures and then dictate what

886
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:53,540
as structures and then dictate what
 

887
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,190
as structures and then dictate what
rules guide where those structures spawn

888
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
rules guide where those structures spawn
 

889
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,660
rules guide where those structures spawn
like maybe there's different height

890
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:58,670
like maybe there's different height
 

891
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,940
like maybe there's different height
levels and they have to spawn on certain

892
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:00,950
levels and they have to spawn on certain
 

893
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,720
levels and they have to spawn on certain
types of blocks and yeah I want a lot of

894
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:04,730
types of blocks and yeah I want a lot of
 

895
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,280
types of blocks and yeah I want a lot of
variety to it and then I was going to

896
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,290
variety to it and then I was going to
 

897
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,960
variety to it and then I was going to
try to to

898
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:07,970
try to to
 

899
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:16,480
try to to
- what was I going to say and have like

900
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:16,490
- what was I going to say and have like
 

901
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,340
- what was I going to say and have like
settings that would control how big the

902
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,350
settings that would control how big the
 

903
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,850
settings that would control how big the
biomes were and like what biomes could

904
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:21,860
biomes were and like what biomes could
 

905
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,730
biomes were and like what biomes could
spawn by other biomes and and you know a

906
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:24,740
spawn by other biomes and and you know a
 

907
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,470
spawn by other biomes and and you know a
lot of that stuff is in the game already

908
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
lot of that stuff is in the game already
 

909
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,159
lot of that stuff is in the game already
now but yeah I never got very far I

910
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:30,169
now but yeah I never got very far I
 

911
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:35,169
now but yeah I never got very far I
didn't like NBT file formats and I was

912
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:35,179
didn't like NBT file formats and I was
 

913
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,950
didn't like NBT file formats and I was
trying to make an editor for it and it

914
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
trying to make an editor for it and it
 

915
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,289
trying to make an editor for it and it
didn't turn out too well had trouble

916
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:41,299
didn't turn out too well had trouble
 

917
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:48,310
didn't turn out too well had trouble
with it um anyway redstone redstone like

918
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
with it um anyway redstone redstone like
 

919
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,889
with it um anyway redstone redstone like
a lot of things like some people say

920
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:50,899
a lot of things like some people say
 

921
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:52,539
a lot of things like some people say
they're not builders in this game

922
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:52,549
they're not builders in this game
 

923
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,419
they're not builders in this game
well that's because you have to learn it

924
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:55,429
well that's because you have to learn it
 

925
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,100
well that's because you have to learn it
and same with redstone you got to learn

926
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,110
and same with redstone you got to learn
 

927
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,789
and same with redstone you got to learn
redstone um it takes time the more you

928
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
redstone um it takes time the more you
 

929
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,730
redstone um it takes time the more you
do it the easier it kind of becomes and

930
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:03,740
do it the easier it kind of becomes and
 

931
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,919
do it the easier it kind of becomes and
you pick up tricks along the way and

932
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:05,929
you pick up tricks along the way and
 

933
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:07,810
you pick up tricks along the way and
sometimes you have creative thoughts and

934
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:07,820
sometimes you have creative thoughts and
 

935
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,629
sometimes you have creative thoughts and
you come up with new tricks and and

936
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:09,639
you come up with new tricks and and
 

937
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,580
you come up with new tricks and and
that's pretty much how a redstone works

938
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,590
that's pretty much how a redstone works
 

939
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,710
that's pretty much how a redstone works
it's not that complicated once you once

940
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
it's not that complicated once you once
 

941
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,499
it's not that complicated once you once
you get into it and you just pretty much

942
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:17,509
you get into it and you just pretty much
 

943
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,269
you get into it and you just pretty much
copy-paste different designs that you've

944
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
copy-paste different designs that you've
 

945
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,590
copy-paste different designs that you've
used before over and over and as you get

946
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
used before over and over and as you get
 

947
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,869
used before over and over and as you get
experience with it you don't have to

948
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:24,879
experience with it you don't have to
 

949
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:28,419
experience with it you don't have to
reference how to build certain redstone

950
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:28,429
reference how to build certain redstone
 

951
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,060
reference how to build certain redstone
devices you just kind of know it off the
