right turn something really good so I

66
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,810
right turn something really good so I
 

67
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,319
right turn something really good so I
want to try that out to start off with

68
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:03,329
want to try that out to start off with
 

69
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,459
want to try that out to start off with
here I'm gonna bring some blocks and

70
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:06,469
here I'm gonna bring some blocks and
 

71
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,669
here I'm gonna bring some blocks and
yeah so go over to the corner here

72
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:10,679
yeah so go over to the corner here
 

73
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,280
yeah so go over to the corner here
see if we can pull it off see if it

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,290
see if we can pull it off see if it
 

75
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,960
see if we can pull it off see if it
works as

76
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:13,970
works as
 

77
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,500
works as
so maybe we'll do the outside part first

78
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,510
so maybe we'll do the outside part first
 

79
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,180
so maybe we'll do the outside part first
I'm getting stuck on stuff all right so

80
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,190
I'm getting stuck on stuff all right so
 

81
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,220
I'm getting stuck on stuff all right so
just looking at the notes again I think

82
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,230
just looking at the notes again I think
 

83
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,820
just looking at the notes again I think
that what we got to do water source in

84
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:31,830
that what we got to do water source in
 

85
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,680
that what we got to do water source in
the very corner here go like that let's

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,690
the very corner here go like that let's
 

87
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,680
the very corner here go like that let's
see then we want water okay this is

88
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:42,690
see then we want water okay this is
 

89
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,949
see then we want water okay this is
important here we got to have water

90
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
important here we got to have water
 

91
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,130
important here we got to have water
going opposite direction so it'll slow

92
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,140
going opposite direction so it'll slow
 

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,199
going opposite direction so it'll slow
the boat down so we'll have another

94
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,209
the boat down so we'll have another
 

95
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,990
the boat down so we'll have another
stream going this way so when the the

96
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
stream going this way so when the the
 

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,030
stream going this way so when the the
boat goes this way this will slow it

98
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,040
boat goes this way this will slow it
 

99
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,340
boat goes this way this will slow it
down and that way it doesn't crash into

100
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,350
down and that way it doesn't crash into
 

101
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,880
down and that way it doesn't crash into
the wall and break and then I think it's

102
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:01,890
the wall and break and then I think it's
 

103
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,340
the wall and break and then I think it's
just normal I should be using my silk

104
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,350
just normal I should be using my silk
 

105
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,009
just normal I should be using my silk
touch here this stuff is not is not free

106
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:09,019
touch here this stuff is not is not free
 

107
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,930
touch here this stuff is not is not free
all right water there and I think that

108
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
all right water there and I think that
 

109
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,370
all right water there and I think that
will do the turn pretty good oh I can't

110
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,380
will do the turn pretty good oh I can't
 

111
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,300
will do the turn pretty good oh I can't
put that there

112
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,310

 

113
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,680

okay I just double checked how to do it

114
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,690
okay I just double checked how to do it
 

115
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,840
okay I just double checked how to do it
make sure I got it right so it looks

116
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:26,850
make sure I got it right so it looks
 

117
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,099
make sure I got it right so it looks
like for the outside turn what we got to

118
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:31,109
like for the outside turn what we got to
 

119
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,780
like for the outside turn what we got to
do is get water flowing this way three

120
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,790
do is get water flowing this way three
 

121
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,960
do is get water flowing this way three
blocks long and before the boat

122
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:38,970
blocks long and before the boat
 

123
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,880
blocks long and before the boat
approaches this like the boats going to

124
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:40,890
approaches this like the boats going to
 

125
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,560
approaches this like the boats going to
be going this direction right we got to

126
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:42,570
be going this direction right we got to
 

127
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,030
be going this direction right we got to
slow it down otherwise it's going to

128
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
slow it down otherwise it's going to
 

129
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,220
slow it down otherwise it's going to
crash into the wall so then we do this

130
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,230
crash into the wall so then we do this
 

131
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,900
crash into the wall so then we do this
just a short little stream like that and

132
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:52,910
just a short little stream like that and
 

133
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,150
just a short little stream like that and
check in my notes all right so then we

134
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,160
check in my notes all right so then we
 

135
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,509
check in my notes all right so then we
have another stream going here and this

136
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519
have another stream going here and this
 

137
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,550
have another stream going here and this
basically just becomes like the normal

138
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
basically just becomes like the normal
 

139
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,860
basically just becomes like the normal
road so it'll go over here slow down

140
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:06,870
road so it'll go over here slow down
 

141
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,920
road so it'll go over here slow down
take the turn and then we got to keep it

142
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:09,930
take the turn and then we got to keep it
 

143
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,800
take the turn and then we got to keep it
going this way so that's how you do that

144
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
going this way so that's how you do that
 

145
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,680
going this way so that's how you do that
corner now let's try the inside one this

146
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:15,690
corner now let's try the inside one this
 

147
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,710
corner now let's try the inside one this
looks a little more complicated okay

148
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
looks a little more complicated okay
 

149
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,509
looks a little more complicated okay
this is the inside corner I just went

150
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519
this is the inside corner I just went
 

151
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,120
this is the inside corner I just went
ahead and did it it is very very finicky

152
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,130
ahead and did it it is very very finicky
 

153
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,520
ahead and did it it is very very finicky
I don't know if it's going to work 100%

154
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,530
I don't know if it's going to work 100%
 

155
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,590
I don't know if it's going to work 100%
either but

156
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
either but
 

157
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,620
either but
basically its water source block here

158
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,630
basically its water source block here
 

159
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,090
basically its water source block here
here and here

160
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,100
here and here
 

161
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,130
here and here
it's flowing this way to slow down the

162
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:34,140
it's flowing this way to slow down the
 

163
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,580
it's flowing this way to slow down the
boat so normal Road goes to the slow

164
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:37,590
boat so normal Road goes to the slow
 

165
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,480
boat so normal Road goes to the slow
down then there's a water source here

166
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,490
down then there's a water source here
 

167
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,400
down then there's a water source here
and here right so it makes the diagonal

168
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,410
and here right so it makes the diagonal
 

169
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,070
and here right so it makes the diagonal
that helps it to get snug against this

170
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
that helps it to get snug against this
 

171
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,880
that helps it to get snug against this
wall then this seems to have to go five

172
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:49,890
wall then this seems to have to go five
 

173
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,370
wall then this seems to have to go five
blocks this way otherwise I don't know

174
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,380
blocks this way otherwise I don't know
 

175
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,260
blocks this way otherwise I don't know
if it's because of inconsistency or what

176
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,270
if it's because of inconsistency or what
 

177
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,540
if it's because of inconsistency or what
but I was having it crashing on me with

178
00:04:59,540 --> 00:04:59,550
but I was having it crashing on me with
 

179
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,450
but I was having it crashing on me with
it only four blocks long but we'll try

180
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,460
it only four blocks long but we'll try
 

181
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,770
it only four blocks long but we'll try
it out here we'll see if it works

182
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:03,780
it out here we'll see if it works
 

183
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,770
it out here we'll see if it works
last time I tested it it did work it

184
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,780
last time I tested it it did work it
 

185
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,410
last time I tested it it did work it
seems to matter what time I hop in the

186
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,420
seems to matter what time I hop in the
 

187
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,020
seems to matter what time I hop in the
boat though so here we go

188
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,030
boat though so here we go
 

189
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,360
boat though so here we go
due to a little bit of lag that's fine

190
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,370
due to a little bit of lag that's fine
 

191
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,590
due to a little bit of lag that's fine
alright alright uh-oh it did make it ok

192
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
alright alright uh-oh it did make it ok
 

193
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,010
alright alright uh-oh it did make it ok
cool it looks like it failed there but

194
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
cool it looks like it failed there but
 

195
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,400
cool it looks like it failed there but
yeah that is not too bad I'm going to

196
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,410
yeah that is not too bad I'm going to
 

197
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,020
yeah that is not too bad I'm going to
hold the right key just to see how far

198
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,030
hold the right key just to see how far
 

199
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,710
hold the right key just to see how far
away from the wall it is it looks like

200
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,720
away from the wall it is it looks like
 

201
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,770
away from the wall it is it looks like
it's right against it that's perfect oh

202
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:35,780
it's right against it that's perfect oh
 

203
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,540
it's right against it that's perfect oh
wait no I tent oh I can't move the boat

204
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,550
wait no I tent oh I can't move the boat
 

205
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,840
wait no I tent oh I can't move the boat
when I do that I gotta hold forward and

206
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:41,850
when I do that I gotta hold forward and
 

207
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,360
when I do that I gotta hold forward and
right I see so it's just a little bit of

208
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,370
right I see so it's just a little bit of
 

209
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,910
right I see so it's just a little bit of
ways away but overall pretty good tell

210
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:49,920
ways away but overall pretty good tell
 

211
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,770
ways away but overall pretty good tell
you what I'm going to go get some some

212
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:51,780
you what I'm going to go get some some
 

213
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,110
you what I'm going to go get some some
more ice and we'll finish up at least

214
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,120
more ice and we'll finish up at least
 

215
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:05,760
more ice and we'll finish up at least
one side of the road here

216
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:05,770

 

217
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,379

cool so let's try this out I got one

218
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:08,389
cool so let's try this out I got one
 

219
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,019
cool so let's try this out I got one
side of the road done here it's so

220
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:11,029
side of the road done here it's so
 

221
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,730
side of the road done here it's so
inconsistent though I don't know if it's

222
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:12,740
inconsistent though I don't know if it's
 

223
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,019
inconsistent though I don't know if it's
actually gonna be feasible um it's gonna

224
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:17,029
actually gonna be feasible um it's gonna
 

225
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,010
actually gonna be feasible um it's gonna
make it it's gonna make it no it's like

226
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,020
make it it's gonna make it no it's like
 

227
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,010
make it it's gonna make it no it's like
a death trap traps me underneath the

228
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,020
a death trap traps me underneath the
 

229
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,760
a death trap traps me underneath the
glass block and everything so here's the

230
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:27,770
glass block and everything so here's the
 

231
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,279
glass block and everything so here's the
very strange things about boats you'll

232
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,289
very strange things about boats you'll
 

233
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,079
very strange things about boats you'll
notice I didn't pick up any sticks or

234
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,089
notice I didn't pick up any sticks or
 

235
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,959
notice I didn't pick up any sticks or
planks right that's because the boat

236
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:34,969
planks right that's because the boat
 

237
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:39,839
planks right that's because the boat
actually broke over here for some reason

238
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:39,849

 

239
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:45,879

um it's so weird so very weird it's

240
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:45,889
um it's so weird so very weird it's
 

241
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,360
um it's so weird so very weird it's
almost like boats calculate their

242
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,370
almost like boats calculate their
 

243
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,269
almost like boats calculate their
position twice or something like where

244
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:51,279
position twice or something like where
 

245
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,999
position twice or something like where
where the server thinks it is and where

246
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:55,009
where the server thinks it is and where
 

247
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,670
where the server thinks it is and where
my client thinks it is or something it's

248
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
my client thinks it is or something it's
 

249
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,679
my client thinks it is or something it's
so messed up really needs to be fixed um

250
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:01,689
so messed up really needs to be fixed um
 

251
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,730
so messed up really needs to be fixed um
try one more time

252
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:03,740
try one more time
 

253
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,929
try one more time
oh it's out wait a second do I have any

254
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:07,939
oh it's out wait a second do I have any
 

255
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,689
oh it's out wait a second do I have any
on me no I'm going to make a couple more

256
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:10,699
on me no I'm going to make a couple more
 

257
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,760
on me no I'm going to make a couple more
here we'll try it one more time today

258
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:12,770
here we'll try it one more time today
 

259
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,679
here we'll try it one more time today
we're going to head out to the amplified

260
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:14,689
we're going to head out to the amplified
 

261
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,809
we're going to head out to the amplified
terrain area we haven't been there in so

262
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:16,819
terrain area we haven't been there in so
 

263
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,049
terrain area we haven't been there in so
long I keep meaning to go there and some

264
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:20,059
long I keep meaning to go there and some
 

265
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,899
long I keep meaning to go there and some
of you're like what what on earth etho

266
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:22,909
of you're like what what on earth etho
 

267
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,179
of you're like what what on earth etho
what why haven't you gone there what's

268
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:25,189
what why haven't you gone there what's
 

269
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:29,170
what why haven't you gone there what's
going on uh have you abandoned its in in

270
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,180
going on uh have you abandoned its in in
 

271
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,549
going on uh have you abandoned its in in
a way I have because I haven't been

272
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:30,559
a way I have because I haven't been
 

273
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,259
a way I have because I haven't been
there in so long but no I definitely

274
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:32,269
there in so long but no I definitely
 

275
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:36,070
there in so long but no I definitely
want to keep doing stuff there come on

276
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
want to keep doing stuff there come on
 

277
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,699
want to keep doing stuff there come on
make it make it no very very strange

278
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:42,709
make it make it no very very strange
 

279
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,149
make it make it no very very strange
stuff alright anyway I'll have to keep

280
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:46,159
stuff alright anyway I'll have to keep
 

281
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,649
stuff alright anyway I'll have to keep
working on this hopefully we can get a

282
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:47,659
working on this hopefully we can get a
 

283
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,639
working on this hopefully we can get a
solution ok guys so before we take off

284
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:51,649
solution ok guys so before we take off
 

285
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,009
solution ok guys so before we take off
to the amplified terrain we're just

286
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:54,019
to the amplified terrain we're just
 

287
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,989
to the amplified terrain we're just
going to be chopping down some trees

288
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:55,999
going to be chopping down some trees
 

289
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,509
going to be chopping down some trees
here first or I'm going to be I need

290
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:58,519
here first or I'm going to be I need
 

291
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,409
here first or I'm going to be I need
saplings lots of these dark oak saplings

292
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:01,419
saplings lots of these dark oak saplings
 

293
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,269
saplings lots of these dark oak saplings
we also need some of this wood and I'm

294
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:04,279
we also need some of this wood and I'm
 

295
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,639
we also need some of this wood and I'm
doing an experiment here I'm curious how

296
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:06,649
doing an experiment here I'm curious how
 

297
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:08,860
doing an experiment here I'm curious how
many saplings you get on average from

298
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:08,870
many saplings you get on average from
 

299
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,249
many saplings you get on average from
one of these trees and the reason I'm

300
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:12,259
one of these trees and the reason I'm
 

301
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,800
one of these trees and the reason I'm
curious is because today

302
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:14,810
curious is because today
 

303
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,879
curious is because today
what we're gonna be doing at the

304
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:15,889
what we're gonna be doing at the
 

305
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,490
what we're gonna be doing at the
amplified terrain is building a

306
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:17,500
amplified terrain is building a
 

307
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:25,840
amplified terrain is building a
semi-automatic dark oak ah no stinking

308
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,850
semi-automatic dark oak ah no stinking
 

309
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,129
semi-automatic dark oak ah no stinking
thing man there's so much stuff in it

310
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:30,139
thing man there's so much stuff in it
 

311
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,769
thing man there's so much stuff in it
two semi-automatic dark oak tree farm

312
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:35,779
two semi-automatic dark oak tree farm
 

313
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,200
two semi-automatic dark oak tree farm
yes I spent like an hour and creative

314
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,210
yes I spent like an hour and creative
 

315
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,019
yes I spent like an hour and creative
today working out how to make one and

316
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,029
today working out how to make one and
 

317
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,820
today working out how to make one and
it's pretty good the only problem I'm

318
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:42,830
it's pretty good the only problem I'm
 

319
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,350
it's pretty good the only problem I'm
having with it is I'm not doing enough

320
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
having with it is I'm not doing enough
 

321
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,320
having with it is I'm not doing enough
saplings back from it to like keep using

322
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,330
saplings back from it to like keep using
 

323
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,600
saplings back from it to like keep using
it so it's only if I have extra dark oak

324
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,610
it so it's only if I have extra dark oak
 

325
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,620
it so it's only if I have extra dark oak
saplings that we would ever use it which

326
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:53,630
saplings that we would ever use it which
 

327
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,570
saplings that we would ever use it which
kind of stinks so I'm wondering how many

328
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:55,580
kind of stinks so I'm wondering how many
 

329
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,860
kind of stinks so I'm wondering how many
is possible from a tree on average okay

330
00:08:59,860 --> 00:08:59,870
is possible from a tree on average okay
 

331
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,370
is possible from a tree on average okay
this one's probably not an accurate

332
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:03,380
this one's probably not an accurate
 

333
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,700
this one's probably not an accurate
sample but this one I chopped down a

334
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:06,710
sample but this one I chopped down a
 

335
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,130
sample but this one I chopped down a
little earlier we got rep to four

336
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,140
little earlier we got rep to four
 

337
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,590
little earlier we got rep to four
already there's a few leaves left

338
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
already there's a few leaves left
 

339
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,890
already there's a few leaves left
so yeah I'll chop a few trees and then

340
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:14,900
so yeah I'll chop a few trees and then
 

341
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,270
so yeah I'll chop a few trees and then
we'll compare the average I chopped down

342
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,280
we'll compare the average I chopped down
 

343
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,670
we'll compare the average I chopped down
eight trees and kept track here so this

344
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
eight trees and kept track here so this
 

345
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,570
eight trees and kept track here so this
is the results we got ten from this tree

346
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:24,580
is the results we got ten from this tree
 

347
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:34,630
is the results we got ten from this tree
seven and six seven let's see what else

348
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
seven and six seven let's see what else
 

349
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,670
seven and six seven let's see what else
is there one of them I think head get

350
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:36,680
is there one of them I think head get
 

351
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,300
is there one of them I think head get
meats I think one of them had eleven

352
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,310
meats I think one of them had eleven
 

353
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,800
meats I think one of them had eleven
eleven yeah five and five so took those

354
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:44,810
eleven yeah five and five so took those
 

355
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,579
eleven yeah five and five so took those
numbers and it averages averaged out to

356
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:47,589
numbers and it averages averaged out to
 

357
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,920
numbers and it averages averaged out to
seven point three seven five from my a

358
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:50,930
seven point three seven five from my a
 

359
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,040
seven point three seven five from my a
tree sample here so on average you get

360
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,050
tree sample here so on average you get
 

361
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,620
tree sample here so on average you get
about just just a little under double

362
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:56,630
about just just a little under double
 

363
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,250
about just just a little under double
saplings back from from each tree

364
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,260
saplings back from from each tree
 

365
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,380
saplings back from from each tree
the problem is with my tree farm I'm

366
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,390
the problem is with my tree farm I'm
 

367
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,079
the problem is with my tree farm I'm
only getting about two saplings per tree

368
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:05,089
only getting about two saplings per tree
 

369
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,460
only getting about two saplings per tree
so that's like half of what I need

370
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:10,470

 

371
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,590

all right we're off to the amplified

372
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
all right we're off to the amplified
 

373
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,840
all right we're off to the amplified
terrain all right so here we are guys

374
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:17,850
terrain all right so here we are guys
 

375
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,110
terrain all right so here we are guys
it's been a very very very long time

376
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
it's been a very very very long time
 

377
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,480
it's been a very very very long time
since we were last year the problem with

378
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,490
since we were last year the problem with
 

379
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,250
since we were last year the problem with
having a base so far away it's not like

380
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,260
having a base so far away it's not like
 

381
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,140
having a base so far away it's not like
you can just pop in and do one or two

382
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,150
you can just pop in and do one or two
 

383
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,000
you can just pop in and do one or two
things or something you got to really

384
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,010
things or something you got to really
 

385
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,680
things or something you got to really
make a point of going there ah which I

386
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:33,690
make a point of going there ah which I
 

387
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,100
make a point of going there ah which I
haven't done until today until today we

388
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,110
haven't done until today until today we
 

389
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,140
haven't done until today until today we
are going to get some stuff done here so

390
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,150
are going to get some stuff done here so
 

391
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,630
are going to get some stuff done here so
I looked around I think I'm going to put

392
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:41,640
I looked around I think I'm going to put
 

393
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,710
I looked around I think I'm going to put
the tree farm down here was it here I

394
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:47,720
the tree farm down here was it here I
 

395
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,550
the tree farm down here was it here I
think it might be further down yeah I

396
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
think it might be further down yeah I
 

397
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,370
think it might be further down yeah I
think in this this light area here it's

398
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,380
think in this this light area here it's
 

399
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,150
think in this this light area here it's
gonna pick up a fair bit of space I'm

400
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,160
gonna pick up a fair bit of space I'm
 

401
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,010
gonna pick up a fair bit of space I'm
going to just build inside the hill too

402
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,020
going to just build inside the hill too
 

403
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,510
going to just build inside the hill too
because it's not really anything too

404
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:02,520
because it's not really anything too
 

405
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,570
because it's not really anything too
fancy to look at so I'm going to have to

406
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:05,580
fancy to look at so I'm going to have to
 

407
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,370
fancy to look at so I'm going to have to
clear quite a bit of land maybe I'll

408
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:09,380
clear quite a bit of land maybe I'll
 

409
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,710
clear quite a bit of land maybe I'll
start here and we'll have like a tunnel

410
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
start here and we'll have like a tunnel
 

411
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,310
start here and we'll have like a tunnel
that goes a few blocks and then we'll

412
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
that goes a few blocks and then we'll
 

413
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,710
that goes a few blocks and then we'll
have the tree I also think it's going to

414
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
have the tree I also think it's going to
 

415
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,080
have the tree I also think it's going to
be a little easier to collect the

416
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,090
be a little easier to collect the
 

417
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,580
be a little easier to collect the
saplings with it at all all being

418
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:22,590
saplings with it at all all being
 

419
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,740
saplings with it at all all being
underground like this so that's another

420
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:24,750
underground like this so that's another
 

421
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,670
underground like this so that's another
reason I'm doing it awesome so we got

422
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
reason I'm doing it awesome so we got
 

423
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,860
reason I'm doing it awesome so we got
some land cleared out here I'm going to

424
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:30,870
some land cleared out here I'm going to
 

425
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,280
some land cleared out here I'm going to
writing it through the plan idea and

426
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,290
writing it through the plan idea and
 

427
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,080
writing it through the plan idea and
then we'll start building it so the tree

428
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,090
then we'll start building it so the tree
 

429
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,390
then we'll start building it so the tree
I don't know where to put the tree I'm

430
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't know where to put the tree I'm
 

431
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,940
I don't know where to put the tree I'm
just going to put it here I didn't

432
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:40,950
just going to put it here I didn't
 

433
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,560
just going to put it here I didn't
measure anything or figure anything out

434
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,570
measure anything or figure anything out
 

435
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,300
measure anything or figure anything out
it just feels about like the right

436
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,310
it just feels about like the right
 

437
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,830
it just feels about like the right
distance so it's going to be whoa it's

438
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:48,840
distance so it's going to be whoa it's
 

439
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,290
distance so it's going to be whoa it's
going to be underground right but the

440
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,300
going to be underground right but the
 

441
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,720
going to be underground right but the
trees there we're going to push the wood

442
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:53,730
trees there we're going to push the wood
 

443
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,000
trees there we're going to push the wood
to the right and then probably make a

444
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,010
to the right and then probably make a
 

445
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,850
to the right and then probably make a
giant cube of wood over here so it's not

446
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:01,860
giant cube of wood over here so it's not
 

447
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,310
giant cube of wood over here so it's not
going to be totally underground I'm

448
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
going to be totally underground I'm
 

449
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,870
going to be totally underground I'm
going to cut away the mountain so that

450
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:05,880
going to cut away the mountain so that
 

451
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,340
going to cut away the mountain so that
you can see the giant Cuba would

452
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,350
you can see the giant Cuba would
 

453
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,250
you can see the giant Cuba would
hopefully but we're going to start

454
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
hopefully but we're going to start
 

455
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,890
hopefully but we're going to start
setting it up now the thing about these

456
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:12,900
setting it up now the thing about these
 

457
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,600
setting it up now the thing about these
dark oak trees they are extremely

458
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:16,610
dark oak trees they are extremely
 

459
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,580
dark oak trees they are extremely
destructive you have to be so careful

460
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:19,590
destructive you have to be so careful
 

461
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,369
destructive you have to be so careful
with them probably up there a bit more

462
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:23,379
with them probably up there a bit more
 

463
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:29,519
with them probably up there a bit more
here - gotta love that hey speaking all

464
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:29,529
here - gotta love that hey speaking all
 

465
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,019
here - gotta love that hey speaking all
right hopefully that's good so because

466
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,029
right hopefully that's good so because
 

467
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,239
right hopefully that's good so because
of that because they're so destructive

468
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:36,249
of that because they're so destructive
 

469
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,119
of that because they're so destructive
am I using the wrong now that's the

470
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,129
am I using the wrong now that's the
 

471
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,979
am I using the wrong now that's the
right wood it looks like spruce wood for

472
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:40,989
right wood it looks like spruce wood for
 

473
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:46,969
right wood it looks like spruce wood for
a second we can't place any like blocks

474
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:46,979
a second we can't place any like blocks
 

475
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:50,449
a second we can't place any like blocks
anywhere around like this ring here

476
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:50,459
anywhere around like this ring here
 

477
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,849
anywhere around like this ring here
except for wood if we put any other type

478
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:53,859
except for wood if we put any other type
 

479
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,710
except for wood if we put any other type
of block there or redstone or anything

480
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:55,720
of block there or redstone or anything
 

481
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,759
of block there or redstone or anything
it will get destroyed over time as the

482
00:12:59,759 --> 00:12:59,769
it will get destroyed over time as the
 

483
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,739
it will get destroyed over time as the
trees grow because either the leaf

484
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:01,749
trees grow because either the leaf
 

485
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,509
trees grow because either the leaf
blocks will replace it or the wood will

486
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
blocks will replace it or the wood will
 

487
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,419
blocks will replace it or the wood will
or something within this area so that

488
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:06,429
or something within this area so that
 

489
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,609
or something within this area so that
makes it a bit tricky these trees are

490
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:08,619
makes it a bit tricky these trees are
 

491
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,889
makes it a bit tricky these trees are
also very finicky on the growing

492
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:10,899
also very finicky on the growing
 

493
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:19,019
also very finicky on the growing
conditions um so yeah basically get our

494
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,029
conditions um so yeah basically get our
 

495
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,359
conditions um so yeah basically get our
shell all around it's probably have to

496
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:21,369
shell all around it's probably have to
 

497
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:25,349
shell all around it's probably have to
go up a little bit higher that's good

498
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:25,359
go up a little bit higher that's good
 

499
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:28,799
go up a little bit higher that's good
just a bit more all right so we got a

500
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:28,809
just a bit more all right so we got a
 

501
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,669
just a bit more all right so we got a
wood casing around the tree here if we

502
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:32,679
wood casing around the tree here if we
 

503
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,189
wood casing around the tree here if we
made this out of stone the tree would

504
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199
made this out of stone the tree would
 

505
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,949
made this out of stone the tree would
not be able to grow it's very finicky so

506
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:37,959
not be able to grow it's very finicky so
 

507
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,289
not be able to grow it's very finicky so
we have to use wood because the tree the

508
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:40,299
we have to use wood because the tree the
 

509
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:43,139
we have to use wood because the tree the
tree ignores wood when it's deciding if

510
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:43,149
tree ignores wood when it's deciding if
 

511
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,399
tree ignores wood when it's deciding if
it can grow or not we also don't want a

512
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:47,409
it can grow or not we also don't want a
 

513
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,799
it can grow or not we also don't want a
place like pistons right next to where

514
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:49,809
place like pistons right next to where
 

515
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,049
place like pistons right next to where
the the tree is going to grow because

516
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:52,059
the the tree is going to grow because
 

517
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,389
the the tree is going to grow because
these will get destroyed so we have to

518
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
these will get destroyed so we have to
 

519
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,149
these will get destroyed so we have to
go one more block out let's sit up here

520
00:13:59,149 --> 00:13:59,159
go one more block out let's sit up here
 

521
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,099
go one more block out let's sit up here
and we're going to be using sticky

522
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:02,109
and we're going to be using sticky
 

523
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,299
and we're going to be using sticky
pistons for this part

524
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:05,309

 

525
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:08,189

tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu and we go eight blocks

526
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:08,199
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu and we go eight blocks
 

527
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,840
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu and we go eight blocks
up so we want double extenders eight

528
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:12,850
up so we want double extenders eight
 

529
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,129
up so we want double extenders eight
blocks up and this is a little tricky to

530
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:17,139
blocks up and this is a little tricky to
 

531
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,989
blocks up and this is a little tricky to
get going as you can imagine alright so

532
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:21,999
get going as you can imagine alright so
 

533
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:25,519
get going as you can imagine alright so
it should look something like this

534
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:25,529

 

535
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,499

so eight blocks tall all sticky pistons

536
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:28,509
so eight blocks tall all sticky pistons
 

537
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,649
so eight blocks tall all sticky pistons
two blocks wide now we got a wire all

538
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:31,659
two blocks wide now we got a wire all
 

539
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,469
two blocks wide now we got a wire all
these which looks a little challenging

540
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:34,479
these which looks a little challenging
 

541
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:37,079
these which looks a little challenging
but it's actually not too bad on the

542
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:37,089
but it's actually not too bad on the
 

543
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,699
but it's actually not too bad on the
inside of the tree just let me let me

544
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:38,709
inside of the tree just let me let me
 

545
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,650
inside of the tree just let me let me
show you this - it's still going to be

546
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:40,660
show you this - it's still going to be
 

547
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,290
show you this - it's still going to be
wood like this but these are going to

548
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,300
wood like this but these are going to
 

549
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,989
wood like this but these are going to
push the wood blocks two blocks over so

550
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:45,999
push the wood blocks two blocks over so
 

551
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,540
push the wood blocks two blocks over so
any wood like over here is going to get

552
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,550
any wood like over here is going to get
 

553
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,759
any wood like over here is going to get
pushed two blocks to the right and then

554
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:50,769
pushed two blocks to the right and then
 

555
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,639
pushed two blocks to the right and then
when this retracts it'll be empty space

556
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:53,649
when this retracts it'll be empty space
 

557
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,780
when this retracts it'll be empty space
again so pretty cool now if you don't

558
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:57,790
again so pretty cool now if you don't
 

559
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,199
again so pretty cool now if you don't
know how to do horizontal piston

560
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,209
know how to do horizontal piston
 

561
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,999
know how to do horizontal piston
extenders these double extenders this is

562
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:03,009
extenders these double extenders this is
 

563
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,980
extenders these double extenders this is
probably the simplest way of doing it if

564
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:04,990
probably the simplest way of doing it if
 

565
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,199
probably the simplest way of doing it if
you can unfortunately we can't do that

566
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:10,209
you can unfortunately we can't do that
 

567
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,449
you can unfortunately we can't do that
because that would involve us placing a

568
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:12,459
because that would involve us placing a
 

569
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,920
because that would involve us placing a
piece of redstone in one of these

570
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:13,930
piece of redstone in one of these
 

571
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,129
piece of redstone in one of these
corners where this wood is and it would

572
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:17,139
corners where this wood is and it would
 

573
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,160
corners where this wood is and it would
get destroyed so we have to do something

574
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,170
get destroyed so we have to do something
 

575
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,910
get destroyed so we have to do something
like this

576
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:20,920
like this
 

577
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,579
like this
but slightly modified it's a little bit

578
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:23,589
but slightly modified it's a little bit
 

579
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:31,170
but slightly modified it's a little bit
bigger all right so let's start over

580
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,180
bigger all right so let's start over
 

581
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,249
bigger all right so let's start over
here each of these is going to be three

582
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:35,259
here each of these is going to be three
 

583
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:43,790
here each of these is going to be three
by three okay so basically oh man

584
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:43,800
by three okay so basically oh man
 

585
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,199
by three okay so basically oh man
memory lapse how does it work again oh

586
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:48,209
memory lapse how does it work again oh
 

587
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,939
memory lapse how does it work again oh
maybe I I think I might have done this

588
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:50,949
maybe I I think I might have done this
 

589
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,129
maybe I I think I might have done this
in the wrong spot actually the table

590
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:53,139
in the wrong spot actually the table
 

591
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:56,730
in the wrong spot actually the table
goes over here yeah okay I think that's

592
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:56,740
goes over here yeah okay I think that's
 

593
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,210
goes over here yeah okay I think that's
right

594
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,220
right
 

595
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,749
right
so repeater there and there there and

596
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:00,759
so repeater there and there there and
 

597
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,139
so repeater there and there there and
there

598
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:01,149
there
 

599
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,840
there
this one is get set to four this one at

600
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:03,850
this one is get set to four this one at
 

601
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,480
this one is get set to four this one at
two um we need a block over here and

602
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,490
two um we need a block over here and
 

603
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,179
two um we need a block over here and
redstone dust there and there and that's

604
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:12,189
redstone dust there and there and that's
 

605
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:13,980
redstone dust there and there and that's
that's all we need for the double

606
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,990
that's all we need for the double
 

607
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,569
that's all we need for the double
extender so let's try it out and we

608
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:18,579
extender so let's try it out and we
 

609
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,249
extender so let's try it out and we
might dissect the tree a couple times

610
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:20,259
might dissect the tree a couple times
 

611
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,509
might dissect the tree a couple times
throughout this just so we can see

612
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
throughout this just so we can see
 

613
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,179
throughout this just so we can see
what's happening all right so if we

614
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:24,189
what's happening all right so if we
 

615
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:29,269
what's happening all right so if we
press the button pushes the two blocks

616
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
press the button pushes the two blocks
 

617
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,210
press the button pushes the two blocks
pretty cool and retracts so the next one

618
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,220
pretty cool and retracts so the next one
 

619
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,100
pretty cool and retracts so the next one
just goes right over top of that and on

620
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,110
just goes right over top of that and on
 

621
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,809
just goes right over top of that and on
the other side we just have to mirror it

622
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:36,819
the other side we just have to mirror it
 

623
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:41,759
the other side we just have to mirror it
so do that and start on the next one and

624
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:41,769
so do that and start on the next one and
 

625
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,679
so do that and start on the next one and
then we got to connect at this point

626
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:43,689
then we got to connect at this point
 

627
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,400
then we got to connect at this point
here on every layer and when it's all

628
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,410
here on every layer and when it's all
 

629
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,620
here on every layer and when it's all
done it looks something like this so

630
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,630
done it looks something like this so
 

631
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,200
done it looks something like this so
got on both sides there's four layers

632
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,210
got on both sides there's four layers
 

633
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,890
got on both sides there's four layers
total alright oops and I connect the two

634
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:58,900
total alright oops and I connect the two
 

635
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,400
total alright oops and I connect the two
sides together by running a wire oh yeah

636
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,410
sides together by running a wire oh yeah
 

637
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,890
sides together by running a wire oh yeah
and by the way to connect vertically to

638
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:04,900
and by the way to connect vertically to
 

639
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,319
and by the way to connect vertically to
each of the layers I just have a half

640
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,329
each of the layers I just have a half
 

641
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,240
each of the layers I just have a half
slab stair chase running up and it

642
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,250
slab stair chase running up and it
 

643
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,949
slab stair chase running up and it
connects at this point at each of them

644
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
connects at this point at each of them
 

645
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,760
connects at this point at each of them
um but yeah the two sides are joined by

646
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:14,770
um but yeah the two sides are joined by
 

647
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,180
um but yeah the two sides are joined by
this wire here so if we send it a pulse

648
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,190
this wire here so if we send it a pulse
 

649
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:25,770
this wire here so if we send it a pulse
it does ha so pretty cool now if there

650
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:25,780
it does ha so pretty cool now if there
 

651
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,689
it does ha so pretty cool now if there
was a tree grown here it would do this

652
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:27,699
was a tree grown here it would do this
 

653
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,080
was a tree grown here it would do this
notice there's nothing on the side I got

654
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,090
notice there's nothing on the side I got
 

655
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,370
notice there's nothing on the side I got
to fill this hole I keep falling in it

656
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:32,380
to fill this hole I keep falling in it
 

657
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,970
to fill this hole I keep falling in it
all right

658
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:34,980
all right
 

659
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,110
all right
pushes it right through like that so

660
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
pushes it right through like that so
 

661
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,350
pushes it right through like that so
that's pretty cool so I think we should

662
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,360
that's pretty cool so I think we should
 

663
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,940
that's pretty cool so I think we should
probably try it out before we do any

664
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,950
probably try it out before we do any
 

665
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,740
probably try it out before we do any
more just to make sure it works you

666
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:43,750
more just to make sure it works you
 

667
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,240
more just to make sure it works you
never know you never know here we go

668
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,250
never know you never know here we go
 

669
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,350
never know you never know here we go
span bonemeal not a good sign

670
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
span bonemeal not a good sign
 

671
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,700
span bonemeal not a good sign
all right it could be I need more space

672
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:55,710
all right it could be I need more space
 

673
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,690
all right it could be I need more space
possibly a little worried yeah okay I'm

674
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:00,700
possibly a little worried yeah okay I'm
 

675
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,100
possibly a little worried yeah okay I'm
going to try clear more space hopefully

676
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,110
going to try clear more space hopefully
 

677
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,270
going to try clear more space hopefully
that fixes it

678
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280

 

679
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,700

aha I got it to grow here so let's push

680
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,710
aha I got it to grow here so let's push
 

681
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,390
aha I got it to grow here so let's push
a button alright that pushes the trunk

682
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
a button alright that pushes the trunk
 

683
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
a button alright that pushes the trunk
over now if we look inside yeah there's

684
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,850
over now if we look inside yeah there's
 

685
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,300
over now if we look inside yeah there's
still some wood at the very top there we

686
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,310
still some wood at the very top there we
 

687
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,770
still some wood at the very top there we
can't really get that layer because if

688
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:22,780
can't really get that layer because if
 

689
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,400
can't really get that layer because if
we build this piston or a any higher the

690
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,410
we build this piston or a any higher the
 

691
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,660
we build this piston or a any higher the
tree is not going to grow it's going to

692
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:27,670
tree is not going to grow it's going to
 

693
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,410
tree is not going to grow it's going to
be in the way so eight boxes the limit

694
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:31,420
be in the way so eight boxes the limit
 

695
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,380
be in the way so eight boxes the limit
here um I was having trouble with

696
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,390
here um I was having trouble with
 

697
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,060
here um I was having trouble with
getting it to grow I think possibly

698
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,070
getting it to grow I think possibly
 

699
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,320
getting it to grow I think possibly
because it was dark

700
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,330
because it was dark
 

701
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,950
because it was dark
oh no it's growing now I just I cleared

702
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
oh no it's growing now I just I cleared
 

703
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,780
oh no it's growing now I just I cleared
up cleared out enough space and it works

704
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:42,790
up cleared out enough space and it works
 

705
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,720
up cleared out enough space and it works
now I wasn't sure so most the time it

706
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:48,730
now I wasn't sure so most the time it
 

707
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,900
now I wasn't sure so most the time it
doesn't grow that tall anyway um so next

708
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:51,910
doesn't grow that tall anyway um so next
 

709
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,810
doesn't grow that tall anyway um so next
thing we're going to do we got to add

710
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:53,820
thing we're going to do we got to add
 

711
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,490
thing we're going to do we got to add
something in here to shear the leaves as

712
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:56,500
something in here to shear the leaves as
 

713
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,490
something in here to shear the leaves as
much as possible and this is something I

714
00:18:59,490 --> 00:18:59,500
much as possible and this is something I
 

715
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,520
much as possible and this is something I
probably can improve on still with my

716
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,530
probably can improve on still with my
 

717
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,870
probably can improve on still with my
design

718
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:03,880
design
 

719
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,860
design
but I'll show you what I figured out

720
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:05,870
but I'll show you what I figured out
 

721
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:12,600
but I'll show you what I figured out
before I think we have to connect where

722
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:12,610
before I think we have to connect where
 

723
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,990
before I think we have to connect where
let's see I think okay clouds you have

724
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,000
let's see I think okay clouds you have
 

725
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,590
let's see I think okay clouds you have
had your day you've had your fun you you

726
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,600
had your day you've had your fun you you
 

727
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:28,779
had your day you've had your fun you you
be gone now I think starting from one to

728
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:28,789
be gone now I think starting from one to
 

729
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:32,409
be gone now I think starting from one to
three down if we put a piece of stone

730
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:32,419
three down if we put a piece of stone
 

731
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,909
three down if we put a piece of stone
right there is where we want to start

732
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
right there is where we want to start
 

733
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,140
right there is where we want to start
and this goes out like this and I think

734
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,150
and this goes out like this and I think
 

735
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,460
and this goes out like this and I think
like that and then run wire over top

736
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:42,470
like that and then run wire over top
 

737
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,899
like that and then run wire over top
this oh did I not I do have pistons good

738
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:46,909
this oh did I not I do have pistons good
 

739
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:47,919
this oh did I not I do have pistons good
good good

740
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:47,929
good good
 

741
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,860
good good
I planned ahead oh but I can't place

742
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:50,870
I planned ahead oh but I can't place
 

743
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,890
I planned ahead oh but I can't place
them all right it's going to be

744
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:53,900
them all right it's going to be
 

745
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,649
them all right it's going to be
challenging so now we're going to have a

746
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:56,659
challenging so now we're going to have a
 

747
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,990
challenging so now we're going to have a
big wall of Pistons running up here and

748
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,000
big wall of Pistons running up here and
 

749
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,600
big wall of Pistons running up here and
these are going to extend and shear any

750
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:01,610
these are going to extend and shear any
 

751
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,880
these are going to extend and shear any
leaves that they touch and drop the

752
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:03,890
leaves that they touch and drop the
 

753
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,080
leaves that they touch and drop the
saplings all right I think that's it

754
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,090
saplings all right I think that's it
 

755
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,770
saplings all right I think that's it
again if we have any blocks in this area

756
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:11,780
again if we have any blocks in this area
 

757
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,740
again if we have any blocks in this area
I don't think the tree will grow so we

758
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,750
I don't think the tree will grow so we
 

759
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,740
I don't think the tree will grow so we
have to be careful and we're going to go

760
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,750
have to be careful and we're going to go
 

761
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:24,970
have to be careful and we're going to go
up three layers total and now that I've

762
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:24,980
up three layers total and now that I've
 

763
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,159
up three layers total and now that I've
added those leaf crushers it looks like

764
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:27,169
added those leaf crushers it looks like
 

765
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:32,740
added those leaf crushers it looks like
this so that is five blocks tall one two

766
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:32,750
this so that is five blocks tall one two
 

767
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,840
this so that is five blocks tall one two
three four and then another one here so

768
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:34,850
three four and then another one here so
 

769
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,460
three four and then another one here so
five wide five by five right yeah 25 and

770
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,470
five wide five by five right yeah 25 and
 

771
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,440
five wide five by five right yeah 25 and
per side that gets some leaves not

772
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,450
per side that gets some leaves not
 

773
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,380
per side that gets some leaves not
nearly all of them though and because of

774
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,390
nearly all of them though and because of
 

775
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,870
nearly all of them though and because of
all our contraption stuff not as many

776
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:49,880
all our contraption stuff not as many
 

777
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,120
all our contraption stuff not as many
leaves spawn when the tree grows so that

778
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,130
leaves spawn when the tree grows so that
 

779
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,810
leaves spawn when the tree grows so that
is where our deficiency is coming in and

780
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:54,820
is where our deficiency is coming in and
 

781
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,940
is where our deficiency is coming in and
I might look into improving this more

782
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:57,950
I might look into improving this more
 

783
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,450
I might look into improving this more
later let me just show you the top two

784
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,460
later let me just show you the top two
 

785
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,240
later let me just show you the top two
to give you an idea of one area where I

786
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,250
to give you an idea of one area where I
 

787
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,779
to give you an idea of one area where I
might try to improve it yeah at the very

788
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:07,789
might try to improve it yeah at the very
 

789
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,330
might try to improve it yeah at the very
top here we have all these leaves that

790
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,340
top here we have all these leaves that
 

791
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,669
top here we have all these leaves that
if I could crush these and somehow

792
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:12,679
if I could crush these and somehow
 

793
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,400
if I could crush these and somehow
collect them we would get

794
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,410
collect them we would get
 

795
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:22,910
collect them we would get
um well at least 25 more more than that

796
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:22,920
um well at least 25 more more than that
 

797
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,950
um well at least 25 more more than that
more than that this is a lot of a lot of

798
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
more than that this is a lot of a lot of
 

799
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,770
more than that this is a lot of a lot of
leaves isn't it the only problem is I

800
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:27,780
leaves isn't it the only problem is I
 

801
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,650
leaves isn't it the only problem is I
believe if there's a block at this level

802
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:30,660
believe if there's a block at this level
 

803
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,010
believe if there's a block at this level
here and I think even this one here the

804
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,020
here and I think even this one here the
 

805
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,170
here and I think even this one here the
tree won't grow so we would have to have

806
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,180
tree won't grow so we would have to have
 

807
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,360
tree won't grow so we would have to have
like a double extender going down

808
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,370
like a double extender going down
 

809
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,990
like a double extender going down
somehow for it to work and the tree to

810
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
somehow for it to work and the tree to
 

811
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,450
somehow for it to work and the tree to
still grow to crush these leaves which

812
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:44,460
still grow to crush these leaves which
 

813
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,990
still grow to crush these leaves which
is a little challenging um

814
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,000
is a little challenging um
 

815
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,930
is a little challenging um
anyway maybe we should give it a try and

816
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:50,940
anyway maybe we should give it a try and
 

817
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,090
anyway maybe we should give it a try and
by the way the nice thing about these

818
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,100
by the way the nice thing about these
 

819
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,310
by the way the nice thing about these
crushers here I don't have to really

820
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,320
crushers here I don't have to really
 

821
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,710
crushers here I don't have to really
connect anything to them or do anything

822
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720
connect anything to them or do anything
 

823
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,290
connect anything to them or do anything
fancy because they connect directly from

824
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:00,300
fancy because they connect directly from
 

825
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,270
fancy because they connect directly from
this staircase here it powers them so

826
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,280
this staircase here it powers them so
 

827
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,860
this staircase here it powers them so
the thing that pushes the tree trunk

828
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:06,870
the thing that pushes the tree trunk
 

829
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,500
the thing that pushes the tree trunk
over also activates the crushers for the

830
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:09,510
over also activates the crushers for the
 

831
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:15,550
over also activates the crushers for the
leaves and oh do I have any blocks here

832
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:15,560
leaves and oh do I have any blocks here
 

833
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,870
leaves and oh do I have any blocks here
run it one more time here alright is it

834
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
run it one more time here alright is it
 

835
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
run it one more time here alright is it
going to grow no that would have been

836
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,370
going to grow no that would have been
 

837
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,460
going to grow no that would have been
very lucky if we did I got more bonemeal

838
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,470
very lucky if we did I got more bonemeal
 

839
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,720
very lucky if we did I got more bonemeal
over here set up a little workstation

840
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:28,730
over here set up a little workstation
 

841
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,610
over here set up a little workstation
I'll probably move this jump pad over

842
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:31,620
I'll probably move this jump pad over
 

843
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,990
I'll probably move this jump pad over
here and get rid of it and is there

844
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
here and get rid of it and is there
 

845
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,430
here and get rid of it and is there
anything in the way nope we're good

846
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
anything in the way nope we're good
 

847
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,990
anything in the way nope we're good
still so hmm it's not going to crush

848
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,000
still so hmm it's not going to crush
 

849
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,040
still so hmm it's not going to crush
many leaves it looks like only 10 this

850
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,050
many leaves it looks like only 10 this
 

851
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,220
many leaves it looks like only 10 this
was a very tall tree I might need to

852
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,230
was a very tall tree I might need to
 

853
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,990
was a very tall tree I might need to
build this up higher actually yeah it's

854
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,000
build this up higher actually yeah it's
 

855
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,640
build this up higher actually yeah it's
not going to get very many here uh-huh

856
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:01,650
not going to get very many here uh-huh
 

857
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,410
not going to get very many here uh-huh
but one thing we could do for collecting

858
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:06,420
but one thing we could do for collecting
 

859
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,120
but one thing we could do for collecting
them is run hoppers maybe this way I

860
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,130
them is run hoppers maybe this way I
 

861
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,420
them is run hoppers maybe this way I
don't know something like this and then

862
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,430
don't know something like this and then
 

863
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,610
don't know something like this and then
any saplings that fall will hopefully

864
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:16,620
any saplings that fall will hopefully
 

865
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,410
any saplings that fall will hopefully
land on these hoppers and end up at the

866
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:18,420
land on these hoppers and end up at the
 

867
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,970
land on these hoppers and end up at the
front here but yeah that's basically it

868
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:22,980
front here but yeah that's basically it
 

869
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,570
front here but yeah that's basically it
for right now then all this wood is

870
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,580
for right now then all this wood is
 

871
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,130
for right now then all this wood is
going to get collected into a giant

872
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,140
going to get collected into a giant
 

873
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,409
going to get collected into a giant
clump hope hopefully but I haven't

874
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:30,419
clump hope hopefully but I haven't
 

875
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,269
clump hope hopefully but I haven't
figure that out yet but it'll probably

876
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:32,279
figure that out yet but it'll probably
 

877
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,919
figure that out yet but it'll probably
get pushed to the left here and then

878
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:33,929
get pushed to the left here and then
 

879
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:39,619
get pushed to the left here and then
forward somehow uh-huh so if we want to

880
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:39,629
forward somehow uh-huh so if we want to
 

881
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,629
forward somehow uh-huh so if we want to
clean up this area too if we want it to

882
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:41,639
clean up this area too if we want it to
 

883
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:46,009
clean up this area too if we want it to
look a little nicer we can hide it kind

884
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:46,019
look a little nicer we can hide it kind
 

885
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:52,580
look a little nicer we can hide it kind
of like this you know and yeah that way

886
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:52,590
of like this you know and yeah that way
 

887
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,529
of like this you know and yeah that way
we don't see any redstone wiring if we

888
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:54,539
we don't see any redstone wiring if we
 

889
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,710
we don't see any redstone wiring if we
want to hide all that and it'll just be

890
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:57,720
want to hide all that and it'll just be
 

891
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,269
want to hide all that and it'll just be
like a little tunnel we enter alright

892
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:02,279
like a little tunnel we enter alright
 

893
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,769
like a little tunnel we enter alright
guys so that is probably going to be

894
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:03,779
guys so that is probably going to be
 

895
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,599
guys so that is probably going to be
about it for today but we're going to do

896
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:05,609
about it for today but we're going to do
 

897
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,090
about it for today but we're going to do
just a little bit of trading here too

898
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,100
just a little bit of trading here too
 

899
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,070
just a little bit of trading here too
we got a new librarian in the village I

900
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
we got a new librarian in the village I
 

901
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,669
we got a new librarian in the village I
want to see what we can unlock let's do

902
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
want to see what we can unlock let's do
 

903
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,489
want to see what we can unlock let's do
this maybe we will do the common thing

904
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:16,499
this maybe we will do the common thing
 

905
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:19,489
this maybe we will do the common thing
as I do it so last episode I talked

906
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:19,499
as I do it so last episode I talked
 

907
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,940
as I do it so last episode I talked
about how maybe pressure plates and and

908
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:22,950
about how maybe pressure plates and and
 

909
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,830
about how maybe pressure plates and and
that kind of stuff buttons and whatever

910
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:24,840
that kind of stuff buttons and whatever
 

911
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,049
that kind of stuff buttons and whatever
should be able to be placed on glass

912
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:27,059
should be able to be placed on glass
 

913
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,769
should be able to be placed on glass
right got this reply it says glass

914
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:30,779
right got this reply it says glass
 

915
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,019
right got this reply it says glass
doesn't allow redstone power to flow

916
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:33,029
doesn't allow redstone power to flow
 

917
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:35,389
doesn't allow redstone power to flow
through so a pressure plate on glass for

918
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:35,399
through so a pressure plate on glass for
 

919
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:36,830
through so a pressure plate on glass for
the traditional sense it would be

920
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
the traditional sense it would be
 

921
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,649
the traditional sense it would be
pointless though for your instance I

922
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:39,659
pointless though for your instance I
 

923
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,859
pointless though for your instance I
wish it would I had a few people comment

924
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:42,869
wish it would I had a few people comment
 

925
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,529
wish it would I had a few people comment
about the whole like pressure plates on

926
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:45,539
about the whole like pressure plates on
 

927
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,460
about the whole like pressure plates on
glass thing so there is an instance in

928
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:49,470
glass thing so there is an instance in
 

929
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,460
glass thing so there is an instance in
the game where something similar is done

930
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,470
the game where something similar is done
 

931
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,529
the game where something similar is done
you can put pressure plates on fences

932
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:54,539
you can put pressure plates on fences
 

933
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,330
you can put pressure plates on fences
right the fences don't actually get

934
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,340
right the fences don't actually get
 

935
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,430
right the fences don't actually get
powered from it if you were to put

936
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,440
powered from it if you were to put
 

937
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,690
powered from it if you were to put
pressure plates on glass it would be

938
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:02,700
pressure plates on glass it would be
 

939
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,249
pressure plates on glass it would be
pretty much the same thing you couldn't

940
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:04,259
pretty much the same thing you couldn't
 

941
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,669
pretty much the same thing you couldn't
pull power from the glass block like if

942
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
pull power from the glass block like if
 

943
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,330
pull power from the glass block like if
you put a repeater by it but you know it

944
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,340
you put a repeater by it but you know it
 

945
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,549
you put a repeater by it but you know it
just adds a little extra something you

946
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:13,559
just adds a little extra something you
 

947
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,159
just adds a little extra something you
can do or a little extra flexibility in

948
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:16,169
can do or a little extra flexibility in
 

949
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:18,619
can do or a little extra flexibility in
