00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
checking out the amplified terrain
 

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,529
checking out the amplified terrain
looking around trying to find the last

14
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:27,539
looking around trying to find the last
 

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,950

few things I need on my list and long
and behold I almost did not see this I I

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:34,950
and behold I almost did not see this I I
 

19
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,280
and behold I almost did not see this I I
was like I ender pearled right into it

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,290
was like I ender pearled right into it
 

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,400
was like I ender pearled right into it
but yeah Mesa biome unreal so lucky I I

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,410
but yeah Mesa biome unreal so lucky I I
 

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,529
but yeah Mesa biome unreal so lucky I I
was really shocked I found one I didn't

24
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:45,539
was really shocked I found one I didn't
 

25
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,229
was really shocked I found one I didn't
think I would and it's really close to

26
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
think I would and it's really close to
 

27
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,220
think I would and it's really close to
my spawn actually it's only about 3,000

28
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,230
my spawn actually it's only about 3,000
 

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,819
my spawn actually it's only about 3,000
blocks out maybe a little bit further so

30
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:55,829
blocks out maybe a little bit further so
 

31
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,040
blocks out maybe a little bit further so
I'm gonna set up a portal here and I'm

32
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,050
I'm gonna set up a portal here and I'm
 

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,779
I'm gonna set up a portal here and I'm
going to take it all down all this clay

34
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:02,789
going to take it all down all this clay
 

35
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,260
going to take it all down all this clay
is gonna be gone even though it looks

36
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,270
is gonna be gone even though it looks
 

37
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,780
is gonna be gone even though it looks
nice it's going to be destroyed oh yeah

38
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:11,790
nice it's going to be destroyed oh yeah
 

39
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,289
nice it's going to be destroyed oh yeah
so unfortunately though even though I'm

40
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:15,299
so unfortunately though even though I'm
 

41
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,090
so unfortunately though even though I'm
really happy I found a Mesa biome it is

42
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
really happy I found a Mesa biome it is
 

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,420
really happy I found a Mesa biome it is
a really small one or at least its it

44
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,430
a really small one or at least its it
 

45
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,550
a really small one or at least its it
might be deceptively small it looks it

46
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
might be deceptively small it looks it
 

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,929
might be deceptively small it looks it
looks like it's pretty small though um

48
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:25,939
looks like it's pretty small though um
 

49
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,609
looks like it's pretty small though um
but I think I think there's a lot of

50
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:28,619
but I think I think there's a lot of
 

51
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,620
but I think I think there's a lot of
clay here actually it just doesn't look

52
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:30,630
clay here actually it just doesn't look
 

53
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,319
clay here actually it just doesn't look
like much because it's like very

54
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
like much because it's like very
 

55
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,190
like much because it's like very
vertical there's gonna be clay in here

56
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
vertical there's gonna be clay in here
 

57
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,420
vertical there's gonna be clay in here
all the way down to y 64 so yeah there's

58
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,430
all the way down to y 64 so yeah there's
 

59
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,560
all the way down to y 64 so yeah there's
there's probably a lot here and I just

60
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
there's probably a lot here and I just
 

61
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,780
there's probably a lot here and I just
don't realize it but I'm gonna keep

62
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,790
don't realize it but I'm gonna keep
 

63
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,670
don't realize it but I'm gonna keep
looking around maybe I'll find another

64
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
looking around maybe I'll find another
 

65
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,039
looking around maybe I'll find another
Mesa because we're still in the dry area

66
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,049
Mesa because we're still in the dry area
 

67
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,940
Mesa because we're still in the dry area
and I'm about getting ready to head back

68
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:52,950
and I'm about getting ready to head back
 

69
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,310
and I'm about getting ready to head back
and do some build in here but I also

70
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
and do some build in here but I also
 

71
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,480
and do some build in here but I also
want to find the dark oak saplings so I

72
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,490
want to find the dark oak saplings so I
 

73
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,639
want to find the dark oak saplings so I
need to find a roof what's it called the

74
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:01,649
need to find a roof what's it called the
 

75
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,819
need to find a roof what's it called the
roofed forest out whatever it's the one

76
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:04,829
roofed forest out whatever it's the one
 

77
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,260
roofed forest out whatever it's the one
with the mushrooms in it you know what

78
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,270
with the mushrooms in it you know what
 

79
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,580
with the mushrooms in it you know what
I'm talking about but yeah this is

80
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590
I'm talking about but yeah this is
 

81
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm talking about but yeah this is
really cool I'm glad I found this very

82
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,410
really cool I'm glad I found this very
 

83
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,979
really cool I'm glad I found this very
cool and it's right next to yeah maybe

84
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:12,989
cool and it's right next to yeah maybe
 

85
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,880
cool and it's right next to yeah maybe
we'll check this out

86
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:13,890
we'll check this out
 

87
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,730
we'll check this out
it's next to a desert so that means I'll

88
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:16,740
it's next to a desert so that means I'll
 

89
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,380
it's next to a desert so that means I'll
probably be getting my sand from here

90
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,390
probably be getting my sand from here
 

91
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,960
probably be getting my sand from here
from now on too because I'm guessing

92
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,970
from now on too because I'm guessing
 

93
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,570
from now on too because I'm guessing
it's a lot easier to collect sand from

94
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,580
it's a lot easier to collect sand from
 

95
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,190
it's a lot easier to collect sand from
this kind of stuff than my other areas

96
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,200
this kind of stuff than my other areas
 

97
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,020
this kind of stuff than my other areas
although okay so there's tons of

98
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,030
although okay so there's tons of
 

99
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,540
although okay so there's tons of
sandstone it's thinking I might be able

100
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,550
sandstone it's thinking I might be able
 

101
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,010
sandstone it's thinking I might be able
to do the torch trick but maybe not so

102
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,020
to do the torch trick but maybe not so
 

103
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,030
to do the torch trick but maybe not so
it looks like it's mostly all sandstone

104
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,040
it looks like it's mostly all sandstone
 

105
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,180
it looks like it's mostly all sandstone
hmm

106
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,190
hmm
 

107
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,140
hmm
let's go over here I was hoping I could

108
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,150
let's go over here I was hoping I could
 

109
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,330
let's go over here I was hoping I could
just put a torch down and like 30 blocks

110
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
just put a torch down and like 30 blocks
 

111
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,979
just put a torch down and like 30 blocks
of sand would just fall on it but I

112
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:48,989
of sand would just fall on it but I
 

113
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,290
of sand would just fall on it but I
don't think that's actually gonna happen

114
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,300

 

115
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,670

I'm running out of ender pearls too so I

116
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm running out of ender pearls too so I
 

117
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,090
I'm running out of ender pearls too so I
gotta head back soon where did we go

118
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,100
gotta head back soon where did we go
 

119
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,640
gotta head back soon where did we go
okay so yeah it looks like it's not much

120
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,650
okay so yeah it looks like it's not much
 

121
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,190
okay so yeah it looks like it's not much
different than a normal desert actually

122
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
different than a normal desert actually
 

123
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,199
different than a normal desert actually
because if I put a torch here like

124
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,209
because if I put a torch here like
 

125
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,780
because if I put a torch here like
that's not that's not anything yeah darn

126
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:14,790
that's not that's not anything yeah darn
 

127
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,509
that's not that's not anything yeah darn
it be really cool if you could get like

128
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
it be really cool if you could get like
 

129
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,670
it be really cool if you could get like
40 or 50 blocks the sand falling on it

130
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
40 or 50 blocks the sand falling on it
 

131
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,420
40 or 50 blocks the sand falling on it
every time but a good place to get

132
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,430
every time but a good place to get
 

133
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,970
every time but a good place to get
sandstone anyway so I'm gonna keep doing

134
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:25,980
sandstone anyway so I'm gonna keep doing
 

135
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,979
sandstone anyway so I'm gonna keep doing
a little bit more exploring and I will

136
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:27,989
a little bit more exploring and I will
 

137
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,039
a little bit more exploring and I will
turn you guys in on any other important

138
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,049
turn you guys in on any other important
 

139
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,509
turn you guys in on any other important
discoveries I make such as this one

140
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:34,519
discoveries I make such as this one
 

141
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,210
discoveries I make such as this one
woohoo there is a lot more to this this

142
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,220
woohoo there is a lot more to this this
 

143
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,550
woohoo there is a lot more to this this
Mesa biome than I thought I I climbed

144
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
Mesa biome than I thought I I climbed
 

145
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,130
Mesa biome than I thought I I climbed
this hill cuz like down there this is

146
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,140
this hill cuz like down there this is
 

147
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,380
this hill cuz like down there this is
all I could see was this hill the top of

148
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,390
all I could see was this hill the top of
 

149
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,789
all I could see was this hill the top of
it I didn't think there was more to it I

150
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
it I didn't think there was more to it I
 

151
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,819
it I didn't think there was more to it I
thought we went back to the desert over

152
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:49,829
thought we went back to the desert over
 

153
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,270
thought we went back to the desert over
here or something but no no it it keeps

154
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
here or something but no no it it keeps
 

155
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,490
here or something but no no it it keeps
going here so this is awesome okay so it

156
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
going here so this is awesome okay so it
 

157
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,860
going here so this is awesome okay so it
must have got yeah I kind of I guess it

158
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:00,870
must have got yeah I kind of I guess it
 

159
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,370
must have got yeah I kind of I guess it
kind of gets narrow oh maybe not I think

160
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,380
kind of gets narrow oh maybe not I think
 

161
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,069
kind of gets narrow oh maybe not I think
it was all that grass down there that's

162
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,079
it was all that grass down there that's
 

163
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,630
it was all that grass down there that's
threw me off it looked like the biome

164
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
threw me off it looked like the biome
 

165
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,030
threw me off it looked like the biome
ended but it just keeps going and going

166
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
ended but it just keeps going and going
 

167
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,750
ended but it just keeps going and going
and it looks really weird I don't know

168
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760
and it looks really weird I don't know
 

169
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,259
and it looks really weird I don't know
if I've seen this this must be a oh it's

nighttime a variant of the Mesa biome

172

nighttime a variant of the Mesa biome
 

173
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,009
nighttime a variant of the Mesa biome
because there's like grass and stuff

174
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,019
because there's like grass and stuff
 

175
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,250
because there's like grass and stuff
here it's nighttime I tell ya night

go check this out is this part of the

186
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
go check this out is this part of the
 

187
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,240
go check this out is this part of the
Mesa or is this something different

188
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,250

 

189
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,400

Mesa plat to plateau F okay so there's

190
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,410
Mesa plat to plateau F okay so there's
 

191
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,810
Mesa plat to plateau F okay so there's
actually grass here trees very very

00:04:59,810 --> 00:04:59,820
actually grass here trees very very
 

193
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,690
actually grass here trees very very
Brown trees as you would expect ah yes I

194
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:05,700
Brown trees as you would expect ah yes I
 

195
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,210
Brown trees as you would expect ah yes I
am very happy okay so I got enough clay

196
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,220
am very happy okay so I got enough clay
 

197
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,140
am very happy okay so I got enough clay

ender prone you get stuck in a block
 

203
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:27,500
ender prone you get stuck in a block
like that oh okay oh yes oh yes keep

204
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,510
like that oh okay oh yes oh yes keep
 

205
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,610

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,620
keep going never stop chances are I'm
 

207
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,650
keep going never stop chances are I'm
not gonna find another maid Mesa biome

208
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:33,660
not gonna find another maid Mesa biome
 

209
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,770
not gonna find another maid Mesa biome
honestly I don't do like after this

210
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
honestly I don't do like after this
 

211
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,180
honestly I don't do like after this
exploring here I'm not really planning

212
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,190
exploring here I'm not really planning
 

213
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,050
exploring here I'm not really planning
on doing that ton more I didn't find the

214
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,060
on doing that ton more I didn't find the
 

215
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,250
on doing that ton more I didn't find the
2x2 taiga forest whatever its called yet

216
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,260
2x2 taiga forest whatever its called yet
 

217
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,430
2x2 taiga forest whatever its called yet
with the podzol and I need the roof

218
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
with the podzol and I need the roof
 

219
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
with the podzol and I need the roof
forest and once I get those two things

220
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,090
forest and once I get those two things
 

221
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,380
forest and once I get those two things
I'm probably close to done although

222
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,390
I'm probably close to done although
 

223
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm probably close to done although
there's also the packed ice I could get

224
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,490
there's also the packed ice I could get
 

225
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,830
there's also the packed ice I could get
from a snow biome but I wouldn't mind

226
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
from a snow biome but I wouldn't mind
 

227
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,430
from a snow biome but I wouldn't mind
finding that too and then then why don't

228
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
finding that too and then then why don't
 

229
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
finding that too and then then why don't
we get all those things we're like done

230
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:02,970
we get all those things we're like done
 

231
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,780
we get all those things we're like done
exploring for a long time probably

232
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:04,790
exploring for a long time probably
 

233
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,950
exploring for a long time probably
because we got plenty of building

234
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
because we got plenty of building
 

235
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,490
because we got plenty of building
potential a lot of building sites we

236
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:10,500
potential a lot of building sites we
 

237
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,950
potential a lot of building sites we
found that would work out great so we

238
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
found that would work out great so we
 

239
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,300
found that would work out great so we
don't really need to look for more and

240
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,310
don't really need to look for more and
 

241
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,520
don't really need to look for more and
that is a huge Mesa oh that's cool

242
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,530
that is a huge Mesa oh that's cool
 

243
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:29,470
that is a huge Mesa oh that's cool
that's like it's like a cannon almost I

244
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,480
that's like it's like a cannon almost I
 

245
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,940
that's like it's like a cannon almost I
bet that's this is probably different

246
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:31,950
bet that's this is probably different
 

247
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,760
bet that's this is probably different
from okay so this is just regular Mesa

248
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,770
from okay so this is just regular Mesa
 

249
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,420
from okay so this is just regular Mesa
oh maybe not something usually like

250
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,430
oh maybe not something usually like
 

251
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,550
oh maybe not something usually like
between biomes there's a river that will

252
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
between biomes there's a river that will
 

253
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,090
between biomes there's a river that will
split them

254
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,100
split them
 

255
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,070
split them
or like it it'll go down then it'll go

256
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080
or like it it'll go down then it'll go
 

257
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,340
or like it it'll go down then it'll go
back up like that but it might just be a

258
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,350
back up like that but it might just be a
 

259
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:53,780
back up like that but it might just be a
river running through man I think I saw

260
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:53,790
river running through man I think I saw
 

261
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,000
river running through man I think I saw
some of the red sand down there too like

262
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,010
some of the red sand down there too like
 

263
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,950
some of the red sand down there too like
where we started there so I think I got

264
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:57,960
where we started there so I think I got
 

265
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,530
where we started there so I think I got
that Wow

266
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,540
that Wow
 

267
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,900
that Wow
holy smokes it's huge absolutely huge oh

268
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,910
holy smokes it's huge absolutely huge oh
 

269
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,650
holy smokes it's huge absolutely huge oh
and it keeps going very cool

270
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:14,660
and it keeps going very cool
 

271
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,240
and it keeps going very cool
just keeps going and going that's over a

272
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,250
just keeps going and going that's over a
 

273
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,000
just keeps going and going that's over a
thousand blocks long I bet oh what's

274
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,010
thousand blocks long I bet oh what's
 

275
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,250
thousand blocks long I bet oh what's
going on here seems like there's a lot

276
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,260
going on here seems like there's a lot
 

277
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,030
going on here seems like there's a lot
more grass still plant Mesa plateau

278
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,040
more grass still plant Mesa plateau
 

279
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,850
more grass still plant Mesa plateau
plateau F I always say plat 2 keeps

280
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:34,860
plateau F I always say plat 2 keeps
 

281
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,440
plateau F I always say plat 2 keeps
going woohoo

282
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,450
going woohoo
 

283
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,330
going woohoo
so if I want to build in a Mesa biome it

284
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
so if I want to build in a Mesa biome it
 

285
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,670
so if I want to build in a Mesa biome it
looks like I'll have opportunity to do

286
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
looks like I'll have opportunity to do
 

287
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,490
looks like I'll have opportunity to do
that too there's plenty of space here

288
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:45,500

 

289
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,740

cool cool anyway we've seen it let's go

290
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:48,750
cool cool anyway we've seen it let's go
 

291
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,660
cool cool anyway we've seen it let's go
let's go do something else here alright

292
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:53,670
let's go do something else here alright
 

293
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,490
let's go do something else here alright
so I walked to the very end of the Mesa

294
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,500
so I walked to the very end of the Mesa
 

295
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,440
so I walked to the very end of the Mesa
biome and it is gigantic it is I'm at

296
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,450
biome and it is gigantic it is I'm at
 

297
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,500
biome and it is gigantic it is I'm at
ex- 438 I think we started at an ex-

298
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,510
ex- 438 I think we started at an ex-
 

299
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,590
ex- 438 I think we started at an ex-
2,000 or so so it's over 1,500 blocks

300
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:06,600
2,000 or so so it's over 1,500 blocks
 

301
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,040
2,000 or so so it's over 1,500 blocks
long and then I started seeing this and

302
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,050
long and then I started seeing this and
 

303
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,680
long and then I started seeing this and
I'm like what that doesn't make sense

304
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,690
I'm like what that doesn't make sense
 

305
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm like what that doesn't make sense
III didn't think Mesa biomes could spawn

306
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:14,970
III didn't think Mesa biomes could spawn
 

307
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,600
III didn't think Mesa biomes could spawn
next to like the pine forest stuff taiga

308
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,610
next to like the pine forest stuff taiga
 

309
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,410
next to like the pine forest stuff taiga
and then I look over and what is going

310
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:24,420
and then I look over and what is going
 

311
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,250
and then I look over and what is going
on and yeah so I guess this is where

312
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,260
on and yeah so I guess this is where
 

313
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,000
on and yeah so I guess this is where
this is land I explored previous to this

314
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,010
this is land I explored previous to this
 

315
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,459
this is land I explored previous to this
update I hit a wall here otherwise it

316
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:34,469
update I hit a wall here otherwise it
 

317
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,529
update I hit a wall here otherwise it
would have kept going for sure and I

318
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:39,539
would have kept going for sure and I
 

319
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,450
would have kept going for sure and I
might go down there and just check if it

320
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:41,460
might go down there and just check if it
 

321
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,670
might go down there and just check if it
continues on the other side or something

322
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
continues on the other side or something
 

323
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,650
continues on the other side or something
if I just cut a line through there

324
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:45,660
if I just cut a line through there
 

325
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,050
if I just cut a line through there
somewhere but out this way is ocean by

326
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,060
somewhere but out this way is ocean by
 

327
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,500
somewhere but out this way is ocean by
the looks of it I'm sure it goes like to

328
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,510
the looks of it I'm sure it goes like to
 

329
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,040
the looks of it I'm sure it goes like to
the right and

330
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,050
the right and
 

331
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,870
the right and
I didn't check that is one like that

332
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
I didn't check that is one like that
 

333
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,139
I didn't check that is one like that
these two directions east and west over

334
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:00,149
these two directions east and west over
 

335
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,380
these two directions east and west over
here we have one of the new jungle

336
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:02,390
here we have one of the new jungle
 

337
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,940
here we have one of the new jungle
biomes that's from that's amplified

338
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:04,950
biomes that's from that's amplified
 

339
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,320
biomes that's from that's amplified
terrain

340
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,330
terrain
 

341
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,300
terrain
so let's this let's just head over to

342
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,310
so let's this let's just head over to
 

343
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,430
so let's this let's just head over to
the other side I'm curious to see I'm

344
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,440
the other side I'm curious to see I'm
 

345
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,139
the other side I'm curious to see I'm
guessing it I explored a lot before

346
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:15,149
guessing it I explored a lot before
 

347
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,790
guessing it I explored a lot before
otherwise the Mesa would probably

348
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
otherwise the Mesa would probably
 

349
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,350
otherwise the Mesa would probably
continue on the other side here got

350
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
continue on the other side here got
 

351
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:30,290
continue on the other side here got
wolves nighttime and these walls even if

352
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,300
wolves nighttime and these walls even if
 

353
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,819
wolves nighttime and these walls even if
I wasn't an amplified terrain I would

354
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:31,829
I wasn't an amplified terrain I would
 

355
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,740
I wasn't an amplified terrain I would
still get those so that's not the cause

356
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:33,750
still get those so that's not the cause
 

357
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,860
still get those so that's not the cause
of them it's just because there's 1.7

358
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:36,870
of them it's just because there's 1.7
 

359
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,680
of them it's just because there's 1.7
generation in an old world here yeah

360
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:42,690
generation in an old world here yeah
 

361
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:49,940
generation in an old world here yeah
must have explored all this before okay

362
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:49,950
must have explored all this before okay
 

363
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,889
must have explored all this before okay
so I I ran across the line there I

364
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899
so I I ran across the line there I
 

365
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,480
so I I ran across the line there I
wanted to see if Mesa would show up on

366
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,490
wanted to see if Mesa would show up on
 

367
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,579
wanted to see if Mesa would show up on
the other side here and nope we got

368
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:55,589
the other side here and nope we got
 

369
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,290
the other side here and nope we got
jungle huge huge jungle walls but this

370
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,300
jungle huge huge jungle walls but this
 

371
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,260
jungle huge huge jungle walls but this
is quite a ways out so we're at like x0

372
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,270
is quite a ways out so we're at like x0
 

373
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,590
is quite a ways out so we're at like x0
the generation the old generation went

374
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
the generation the old generation went
 

375
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,090
the generation the old generation went
for quite a ways actually so too bad

376
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
for quite a ways actually so too bad
 

377
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,210
for quite a ways actually so too bad
jungle biomes look pretty crazy we might

378
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,220
jungle biomes look pretty crazy we might
 

379
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,130
jungle biomes look pretty crazy we might
hop up there and just check it out I

380
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,140
hop up there and just check it out I
 

381
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,150
hop up there and just check it out I
think I see yeah so melons and that can

382
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
think I see yeah so melons and that can
 

383
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,579
think I see yeah so melons and that can
spawn outside of the biome kind of like

384
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:22,589
spawn outside of the biome kind of like
 

385
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,769
spawn outside of the biome kind of like
I saw this the pine trees in the Mesa

386
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:24,779
I saw this the pine trees in the Mesa
 

387
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,710
I saw this the pine trees in the Mesa
there where they didn't belong so this

388
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
there where they didn't belong so this
 

389
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,530
there where they didn't belong so this
is what amplified jungle holy smokes

390
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:33,540
is what amplified jungle holy smokes
 

391
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,090
is what amplified jungle holy smokes
that terrain looks like I'm getting a

392
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,100
that terrain looks like I'm getting a
 

393
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,490
that terrain looks like I'm getting a
lot of lag in here for some reason see

394
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:37,500
lot of lag in here for some reason see
 

395
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,139
lot of lag in here for some reason see
there's a leaf blocks doing it like all

396
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:39,149
there's a leaf blocks doing it like all
 

397
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,889
there's a leaf blocks doing it like all
the leaf blocks or I also saw there's a

398
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:42,899
the leaf blocks or I also saw there's a
 

399
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,860
the leaf blocks or I also saw there's a
huge lava and fire starting so that

400
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:48,870
huge lava and fire starting so that
 

401
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,639
huge lava and fire starting so that
might be what's letting me to you uh-huh

402
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:52,649
might be what's letting me to you uh-huh
 

403
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:55,370
might be what's letting me to you uh-huh
pretty cool though I like it probably

404
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,380
pretty cool though I like it probably
 

405
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,840
pretty cool though I like it probably
won't build here if I'm getting this leg

406
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:56,850
won't build here if I'm getting this leg
 

407
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,939
won't build here if I'm getting this leg
though okay I got to show you guys this

408
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:01,949
though okay I got to show you guys this
 

409
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,550
though okay I got to show you guys this
area this is really neat I haven't seen

410
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
area this is really neat I haven't seen
 

411
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
area this is really neat I haven't seen
this kind of generation before it's a

412
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:07,770
this kind of generation before it's a
 

413
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,990
this kind of generation before it's a
Mesa biome

414
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,000
Mesa biome
 

415
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,480
Mesa biome
I the thing that caught my eye it was

416
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,490
I the thing that caught my eye it was
 

417
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,889
I the thing that caught my eye it was
the red Santa is gonna come down here

418
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
the red Santa is gonna come down here
 

419
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,559
the red Santa is gonna come down here
and harvest some but it's like in the

420
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:15,569
and harvest some but it's like in the
 

421
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,990
and harvest some but it's like in the
ocean too it's really cool there's all

422
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
ocean too it's really cool there's all
 

423
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,410
ocean too it's really cool there's all
these little Mesa islands around there's

424
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,420
these little Mesa islands around there's
 

425
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,079
these little Mesa islands around there's
like floating islands like lots of them

426
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,089
like floating islands like lots of them
 

427
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,960
like floating islands like lots of them
and you got a great view of all the

428
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:26,970
and you got a great view of all the
 

429
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,790
and you got a great view of all the
layers I don't think I want to risk this

430
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
layers I don't think I want to risk this
 

431
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,040
layers I don't think I want to risk this
area I I'm hooking up the portals to the

432
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,050
area I I'm hooking up the portals to the
 

433
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,269
area I I'm hooking up the portals to the
Mesa area and by the way that's why I

434
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
Mesa area and by the way that's why I
 

435
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,160
Mesa area and by the way that's why I
came back here yeah this is a very cool

436
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,170
came back here yeah this is a very cool
 

437
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,960
came back here yeah this is a very cool
area because usually Mesa biomes it's

438
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:44,970
area because usually Mesa biomes it's
 

439
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,540
area because usually Mesa biomes it's
just like it's all dry there's no water

440
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:47,550
just like it's all dry there's no water
 

441
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,059
just like it's all dry there's no water
around so the fact this one's in the

442
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:50,069
around so the fact this one's in the
 

443
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:58,309
around so the fact this one's in the
ocean kind of really neat oh that view

444
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:58,319
ocean kind of really neat oh that view
 

445
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,199
ocean kind of really neat oh that view
that view such delightful scenery arch

446
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,209
that view such delightful scenery arch
 

447
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,590
that view such delightful scenery arch
number one arch number two arch number

448
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:06,600
number one arch number two arch number
 

449
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,900
number one arch number two arch number
oh no it's not complete that's almost

450
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:08,910
oh no it's not complete that's almost
 

451
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,509
oh no it's not complete that's almost
arch number three over there hey just

452
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
arch number three over there hey just
 

453
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,299
arch number three over there hey just
about look at the Mesa plateau plateau F

454
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:17,309
about look at the Mesa plateau plateau F
 

455
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,090
about look at the Mesa plateau plateau F
yeah check this out it goes on for quite

456
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,100
yeah check this out it goes on for quite
 

457
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,040
yeah check this out it goes on for quite
a ways and it looks really cool I like

458
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,050
a ways and it looks really cool I like
 

459
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,780
a ways and it looks really cool I like
it I think I like it more than the Mesa

460
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:23,790
it I think I like it more than the Mesa
 

461
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,790
it I think I like it more than the Mesa
I advised to build because it actually

462
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:25,800
I advised to build because it actually
 

463
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,319
I advised to build because it actually
has hey guy it's got the the dirt and

464
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:30,329
has hey guy it's got the the dirt and
 

465
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,749
has hey guy it's got the the dirt and
the trees and there's also clay in the

466
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:32,759
the trees and there's also clay in the
 

467
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,519
the trees and there's also clay in the
side of the hills I think it looks

468
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:34,529
side of the hills I think it looks
 

469
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,009
side of the hills I think it looks
pretty good actually I like it so many

470
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,019
pretty good actually I like it so many
 

471
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,679
pretty good actually I like it so many
of these guys all over the place there's

472
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:45,689
of these guys all over the place there's
 

473
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,199
of these guys all over the place there's
really just the incredible amount of

474
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:48,209
really just the incredible amount of
 

475
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,410
really just the incredible amount of
cool things to see I love exploring it's

476
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:51,420
cool things to see I love exploring it's
 

477
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,829
cool things to see I love exploring it's
so much fun so this stuff here this is

478
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,839
so much fun so this stuff here this is
 

479
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,639
so much fun so this stuff here this is
right next to that Mesa plateau F that

480
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:58,649
right next to that Mesa plateau F that
 

481
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:01,910
right next to that Mesa plateau F that
stuff this is just Mesa plateau and it

482
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
stuff this is just Mesa plateau and it
 

483
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
stuff this is just Mesa plateau and it
looks like it generates the same way

484
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:03,930
looks like it generates the same way
 

485
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,799
looks like it generates the same way
that stuff does except instead of soil

486
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:06,809
that stuff does except instead of soil
 

487
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,439
that stuff does except instead of soil
it and grass and stuff it puts just

488
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:09,449
it and grass and stuff it puts just
 

489
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,840
it and grass and stuff it puts just
orange clay on the top of everything you

490
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:11,850
orange clay on the top of everything you
 

491
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,160
orange clay on the top of everything you
see how everything has the orange clay

492
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,170
see how everything has the orange clay
 

493
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,009
see how everything has the orange clay
on top and then there's no trees either

494
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:16,019
on top and then there's no trees either
 

495
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,629
on top and then there's no trees either
obviously then we got more of the F

496
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
obviously then we got more of the F
 

497
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,740
obviously then we got more of the F
stuff over here

498
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:21,750
stuff over here
 

499
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,370
stuff over here
there's

500
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:22,380
there's
 

501
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,030
there's
also a Bryce cannons type of generation

502
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
also a Bryce cannons type of generation
 

503
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,060

for Mesa or sub terrain I guess it's

504
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,070
for Mesa or sub terrain I guess it's
 

505
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,920
for Mesa or sub terrain I guess it's
called sub sub biome but I haven't seen

506
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:33,930
called sub sub biome but I haven't seen
 

507
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,990
called sub sub biome but I haven't seen
that yet that's like the rarest biome I

508
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
that yet that's like the rarest biome I
 

509
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,830
that yet that's like the rarest biome I
think oh this is it I just like I

510
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:42,840
think oh this is it I just like I

Mesa biome I looked and I guess there's

558
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:56,500
Mesa biome I looked and I guess there's
 

559
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,670
Mesa biome I looked and I guess there's
two more mesas there's the mountain

560
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:58,680
two more mesas there's the mountain
 

561
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,870
two more mesas there's the mountain
varieties so there's Mesa plateau M or

562
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:03,880
varieties so there's Mesa plateau M or
 

563
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,440
varieties so there's Mesa plateau M or
mountain and there's Mesa plateau FM or

564
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,450
mountain and there's Mesa plateau FM or
 

565
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:15,329
mountain and there's Mesa plateau FM or
forested Mountain come on guy let's see

566
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:15,339
forested Mountain come on guy let's see

there was a really cool area where was

568
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:16,990
there was a really cool area where was
 

569
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,990
there was a really cool area where was
it I think it must be through here

570
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,000
it I think it must be through here
 

571
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,540
it I think it must be through here
creeper no it's like all these arches oh

572
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:24,550
creeper no it's like all these arches oh
 

573
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,570
creeper no it's like all these arches oh
no no all these arches and it's just a

really cool area I think this is it yeah
 

577
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,300
really cool area I think this is it yeah
so up this way with some more of that

578
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,310
so up this way with some more of that
 

579
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,660
so up this way with some more of that
Bryce stuff I think yeah this is it

580
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:39,670
Bryce stuff I think yeah this is it
 

581
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,269
Bryce stuff I think yeah this is it
Bryce I think what Bryce does is it has

582
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:42,279
Bryce I think what Bryce does is it has
 

583
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,910
Bryce I think what Bryce does is it has
a lot of this kind of stuff for me and

584
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:44,920
a lot of this kind of stuff for me and
 

585
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,670
a lot of this kind of stuff for me and
it's maybe and like that but I don't

586
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:50,680
it's maybe and like that but I don't
 

587
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,650
it's maybe and like that but I don't
think I have enough of the biome to

588
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:52,660
think I have enough of the biome to
 

589
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,780
think I have enough of the biome to
really see what it does exactly this is

590
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:54,790
really see what it does exactly this is
 

591
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,650
really see what it does exactly this is
really weird it like cuts off there I

592
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:57,660
really weird it like cuts off there I
 

593
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,130
really weird it like cuts off there I
think it's floating but I haven't

594
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,140
think it's floating but I haven't
 

595
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,840
think it's floating but I haven't
figured out exactly what's different in

596
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:03,850
figured out exactly what's different in
 

597
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:09,000
figured out exactly what's different in
the Bryce um yeah I love all these walls

598
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,010
the Bryce um yeah I love all these walls
 

599
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,900
the Bryce um yeah I love all these walls
and little caves out this way let's just

600
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,910
and little caves out this way let's just
 

601
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,070
and little caves out this way let's just
look at this - I like this area a lot

602
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,080
look at this - I like this area a lot
 

603
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,400
look at this - I like this area a lot
because it gets really flat

604
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,410
because it gets really flat
 

605
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,870
because it gets really flat
you got the walls and the caves all

606
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:21,880
you got the walls and the caves all
 

607
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,269
you got the walls and the caves all
around us and then over here it's some

608
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:24,279
around us and then over here it's some
 

609
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,800
around us and then over here it's some
more of that forested area and it's

610
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:25,810
more of that forested area and it's
 

611
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,040
more of that forested area and it's
really really flat around here actually

612
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,050

 

613
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,579

that's pretty cool pretty cool

614
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:35,589
that's pretty cool pretty cool
 

615
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,540
that's pretty cool pretty cool
nice nice area alright but anyway we've

616
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,550
nice nice area alright but anyway we've
 

617
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,850
nice nice area alright but anyway we've
seen enough of Mesa I think unless I see

618
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:42,860
seen enough of Mesa I think unless I see
 

619
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,239
seen enough of Mesa I think unless I see
another really cool thing next clip is

620
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:46,249
another really cool thing next clip is
 

621
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,280
another really cool thing next clip is
probably gonna be from when I find a

622
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,290
probably gonna be from when I find a
 

623
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,129
probably gonna be from when I find a
roofed forest if I if I do find one oh I

624
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:54,139
roofed forest if I if I do find one oh I
 

625
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,769
roofed forest if I if I do find one oh I
just found a very nice Plains biome here

626
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:56,779
just found a very nice Plains biome here
 

627
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,519

up above cloud level looks like it goes

628
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:00,529
up above cloud level looks like it goes
 

629
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,059
up above cloud level looks like it goes
a little bit higher yet that's what I

630

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:03,910
shadow there and it's like okay looked
 

789
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,870
shadow there and it's like okay looked
up waited for a bit nothing nothing and

790
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
up waited for a bit nothing nothing and
 

791
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,860
up waited for a bit nothing nothing and
then finally a giant giant island all on

792
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:10,870
then finally a giant giant island all on
 

793
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:18,120
then finally a giant giant island all on
its own there very cool there's even a

794
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,130
its own there very cool there's even a
 

795
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,460
its own there very cool there's even a
tree that's just like on a single dirt

796
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,470
tree that's just like on a single dirt
 

797
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,800
tree that's just like on a single dirt
block way out let's see if we can see it

798
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:22,810
block way out let's see if we can see it
 

799
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,620
block way out let's see if we can see it
from down here yeah look at that that

800
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:25,630
from down here yeah look at that that
 

801
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,540
from down here yeah look at that that
tree over there

802
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:26,550
tree over there
 

803
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,670
tree over there
it's like floating it's awesome

804
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:31,680

 

805
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680

but I've done a lot of exploring I think

806
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:34,690
but I've done a lot of exploring I think
 

807
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,210
but I've done a lot of exploring I think
I've explored everything out this

808
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:36,220
I've explored everything out this
 

809
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,010
I've explored everything out this
direction I've hit the ocean on all

810
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,020
direction I've hit the ocean on all
 

811
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,640
direction I've hit the ocean on all
three sides it's like a peninsula goes

812
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,650
three sides it's like a peninsula goes
 

813
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,730
three sides it's like a peninsula goes
to about negative 6000 before the ocean

814
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:44,740
to about negative 6000 before the ocean
 

815
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:51,210
to about negative 6000 before the ocean
and no roof or snow spiky snow biome or

816
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,220
and no roof or snow spiky snow biome or
 

817
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,580
and no roof or snow spiky snow biome or
anything like that I think we'll have to

818
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:53,590
anything like that I think we'll have to
 

819
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,750
anything like that I think we'll have to
go a different direction

820
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:54,760
go a different direction
 

821
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,440
go a different direction
if we want to find that stuff so I'm

822
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,450
if we want to find that stuff so I'm
 

823
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,000
if we want to find that stuff so I'm
probably gonna head back in I'll just

824
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,010
probably gonna head back in I'll just
 

825
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,470
probably gonna head back in I'll just
have to look for that stuff some other

826
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:01,480
have to look for that stuff some other
 

827
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,490
have to look for that stuff some other
time too

828
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:02,500
time too
 

829
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,770

gonna try the nether and I haven't been
 

913
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,280
gonna try the nether and I haven't been
able to check what's on the other side

914
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,290
able to check what's on the other side
 

915
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,760
able to check what's on the other side
of this yet so hopefully he survives I

916
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:54,770
of this yet so hopefully he survives I
 

917
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,290

I wanted to be in this tunnel maybe
 

929
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,810
I wanted to be in this tunnel maybe
let's expand this a little bit yeah you

930
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:21,820
let's expand this a little bit yeah you
 

931
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,750
let's expand this a little bit yeah you
go forward perfect so I think you'll be

932
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
go forward perfect so I think you'll be
 

933
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,830
go forward perfect so I think you'll be
fine here I just gonna make this wider

934
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840

 

935
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,700

alright let's see if we can get him back

936
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:35,710
alright let's see if we can get him back
 

937
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,830
alright let's see if we can get him back
now I brought a secret weapon that

938
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
now I brought a secret weapon that
 

939
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,160
now I brought a secret weapon that
worked on him and here we go

940
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,170
worked on him and here we go
 

941
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,200
worked on him and here we go
still only one wide in a lot of places

942
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,210
still only one wide in a lot of places
 

943
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,610
still only one wide in a lot of places
and this fall probably killed I think

944
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:50,620
and this fall probably killed I think
 

945
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,750
