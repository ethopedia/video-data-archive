00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640

 

29
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,310

i really like this farm uh right now the

30
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
i really like this farm uh right now the
 

31
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,830
i really like this farm uh right now the
only thing working

32
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
only thing working
 

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,430
only thing working
or the only way it's working is with

34
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
or the only way it's working is with
 

35
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,110
or the only way it's working is with
manual reset we have to hit the button

36
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
manual reset we have to hit the button
 

37
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,950
manual reset we have to hit the button
every time we shear sheep

38
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
every time we shear sheep
 

39
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,790
every time we shear sheep
we want to hook up the automatic system

40
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
we want to hook up the automatic system
 

41
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,150
we want to hook up the automatic system
using the water

42
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
using the water
 

43
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,750
using the water
today if possible i was going to wait

44
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
today if possible i was going to wait
 

45
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,150
today if possible i was going to wait
for

46
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
for
 

47
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,270
for
the dispenser thing in 1.3

48
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
the dispenser thing in 1.3
 

49
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,110
the dispenser thing in 1.3
where you can shoot and pick up water

50
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
where you can shoot and pick up water
 

51
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,670
where you can shoot and pick up water
from dispensers

52
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
from dispensers
 

53
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,910
from dispensers
but somebody pointed out that

54
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
but somebody pointed out that
 

55
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,070
but somebody pointed out that
you would have to have this open like

56
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
you would have to have this open like
 

57
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,590
you would have to have this open like
it wouldn't look very good because you

58
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
it wouldn't look very good because you
 

59
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,590
it wouldn't look very good because you
wouldn't have a flush roof or flush

60
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
wouldn't have a flush roof or flush
 

61
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,789
wouldn't have a flush roof or flush
ceiling

62
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
ceiling
 

63
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,310
ceiling
so we're going to do it the old

64
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
so we're going to do it the old
 

65
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,469
so we're going to do it the old
old-fashioned current way

66
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
old-fashioned current way
 

67
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,990
old-fashioned current way
of using pistons to to let water

68
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
of using pistons to to let water
 

69
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,630
of using pistons to to let water
down instead of using dispensers it'll

70
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
down instead of using dispensers it'll
 

71
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,550
down instead of using dispensers it'll
it'll look better

72
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
it'll look better
 

73
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,670
it'll look better
and yeah i'll show you the wiring

74
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680

 

75
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,109

this is what i hooked up at the end of

76
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
this is what i hooked up at the end of
 

77
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,429
this is what i hooked up at the end of
the last episode i went to all these

78
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
the last episode i went to all these
 

79
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,870
the last episode i went to all these
and ran this wire here which goes down

80
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
and ran this wire here which goes down
 

81
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,749
and ran this wire here which goes down
to this torch and this controls the

82
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
to this torch and this controls the
 

83
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,830
to this torch and this controls the
reset

84
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
reset
 

85
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,350
reset
on these things that's the reset torch

86
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
on these things that's the reset torch
 

87
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,749
on these things that's the reset torch
right there um

88
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
right there um
 

89
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,670
right there um
yeah so it's pretty much all wired we

90
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
yeah so it's pretty much all wired we
 

91
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,429
yeah so it's pretty much all wired we
just need to do the water system

92
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439

 

93
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,190

and uh what else was i gonna say

94
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
and uh what else was i gonna say
 

95
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,870
and uh what else was i gonna say
oh yeah big confusion a lot of people

96
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
oh yeah big confusion a lot of people
 

97
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,790
oh yeah big confusion a lot of people
had was why i chose to use pistons here

98
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
had was why i chose to use pistons here
 

99
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,750
had was why i chose to use pistons here
you can use glass you can use half slabs

100
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
you can use glass you can use half slabs
 

101
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,430
you can use glass you can use half slabs
upside down half slabs

102
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
upside down half slabs
 

103
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,030
upside down half slabs
if you used upside down half slabs you

104
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
if you used upside down half slabs you
 

105
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,990
if you used upside down half slabs you
could even make the floor completely

106
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
could even make the floor completely
 

107
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,670
could even make the floor completely
seamless like no no different textures

108
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
seamless like no no different textures
 

109
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,229
seamless like no no different textures
here

110
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
here
 

111
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,470
here
but i chose to use pistons because i

112
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
but i chose to use pistons because i
 

113
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,750
but i chose to use pistons because i
like that

114
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
like that
 

115
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,830
like that
the texture to it kind of breaks up the

116
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
the texture to it kind of breaks up the
 

117
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,350
the texture to it kind of breaks up the
room a little bit

118
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
room a little bit
 

119
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,110
room a little bit
compared to using stone bricks for

120
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
compared to using stone bricks for
 

121
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,830
compared to using stone bricks for
everything

122
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
everything
 

123
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,270
everything
um yeah but even if you guys use

124
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
um yeah but even if you guys use
 

125
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,229
um yeah but even if you guys use
glass or whatever on this you still have

126
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
glass or whatever on this you still have
 

127
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:42,790
glass or whatever on this you still have
to push

128
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
to push
 

129
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,070
to push
the block down with the piston because

130
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
the block down with the piston because
 

131
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,350
the block down with the piston because
you can't place it

132
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
you can't place it
 

133
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,309
you can't place it
with the sheep there it doesn't let you

134
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
with the sheep there it doesn't let you
 

135
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,589
with the sheep there it doesn't let you
so

136
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599

 

137
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,110

just choose whichever one you like the

138
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
just choose whichever one you like the
 

139
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,949
just choose whichever one you like the
most i like the piston the most the look

140
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
most i like the piston the most the look
 

141
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,470
most i like the piston the most the look
of it

142
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
of it
 

143
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,030
of it
but you'll still have to push him down

144
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
but you'll still have to push him down
 

145
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,110
but you'll still have to push him down
the way i did there

146
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
the way i did there
 

147
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,110
the way i did there
um what was i going to say

148
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
um what was i going to say
 

149
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,149
um what was i going to say
losing my train of thought here if you

150
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
losing my train of thought here if you
 

151
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,110
losing my train of thought here if you
could like if you could use a lamp there

152
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
could like if you could use a lamp there
 

153
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,750
could like if you could use a lamp there
it would have been

154
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
it would have been
 

155
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,630
it would have been
awesome because the way this is wired

156
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640

 

157
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,229

repeater goes to that block there if

158
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
repeater goes to that block there if
 

159
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,350
repeater goes to that block there if
there was a lamp above that it would

160
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
there was a lamp above that it would
 

161
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,070
there was a lamp above that it would
it would work like an indicator light

162
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
it would work like an indicator light
 

163
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,789
it would work like an indicator light
like i have

164
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
like i have
 

165
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,589
like i have
here except without all the the crazy

166
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
here except without all the the crazy
 

167
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,110
here except without all the the crazy
wiring back there would have been a lot

168
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
wiring back there would have been a lot
 

169
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,910
wiring back there would have been a lot
simpler

170
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
simpler
 

171
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,710
simpler
but you got to pick a block that won't

172
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
but you got to pick a block that won't
 

173
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,949
but you got to pick a block that won't
suffocate the mobs i've tried it out

174
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
suffocate the mobs i've tried it out
 

175
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,990
suffocate the mobs i've tried it out
and unfortunately

176
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
and unfortunately
 

177
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,190
and unfortunately
lamps do cause suffocation

178
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200

 

179
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,470

nice feel there i can't reach it

180
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
nice feel there i can't reach it
 

181
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,390
nice feel there i can't reach it
oh no i need an assistant

182
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
oh no i need an assistant
 

183
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:10,070
oh no i need an assistant
hmm how can i do this

184
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080

 

185
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,110

yeah you see it it damaged me

186
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
yeah you see it it damaged me
 

187
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,710
yeah you see it it damaged me
not the best demonstration but you get

188
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
not the best demonstration but you get
 

189
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,229
not the best demonstration but you get
the point you have to pick a block that

190
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
the point you have to pick a block that
 

191
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,749
the point you have to pick a block that
won't suffocate the sheep otherwise

192
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
won't suffocate the sheep otherwise
 

193
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,229
won't suffocate the sheep otherwise
you'll just

194
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
you'll just
 

195
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,749
you'll just
all die so you got pistons half slabs

196
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
all die so you got pistons half slabs
 

197
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,310
all die so you got pistons half slabs
um stairs i think you're okay you could

198
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
um stairs i think you're okay you could
 

199
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,590
um stairs i think you're okay you could
use

200
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
use
 

201
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,550
use
uh you know a bunch of different blocks

202
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
uh you know a bunch of different blocks
 

203
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,070
uh you know a bunch of different blocks
leaves is another one

204
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080

 

205
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,310

yeah but i chose pistons

206
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320

 

207
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,070

so to start off with today i think what

208
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
so to start off with today i think what
 

209
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,990
so to start off with today i think what
we'll do is just a little bit

210
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
we'll do is just a little bit
 

211
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,469
we'll do is just a little bit
of cleanup you can see quite a bit of

212
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
of cleanup you can see quite a bit of
 

213
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,909
of cleanup you can see quite a bit of
stuff if you look through these grates

214
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
stuff if you look through these grates
 

215
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,510
stuff if you look through these grates
there's not much we can do about that

216
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
there's not much we can do about that
 

217
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,510
there's not much we can do about that
but we can help it out a little bit

218
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
but we can help it out a little bit
 

219
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,030
but we can help it out a little bit
if we were safe to put some blocks here

220
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
if we were safe to put some blocks here
 

221
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,189
if we were safe to put some blocks here
and now should look a lot better

222
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
and now should look a lot better
 

223
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,790
and now should look a lot better
if we accidentally look through the the

224
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
if we accidentally look through the the
 

225
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,430
if we accidentally look through the the
grates you know

226
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
grates you know
 

227
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,670
grates you know
you know you have to be from back here

228
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
you know you have to be from back here
 

229
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,990
you know you have to be from back here
you it looks really good but if

230
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
you it looks really good but if
 

231
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,870
you it looks really good but if
you have to be way up close to see the

232
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
you have to be way up close to see the
 

233
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,629
you have to be way up close to see the
redstone and whatnot

234
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
redstone and whatnot
 

235
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,230
redstone and whatnot
so that helps i'm going to do that for

236
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
so that helps i'm going to do that for
 

237
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,390
so that helps i'm going to do that for
all of them and also

238
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
all of them and also
 

239
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,749
all of them and also
something i want to do is just

240
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
something i want to do is just
 

241
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,909
something i want to do is just
cover up this wiring i don't i don't

242
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
cover up this wiring i don't i don't
 

243
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,430
cover up this wiring i don't i don't
want to open like this just in case

244
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
want to open like this just in case
 

245
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,189
want to open like this just in case
water spills or whatever

246
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
water spills or whatever
 

247
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,110
water spills or whatever
so i'm going to put a block there and a

248
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
so i'm going to put a block there and a
 

249
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,590
so i'm going to put a block there and a
half slab here on all of them

250
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
half slab here on all of them
 

251
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,590
half slab here on all of them
and maybe something else i'll do is

252
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
and maybe something else i'll do is
 

253
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,430
and maybe something else i'll do is
put a half slab between these so i don't

254
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
put a half slab between these so i don't
 

255
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,270
put a half slab between these so i don't
have to jump as much if i'm walking over

256
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
have to jump as much if i'm walking over
 

257
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,629
have to jump as much if i'm walking over
here

258
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639

 

259
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,310

yeah that helps a bit it's a little a

260
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
yeah that helps a bit it's a little a
 

261
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,870
yeah that helps a bit it's a little a
little bit easier to walk around now

262
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
little bit easier to walk around now
 

263
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,990
little bit easier to walk around now
i don't know if i ever showed this thing

264
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
i don't know if i ever showed this thing
 

265
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,029
i don't know if i ever showed this thing
working from down below here

266
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
working from down below here
 

267
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,469
working from down below here
you saw the grass grew and hurt the

268
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
you saw the grass grew and hurt the
 

269
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,070
you saw the grass grew and hurt the
piston

270
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
piston
 

271
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,189
piston
pretty soon he'll eat it and pop up

272
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
pretty soon he'll eat it and pop up
 

273
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,550
pretty soon he'll eat it and pop up
my inventory might look a little

274
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
my inventory might look a little
 

275
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,469
my inventory might look a little
different i

276
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
different i
 

277
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,150
different i
made a little bit of a mistake when i

278
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
made a little bit of a mistake when i
 

279
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,590
made a little bit of a mistake when i
was recording a clip

280
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
was recording a clip
 

281
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,870
was recording a clip
i tried to show the water system by

282
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
i tried to show the water system by
 

283
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,390
i tried to show the water system by
by manually placing the water down and i

284
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
by manually placing the water down and i
 

285
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,070
by manually placing the water down and i
left it down for too long a bunch of

286
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
left it down for too long a bunch of
 

287
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,749
left it down for too long a bunch of
sheep died

288
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
sheep died
 

289
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,909
sheep died
so i decided to load back up instead of

290
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919

 

291
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,990

replacing the sheep a little quicker

292
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
replacing the sheep a little quicker
 

293
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,749
replacing the sheep a little quicker
this way so i had to redo a few things

294
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
this way so i had to redo a few things
 

295
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,390
this way so i had to redo a few things
here

296
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
here
 

297
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,510
here
but we seem to be where we left off

298
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520

 

299
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,870

because i backed up the world just

300
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
because i backed up the world just
 

301
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,309
because i backed up the world just
before i started recording

302
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

303
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,189

all right so i was looking at the wiring

304
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
all right so i was looking at the wiring
 

305
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,870
all right so i was looking at the wiring
here and it looks like i could

306
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
here and it looks like i could
 

307
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,469
here and it looks like i could
pretty easily put in a master reset too

308
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
pretty easily put in a master reset too
 

309
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,070
pretty easily put in a master reset too
uh if i if i run

310
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080

 

311
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,749

this is the wire i need to connect to if

312
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
this is the wire i need to connect to if
 

313
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,469
this is the wire i need to connect to if
i ran

314
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479

 

315
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,950

like repeaters going this way on both

316
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
like repeaters going this way on both
 

317
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,589
like repeaters going this way on both
sides

318
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
sides
 

319
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,070
sides
i could easily have a manual reset

320
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
i could easily have a manual reset
 

321
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,990
i could easily have a manual reset
for for all of them and then also i can

322
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
for for all of them and then also i can
 

323
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,390
for for all of them and then also i can
have the water reset thing

324
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
have the water reset thing
 

325
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,950
have the water reset thing
so i might do that

326
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960

 

327
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,629

you know what on second thought that

328
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
you know what on second thought that
 

329
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,029
you know what on second thought that
won't work because

330
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
won't work because
 

331
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,189
won't work because
i can't have the master wire connected

332
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
i can't have the master wire connected
 

333
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,270
i can't have the master wire connected
to these individual wires

334
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
to these individual wires
 

335
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,790
to these individual wires
otherwise like if i had it going here

336
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
otherwise like if i had it going here
 

337
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,790
otherwise like if i had it going here
and i pressed the button for this one it

338
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
and i pressed the button for this one it
 

339
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,029
and i pressed the button for this one it
would reset everything

340
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
would reset everything
 

341
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,629
would reset everything
down the line that it that it's

342
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
down the line that it that it's
 

343
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,070
down the line that it that it's
connected to so

344
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080

 

345
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,510

i'm gonna i'm still gonna do it but i'm

346
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
i'm gonna i'm still gonna do it but i'm
 

347
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,430
i'm gonna i'm still gonna do it but i'm
gonna do it over here and keep it

348
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
gonna do it over here and keep it
 

349
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,469
gonna do it over here and keep it
separate so it'll go something like

350
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
separate so it'll go something like
 

351
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,589
separate so it'll go something like
uh

352
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599

 

353
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,830

like that so this wire doesn't connect

354
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
like that so this wire doesn't connect
 

355
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,589
like that so this wire doesn't connect
to the master wire at all but the master

356
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
to the master wire at all but the master
 

357
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,110
to the master wire at all but the master
wire can power it

358
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120

 

359
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,390

and then here i'll probably do

360
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400

 

361
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,430

peter here here and here

362
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
peter here here and here
 

363
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,629
peter here here and here
block there and there

364
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639

 

365
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,309

that'll work it's a little bit expensive

366
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
that'll work it's a little bit expensive
 

367
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,670
that'll work it's a little bit expensive
but whatever

368
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
but whatever
 

369
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,950
but whatever
we can get more redstone

370
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
we can get more redstone
 

371
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,909
we can get more redstone
um so a lot of you know i've been

372
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
um so a lot of you know i've been
 

373

um so a lot of you know i've been
complaining a little bit about my mouse

374
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599

375
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,830
complaining a little bit about my mouse
recently it's been giving me trouble

376
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
recently it's been giving me trouble
 

377
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,589
recently it's been giving me trouble
a lot of the times when i would single

378
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
a lot of the times when i would single
 

379
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,950
a lot of the times when i would single
click it would double click

380
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
click it would double click
 

381
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,390
click it would double click
or a big problem i was having is when i

382
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
or a big problem i was having is when i
 

383
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,150
or a big problem i was having is when i
would try to drag a file around or

384
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
would try to drag a file around or
 

385
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,629
would try to drag a file around or
something

386
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
something
 

387
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,270
something
it would sometimes just randomly let go

388
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
it would sometimes just randomly let go
 

389
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,309
it would sometimes just randomly let go
of it

390
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
of it
 

391
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,950
of it
and drop it in in folders and i'd have

392
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
and drop it in in folders and i'd have
 

393
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,070
and drop it in in folders and i'd have
no idea where it would go

394
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
no idea where it would go
 

395
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,269
no idea where it would go
and oh it's just causing me

396
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
and oh it's just causing me
 

397
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,550
and oh it's just causing me
a lot of angry feelings

398
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
a lot of angry feelings
 

399
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,310
a lot of angry feelings

pretty bad to the point where i either
 

403
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,470
pretty bad to the point where i either
had to get a new mouse or fix it

404
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
had to get a new mouse or fix it
 

405

and you guys have been suggesting that i

408
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
should clean it out
 

409
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,030

expecting to see a big layer of of grime
 

419
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,750
expecting to see a big layer of of grime
under the button like

420
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760

underneath uh blocking the button
 

425
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,590
underneath uh blocking the button
somehow

426
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
somehow
 

427
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,710
somehow
but uh it looked pretty much

428
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
but uh it looked pretty much
 

429
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,990
but uh it looked pretty much

up
 

441
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,470
up
i wasn't expecting it to i fixed

442
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
i wasn't expecting it to i fixed
 

443
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,030
i wasn't expecting it to i fixed
anything

444
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
anything
 

445
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,150
anything
but yeah it's like all better now

446
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
but yeah it's like all better now
 

447
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,430
but yeah it's like all better now
so thanks for the suggestion i don't

448
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
so thanks for the suggestion i don't
 

449
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,670
so thanks for the suggestion i don't
know

450
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680

 

451
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,990

i guess it's just it just must really be

452
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
i guess it's just it just must really be
 

453
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,509
i guess it's just it just must really be
sensitive to dust or something because

454
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
sensitive to dust or something because
 

455
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,389
sensitive to dust or something because
there wasn't much

456
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
there wasn't much
 

457
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,269
there wasn't much
but it's working just fine now or seems

458
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
but it's working just fine now or seems
 

459
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,550
but it's working just fine now or seems
to be

460
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560

 

461
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,470

okay so i ran the master wire on both

462
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
okay so i ran the master wire on both
 

463
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,910
okay so i ran the master wire on both
sides now it's

464
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
sides now it's
 

465
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,949
sides now it's
it's all set up for a test run uh

466
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
it's all set up for a test run uh
 

467
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,630
it's all set up for a test run uh
you would only use that if you had all

468
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
you would only use that if you had all
 

469
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,150
you would only use that if you had all
these sheep up and you had them all

470
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
these sheep up and you had them all
 

471
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,590
these sheep up and you had them all
sheared

472
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
sheared
 

473
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,990
sheared
or that would be the ideal way of using

474
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
or that would be the ideal way of using
 

475
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,630
or that would be the ideal way of using
it

476
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
it
 

477
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,470
it
i still plan on using the automatic

478
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
i still plan on using the automatic
 

479
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,949
i still plan on using the automatic
system

480
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
system
 

481
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,990
system
pretty much all the time but

482
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
pretty much all the time but
 

483
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,990
pretty much all the time but
it's good to have more options always

484
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
it's good to have more options always
 

485
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,389
it's good to have more options always
so i just for right now i have a lever

486
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
so i just for right now i have a lever
 

487
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,750
so i just for right now i have a lever
in the middle there

488
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
in the middle there
 

489
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,870
in the middle there
to control it when i build the front of

490
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
to control it when i build the front of
 

491
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,550
to control it when i build the front of
the farm i'll probably

492
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
the farm i'll probably
 

493
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,069
the farm i'll probably
have two buttons one for the the master

494
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
have two buttons one for the the master
 

495
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,630
have two buttons one for the the master
reset

496
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
reset
 

497
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,590
reset
the manual one and one for the automatic

498
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
the manual one and one for the automatic
 

499
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,110
the manual one and one for the automatic
system

500
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120

 

501
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,470

okay let's try this out let's see how

502
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
okay let's try this out let's see how
 

503
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,310
okay let's try this out let's see how
much it lags the game and

504
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
much it lags the game and
 

505
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,670
much it lags the game and
if it's uniform or what

506
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680

 

507
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,150

that wasn't that bad i don't i don't

508
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
that wasn't that bad i don't i don't
 

509
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,750
that wasn't that bad i don't i don't
think my frames per second dropped all

510
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
think my frames per second dropped all
 

511
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,030
think my frames per second dropped all
that much

512
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
that much
 

513
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,590
that much
i was expecting worse

514
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
i was expecting worse
 

515
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,110
i was expecting worse
you know what they actually regrow their

516
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
you know what they actually regrow their
 

517
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,110
you know what they actually regrow their
wall really really fast

518
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
wall really really fast
 

519
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,310
wall really really fast
i i'm impressed

520
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
i i'm impressed
 

521
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,470
i i'm impressed
uh before we can continue on here we'll

522
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
uh before we can continue on here we'll
 

523
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
uh before we can continue on here we'll
have to take a little detour

524
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
have to take a little detour
 

525
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,310
have to take a little detour
and go to the end because i'm on my last

526
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
and go to the end because i'm on my last
 

527
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,630
and go to the end because i'm on my last
pick and it's almost dead

528
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
pick and it's almost dead
 

529
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,829
pick and it's almost dead
for the water system we'll have to clear

530
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
for the water system we'll have to clear
 

531
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,710
for the water system we'll have to clear
out a bit more land in the middle here

532
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
out a bit more land in the middle here
 

533
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,829
out a bit more land in the middle here
go up a bit more so we need some new

534
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
go up a bit more so we need some new
 

535
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,269
go up a bit more so we need some new
picks

536
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
picks
 

537
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,590
picks
i'll probably try stockpile a few picks

538
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
i'll probably try stockpile a few picks
 

539
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,069
i'll probably try stockpile a few picks
here first one up is a 43.

540
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079

 

541
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,670

oh man yes

542
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
oh man yes
 

543
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,470
oh man yes
and i broke the efficiency for streak

544
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
and i broke the efficiency for streak
 

545
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,310
and i broke the efficiency for streak
awesome

546
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320

 

547
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,629

uh next up is a shovel i've been without

548
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
uh next up is a shovel i've been without
 

549
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,150
uh next up is a shovel i've been without
a good shovel for a while now i've been

550
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
a good shovel for a while now i've been
 

551
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,790
a good shovel for a while now i've been
using

552
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
using
 

553
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,990
using
this thing let's hope for the best here

554
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000

 

555
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,190

oh

556
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200

 

557
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,509

okay that was unexpected i'll probably

558
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
okay that was unexpected i'll probably
 

559
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,110
okay that was unexpected i'll probably
have to enchant another one because i

560
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
have to enchant another one because i
 

561
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,710
have to enchant another one because i
want efficiency

562
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
want efficiency
 

563
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,710
want efficiency
but that isn't necessarily bad either

564
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720

 

565
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,110

let's go again here so we're doing 43

566
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
let's go again here so we're doing 43
 

567
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,990
let's go again here so we're doing 43
this time

568
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000

 

569
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,790

that's what i wanted that's exactly what

570
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
that's what i wanted that's exactly what
 

571
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,790
that's what i wanted that's exactly what
i wanted i never get unbreaking

572
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
i wanted i never get unbreaking
 

573
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,790
i wanted i never get unbreaking
and efficiency together on a shovel so i

574
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
and efficiency together on a shovel so i
 

575
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,910
and efficiency together on a shovel so i
finally

576
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
finally
 

577
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,750
finally
finally got a good one

578
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760

 

579
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,670

we are not done yet we're having an

580
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
we are not done yet we're having an
 

581
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,110
we are not done yet we're having an
enchantment frenzy today

582
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120

 

583
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,710

oh does not get much worse than that

584
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720

 

585
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,389

uh we'll make this one the last one for

586
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
uh we'll make this one the last one for
 

587
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,389
uh we'll make this one the last one for
the day let's hope it's a good one

588
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
the day let's hope it's a good one
 

589
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,590
the day let's hope it's a good one
leave on high notes

590
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600

 

591
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,509

it's it's good it's good i'm happy with

592
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
it's it's good it's good i'm happy with
 

593
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,710
it's it's good it's good i'm happy with
that

594
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720

 

595
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,550

oh boy well i got some sad news for you

596
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
oh boy well i got some sad news for you
 

597
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,829
oh boy well i got some sad news for you
guys

598
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839

 

599
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,470

um

600
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
um
 

601
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,710
um
hmm

602
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720

 

603
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,350

it's all gone gonna have to get some

604
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
it's all gone gonna have to get some
 

605
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,710
it's all gone gonna have to get some
more

606
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
more
 

607
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,150
more
uh this is pretty much all i got left

608
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
uh this is pretty much all i got left
 

609
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,030
uh this is pretty much all i got left
i got some there and

610
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040

 

611
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,150

a little bit here and and that

612
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
a little bit here and and that
 

613
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,670
a little bit here and and that
so i don't know if it's gonna be enough

614
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
so i don't know if it's gonna be enough
 

615
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,750
so i don't know if it's gonna be enough
to do the water system

616
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
to do the water system
 

617
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,710
to do the water system
um it'll be close

618
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720

 

619
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:45,350

you'll get quite a bit from this i think

620
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360

 

621
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,189

uh the water system is actually pretty

622
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
uh the water system is actually pretty
 

623
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,030
uh the water system is actually pretty
complicated

624
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
complicated
 

625
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,150
complicated
at first i thought it was going to be

626
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
at first i thought it was going to be
 

627
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,790
at first i thought it was going to be
really simple but

628
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
really simple but
 

629
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,189
really simple but
in all honesty all honesty

630
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
in all honesty all honesty
 

631
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,750
in all honesty all honesty
it's like i'm confessing something uh

632
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
it's like i'm confessing something uh
 

633
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,150
it's like i'm confessing something uh
but the thing is

634
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
but the thing is
 

635
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,790
but the thing is
i want it to look flush with the ceiling

636
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
i want it to look flush with the ceiling
 

637
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,150
i want it to look flush with the ceiling
right

638
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
right
 

639
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,269
right
so you can't just have one piston

640
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
so you can't just have one piston
 

641
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,470
so you can't just have one piston
because

642
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
because
 

643
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,470
because
if the piston retracts it's still it's

644
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
if the piston retracts it's still it's
 

645
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,629
if the piston retracts it's still it's
going to be like one block above that

646
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
going to be like one block above that
 

647
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,990
going to be like one block above that
be quiet and water won't be able to flow

648
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
be quiet and water won't be able to flow
 

649
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,949
be quiet and water won't be able to flow
down

650
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
down
 

651
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,910
down
so you need like a double extender

652
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
so you need like a double extender
 

653
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,629
so you need like a double extender
really

654
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639

 

655
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,230

and it gets pretty complicated i figured

656
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
and it gets pretty complicated i figured
 

657
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,990
and it gets pretty complicated i figured
it out though i went to creative

658
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
it out though i went to creative
 

659
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,870
it out though i went to creative
and messed around with it a bit and came

660
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
and messed around with it a bit and came
 

661
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,550
and messed around with it a bit and came
up with the solution that's

662
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
up with the solution that's
 

663
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,310
up with the solution that's
that's pretty good i don't know it might

664
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
that's pretty good i don't know it might
 

665
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,030
that's pretty good i don't know it might
be possible to compact it a little bit

666
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
be possible to compact it a little bit
 

667
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,670
be possible to compact it a little bit
more

668
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
more
 

669
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,990
more
or make it better but i'm happy with it

670
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
or make it better but i'm happy with it
 

671
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,509
or make it better but i'm happy with it
so

672
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
so
 

673
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,710
so
how much do we have we

674
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
how much do we have we
 

675
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,230
how much do we have we
might just be able to make it work

676
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
might just be able to make it work
 

677
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,150
might just be able to make it work
i need more repeaters as a problem oh

678
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
i need more repeaters as a problem oh
 

679
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,870
i need more repeaters as a problem oh
you know what i could do

680
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
you know what i could do
 

681
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,629
you know what i could do
um people have been requesting a tour of

682
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
um people have been requesting a tour of
 

683
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,509
um people have been requesting a tour of
my place again

684
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
my place again
 

685
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,350
my place again
i might do that soon there's not a whole

686
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
i might do that soon there's not a whole
 

687
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,910
i might do that soon there's not a whole
lot to see really

688
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
lot to see really
 

689
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,030
lot to see really
yeah you just saw it pretty much

690
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
yeah you just saw it pretty much
 

691
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,110
yeah you just saw it pretty much
but maybe i'll i'll go around and

692
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
but maybe i'll i'll go around and
 

693
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,710
but maybe i'll i'll go around and
explain things because i get a lot of

694
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
explain things because i get a lot of
 

695
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,670
explain things because i get a lot of
new subscribers every day and i

696
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
new subscribers every day and i
 

697
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,790
new subscribers every day and i
sometimes

698
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800

 

699
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,189

uh i could be a little bit more clear

700
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
uh i could be a little bit more clear
 

701
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,949
uh i could be a little bit more clear
about what's going on around here i

702
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
about what's going on around here i
 

703
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,230
about what's going on around here i
guess

704
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
guess
 

705
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,990
guess
you can always watch older videos though

706
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
you can always watch older videos though
 

707
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,350
you can always watch older videos though
if you want

708
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
if you want
 

709
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,829
if you want
i'm not going to force you but

710
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839

 

711
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,829

i'm lost where am i where am i going

712
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
i'm lost where am i where am i going
 

713
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,069
i'm lost where am i where am i going
i think i want to go this way yeah

714
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
i think i want to go this way yeah
 

715
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,870
i think i want to go this way yeah
i still got that thing sitting there and

716
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
i still got that thing sitting there and
 

717
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,590
i still got that thing sitting there and
there's

718
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
there's
 

719
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,749
there's
loads of redstone in it and i could

720
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
loads of redstone in it and i could
 

721
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,430
loads of redstone in it and i could
probably tear that down

722
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
probably tear that down
 

723
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,990
probably tear that down
bear squirrel has taken this design and

724
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
bear squirrel has taken this design and
 

725
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,629
bear squirrel has taken this design and
improved it

726
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
improved it
 

727
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,509
improved it
and posted it on his channel so if i

728
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
and posted it on his channel so if i
 

729
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,030
and posted it on his channel so if i
need to rebuild it i'll probably just

730
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
need to rebuild it i'll probably just
 

731
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870
need to rebuild it i'll probably just
copy what he has there

732
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
copy what he has there
 

733
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,470
copy what he has there
with improvements and i don't need this

734
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
with improvements and i don't need this
 

735
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,910
with improvements and i don't need this
sitting here i don't need to copy it

736
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
sitting here i don't need to copy it
 

737
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,870
sitting here i don't need to copy it
from this

738
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
from this
 

739
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,150
from this
so may as well get we

740
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
so may as well get we
 

741
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,189
so may as well get we
get what we can out of it and clean up

742
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
get what we can out of it and clean up
 

743
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,550
get what we can out of it and clean up
the place a bit

744
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560

 

745
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,150

well we got a little bit out of that

746
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
well we got a little bit out of that
 

747
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,749
well we got a little bit out of that
anyway hopefully

748
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
anyway hopefully
 

749
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,269
anyway hopefully
it'll be enough um i'm extending this

750
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
it'll be enough um i'm extending this
 

751
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,790
it'll be enough um i'm extending this
building a little bit over here

752
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
building a little bit over here
 

753
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,949
building a little bit over here
just so that the water surrounded the

754
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
just so that the water surrounded the
 

755
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,430
just so that the water surrounded the
very first one

756
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
very first one
 

757
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,949
very first one
um don't know where we're going to put

758
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
um don't know where we're going to put
 

759
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,430
um don't know where we're going to put
the

760
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
the
 

761
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,670
the
front wall or whatever it might be over

762
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
front wall or whatever it might be over
 

763
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,110
front wall or whatever it might be over
here

764
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
here
 

765
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,990
here
but it'll be fairly open even even what

766
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
but it'll be fairly open even even what
 

767
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,749
but it'll be fairly open even even what
we do put there um

768
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
we do put there um
 

769
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,389
we do put there um
see we'll move this

770
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399

 

771
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:51,670

yeah we'll extend it out to there

772
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
yeah we'll extend it out to there
 

773
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,829
yeah we'll extend it out to there
uh the trouble

774
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839

 

775
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,389

with the water system is we need at

776
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
with the water system is we need at
 

777
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,629
with the water system is we need at
least two pistons for it

778
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
least two pistons for it
 

779
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,230
least two pistons for it
to move it out of the way and the other

780
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
to move it out of the way and the other
 

781
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,309
to move it out of the way and the other
big issue is

782
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
big issue is
 

783
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,150
big issue is
i don't want

784
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160

 

785
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,710

here i'll just put this down to show you

786
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
here i'll just put this down to show you
 

787
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,549
here i'll just put this down to show you
if we have the water sitting in just one

788
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
if we have the water sitting in just one
 

789
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,069
if we have the water sitting in just one
block

790
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
block
 

791
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,710
block
like on the wood there uh we'll be able

792
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
like on the wood there uh we'll be able
 

793
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,750
like on the wood there uh we'll be able
to see it

794
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
to see it
 

795
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,309
to see it
from down here even when the water shut

796
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
from down here even when the water shut
 

797
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,110
from down here even when the water shut
off it'll drip

798
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
off it'll drip
 

799
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,270
off it'll drip
through which i don't like so we need it

800
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
through which i don't like so we need it
 

801
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,430
through which i don't like so we need it
at least

802
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
at least
 

803
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,430
at least
one block off that wooden layer there

804
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
one block off that wooden layer there
 

805
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,470
one block off that wooden layer there
too

806
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
too
 

807
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,590
too
which makes it a lot more difficult

808
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
which makes it a lot more difficult
 

809
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,830
which makes it a lot more difficult
but i have figured out how i want to do

810
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
but i have figured out how i want to do
 

811
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,549
but i have figured out how i want to do
it

812
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559

 

813
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,669

let's see do i got pistons yes

814
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679

 

815
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,590

so i've i'm gonna be doing

816
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
so i've i'm gonna be doing
 

817
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,390
so i've i'm gonna be doing
a little bit of a cheat here it just so

818
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
a little bit of a cheat here it just so
 

819
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,909
a little bit of a cheat here it just so
happens since i made this

820
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
happens since i made this
 

821
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,789
happens since i made this
ceiling out of wooden planks if we use

822
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
ceiling out of wooden planks if we use
 

823
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,950
ceiling out of wooden planks if we use
pistons

824
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
pistons
 

825
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,310
pistons
they look very similar the regular

826
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
they look very similar the regular
 

827
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,390
they look very similar the regular
pistons so that's what i'm gonna do

828
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
pistons so that's what i'm gonna do
 

829
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,310
pistons so that's what i'm gonna do
and i don't mind if it looks a little

830
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
and i don't mind if it looks a little
 

831
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,070
and i don't mind if it looks a little
bit different it kind of helps to break

832
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
bit different it kind of helps to break
 

833
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,590
bit different it kind of helps to break
up the room a bit

834
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
up the room a bit
 

835
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,350
up the room a bit
instead of it being all all monotone

836
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
instead of it being all all monotone
 

837
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,510
instead of it being all all monotone
so that's what we'll do for one of the

838
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
so that's what we'll do for one of the
 

839
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,950
so that's what we'll do for one of the
pistons

840
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
pistons
 

841
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,990
pistons
and then so when it's

842
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
and then so when it's
 

843
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,510
and then so when it's
when it's down like that the water would

844
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
when it's down like that the water would
 

845
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,430
when it's down like that the water would
be shut off type thing

846
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
be shut off type thing
 

847
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,270
be shut off type thing
and then our second piston we'll put

848
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
and then our second piston we'll put
 

849
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,350
and then our second piston we'll put
over here that'll be a sticky piston

850
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
over here that'll be a sticky piston
 

851
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,110
over here that'll be a sticky piston
and let's see

852
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120

 

853
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,830

i might be able to show you this i i ran

854
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
i might be able to show you this i i ran
 

855
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,430
i might be able to show you this i i ran
the

856
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
the
 

857
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,230
the
stone brick here already for the wiring

858
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
stone brick here already for the wiring
 

859
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,110
stone brick here already for the wiring
i'll go

860
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
i'll go
 

861
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,870
i'll go
something like

862
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880

 

863
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,310

let's see this one gets pissed in there

864
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
let's see this one gets pissed in there
 

865
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,909
let's see this one gets pissed in there
and then

866
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919

 

867
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,230

um oh no that's not in the right spot

868
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240

 

869
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,950

that has to be one block higher over

870
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
that has to be one block higher over
 

871
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,150
that has to be one block higher over
there

872
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160

 

873
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,669

i ripped out the ladders now i have to

874
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
i ripped out the ladders now i have to
 

875
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,590
i ripped out the ladders now i have to
ender pearl up every time

876
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600

 

877
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,510

so it'll be like that then we'll have a

878
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
so it'll be like that then we'll have a
 

879
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,270
so it'll be like that then we'll have a
repeater

880
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
repeater
 

881
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,390
repeater
at the regular piston set it too

882
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
at the regular piston set it too
 

883
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,750
at the regular piston set it too
and we'll keep it powered

884
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
and we'll keep it powered
 

885
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,710
and we'll keep it powered
and then it goes to the torch like that

886
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
and then it goes to the torch like that
 

887
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,669
and then it goes to the torch like that
so

888
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
so
 

889
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,150
so
since the pistons extended it looks

890
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
since the pistons extended it looks
 

891
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,669
since the pistons extended it looks
looks like it's flush with the roof like

892
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
looks like it's flush with the roof like
 

893
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,470
looks like it's flush with the roof like
that

894
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
that
 

895
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,590
that
or with the ceiling

896
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600

 

897
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,110

if we hook up a button here i

898
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
if we hook up a button here i
 

899
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,830
if we hook up a button here i
might be able to demonstrate what

900
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
might be able to demonstrate what
 

901
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,150
might be able to demonstrate what
happens

902
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160

 

903
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,310

[Music]

904
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320

 

905
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,909

that's good right then if we were to

906
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
that's good right then if we were to
 

907
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,630
that's good right then if we were to
send power

908
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
send power
 

909
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,750
send power
just to

910
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
just to
 

911
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,110
just to
the sticky piston here

912
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
the sticky piston here
 

913
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,390
the sticky piston here
since this is being powered

914
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
since this is being powered
 

915
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,510
since this is being powered
i'll just cut our lights a bit

916
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520

 

917
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,070

this is what happens

918
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080

 

919
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,710

so it doesn't pull it back because it's

920
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
so it doesn't pull it back because it's
 

921
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,990
so it doesn't pull it back because it's
extended then

922
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
extended then
 

923
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,549
extended then
so it stays there kind of like a cork

924
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
so it stays there kind of like a cork
 

925
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,029
so it stays there kind of like a cork
in the hole um

926
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039

 

927
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,669

why did i come down here just gonna

928
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
why did i come down here just gonna
 

929
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:34,310
why did i come down here just gonna
ender pearl back up now

930
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
ender pearl back up now
 

931
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,310
ender pearl back up now
but that when you hit the button it

932
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
but that when you hit the button it
 

933
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,750
but that when you hit the button it
shuts the repeater off so

934
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
shuts the repeater off so
 

935
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,950
shuts the repeater off so
it retracts and can move again so

936
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
it retracts and can move again so
 

937
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,710
it retracts and can move again so
what we need to do is uh

938
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
what we need to do is uh
 

939
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,990
what we need to do is uh
make this go all the way down and then

940
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
make this go all the way down and then
 

941
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,029
make this go all the way down and then
i think loop back

942
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
i think loop back
 

943
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,230
i think loop back
and power just the sticky pistons

944
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240

 

945
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,149

yeah so that's what we're going to try

946
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
yeah so that's what we're going to try
 

947
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,950
yeah so that's what we're going to try
to do i'll run this wire down here

948
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
to do i'll run this wire down here
 

949
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,669
to do i'll run this wire down here
and hopefully i didn't figure anything

950
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
and hopefully i didn't figure anything
 

951
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,470
and hopefully i didn't figure anything
out wrong here

952
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
out wrong here
 

953
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,909
out wrong here
and we'll see how it goes

954
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919

 

955
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,070

okay i got this about half done now so

956
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
okay i got this about half done now so
 

957
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,669
okay i got this about half done now so
we'll try it out

958
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
we'll try it out
 

959
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,710
we'll try it out
there there's one two three

960
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
there there's one two three
 

961
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,990
there there's one two three
four repeaters to get all the way down

962
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
four repeaters to get all the way down
 

963
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,830
four repeaters to get all the way down
so that's four four ticks

964
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840

 

965
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,750

and let's see if this works see see if

966
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
and let's see if this works see see if
 

967
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,190
and let's see if this works see see if
it causes a leg or anything

968
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200

 

969
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,390

seems to be okay

970
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400

 

971
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,470

that's the first stage then we got it

972
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
that's the first stage then we got it
 

973
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,830
that's the first stage then we got it
what i'll do is i'll

974
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
what i'll do is i'll
 

975
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,669
what i'll do is i'll
i'll kind of make a u here i'm cheating

976
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
i'll kind of make a u here i'm cheating
 

977
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,029
i'll kind of make a u here i'm cheating
a bit make a u and make it come back

978
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
a bit make a u and make it come back
 

979
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,630
a bit make a u and make it come back
uh that is not the best way of doing it

980
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
uh that is not the best way of doing it
 

981
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,789
uh that is not the best way of doing it
what i should do is uh

982
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799

 

983
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,870

right here set up my delay and then have

984
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
right here set up my delay and then have
 

985
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,390
right here set up my delay and then have
it go this

986
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
it go this
 

987
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,390
it go this
this wire so that it goes this way

988
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
this wire so that it goes this way
 

989
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,110
this wire so that it goes this way
but instead i'm making it go back and

990
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
but instead i'm making it go back and
 

991
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,149
but instead i'm making it go back and
come back around

992
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
come back around
 

993
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,909
come back around
so that'll make

994
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
so that'll make
 

995
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,630
so that'll make
the water in the back stay out the

996
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
the water in the back stay out the
 

997
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,029
the water in the back stay out the
longer than the water

998
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
longer than the water
 

999
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,470
longer than the water
no it'll make the water in this front

1000
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
no it'll make the water in this front
 

1001
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,470
no it'll make the water in this front
stay down longer than the water at the

1002
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
stay down longer than the water at the
 

1003
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,549
stay down longer than the water at the
very back

1004
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
very back
 

1005
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,750
very back
so if it was too long it would drown the

1006
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
so if it was too long it would drown the
 

1007
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,510
so if it was too long it would drown the
sheep but i think we can get away with

1008
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
sheep but i think we can get away with
 

1009
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,750
sheep but i think we can get away with
it

1010
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:25,760
it
 

1011
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,190
it
because the farm's not very long

1012
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200

 

1013
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,070

okay so at the bottom of the u here is

1014
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
okay so at the bottom of the u here is
 

1015
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,029
okay so at the bottom of the u here is
where we're gonna put

1016
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
where we're gonna put
 

1017
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,310
where we're gonna put
the delay i don't know what to set it at

1018
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
the delay i don't know what to set it at
 

1019
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,070
the delay i don't know what to set it at
we'll have to play around with it a bit

1020
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
we'll have to play around with it a bit
 

1021
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,230
we'll have to play around with it a bit
to get it right but

1022
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
to get it right but
 

1023
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,909
to get it right but
it needs to be long enough that the wool

1024
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
it needs to be long enough that the wool
 

1025
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,350
it needs to be long enough that the wool
will wash into

1026
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
will wash into
 

1027
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,590
will wash into
the grating uh but if it's too long

1028
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
the grating uh but if it's too long
 

1029
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,230
the grating uh but if it's too long
it'll drown the sheep and i'll get

1030
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
it'll drown the sheep and i'll get
 

1031
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,029
it'll drown the sheep and i'll get
really mad

1032
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
really mad
 

1033
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,070
really mad
so we gotta find the sweet spot in

1034
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
so we gotta find the sweet spot in
 

1035
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,110
so we gotta find the sweet spot in
between

1036
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120

 

1037
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,190

so what we'll do we have to invert the

1038
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
so what we'll do we have to invert the
 

1039
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,990
so what we'll do we have to invert the
signal

1040
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000

 

1041
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,390

i'll just put down a bunch of repeaters

1042
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
i'll just put down a bunch of repeaters
 

1043
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:14,230
i'll just put down a bunch of repeaters
and tinker with them afterwards

1044
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240

 

1045
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,430

oh and

1046
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
oh and
 

1047
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,830
oh and
yeah okay let's connect these together

1048
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
yeah okay let's connect these together
 

1049
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,310
yeah okay let's connect these together
that won't work we need to

1050
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320

 

1051
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,310

go up and cut the wire

1052
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320

 

1053
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,029

and here we'll put a block

1054
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039

 

1055
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,029

that should work okay

1056
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039

 

1057
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,470

uh maybe we'll leave it that for now

1058
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
uh maybe we'll leave it that for now
 

1059
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,789
uh maybe we'll leave it that for now
that's should be a fairly short delay

1060
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
that's should be a fairly short delay
 

1061
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,950
that's should be a fairly short delay
because they're all at one

1062
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
because they're all at one
 

1063
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,190
because they're all at one
then run our repeaters back

1064
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200

 

1065
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,590

and yeah the water will be

1066
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
and yeah the water will be
 

1067
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,350
and yeah the water will be
right here

1068
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
right here
 

1069
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,470
right here
where that block is so uh we'll have to

1070
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
where that block is so uh we'll have to
 

1071
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,350
where that block is so uh we'll have to
have blocks

1072
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
have blocks
 

1073
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,350
have blocks
on all four sides so there's gonna be a

1074
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
on all four sides so there's gonna be a
 

1075
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,789
on all four sides so there's gonna be a
block

1076
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
block
 

1077
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,470
block
here that we'll have to run our wire

1078
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
here that we'll have to run our wire
 

1079
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,789
here that we'll have to run our wire
through

1080
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799

 

1081
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,310

on all these we're gonna put the water

1082
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
on all these we're gonna put the water
 

1083
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,830
on all these we're gonna put the water
in last so i want to make sure this is

1084
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
in last so i want to make sure this is
 

1085
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,390
in last so i want to make sure this is
right

1086
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
right
 

1087
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,549
right
just so i don't accidentally kill the

1088
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
just so i don't accidentally kill the
 

1089
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,390
just so i don't accidentally kill the
sheep again

1090
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400

 

1091
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,070

oh there has to be one here too

1092
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
oh there has to be one here too
 

1093
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,310
oh there has to be one here too
okay well i'll uh i'll get this line

1094
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
okay well i'll uh i'll get this line
 

1095
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,390
okay well i'll uh i'll get this line
done and we'll try it out

1096
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400

 

1097
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,310

all right let's give it a go here i'm

1098
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
all right let's give it a go here i'm
 

1099
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,549
all right let's give it a go here i'm
not sure if it's going to be bug free or

1100
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
not sure if it's going to be bug free or
 

1101
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,990
not sure if it's going to be bug free or
not but

1102
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,000

 

1103
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,110

that looked good that looked good

1104
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
that looked good that looked good
 

1105
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,029
that looked good that looked good
so we only want it open for a little

1106
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
so we only want it open for a little
 

1107
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,230
so we only want it open for a little
while

1108
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
while
 

1109
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,029
while
um that's way too short though the way

1110
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
um that's way too short though the way
 

1111
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,269
um that's way too short though the way
it

1112
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
it
 

1113
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,029
it
is right now so we'll add a little bit

1114
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
is right now so we'll add a little bit
 

1115
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,350
is right now so we'll add a little bit
more to it

1116
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
more to it
 

1117
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,149
more to it
to the delay at the end there i got more

1118
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
to the delay at the end there i got more
 

1119
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,510
to the delay at the end there i got more
repeaters on the other side

1120
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
repeaters on the other side
 

1121
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,549
repeaters on the other side
too uh

1122
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
too uh
 

1123
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,710
too uh
if there's quite a bit of leeway with

1124
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
if there's quite a bit of leeway with
 

1125
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,149
if there's quite a bit of leeway with
the water time i'll probably add some

1126
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
the water time i'll probably add some
 

1127
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,669
the water time i'll probably add some
more on the side

1128
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
more on the side
 

1129
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,310
more on the side
just to make the effect look better

1130
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320

 

1131
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,110

what are we going to do

1132
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120

 

1133
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,029

we're just doing dry runs for right now

1134
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
we're just doing dry runs for right now
 

1135
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,950
we're just doing dry runs for right now
we'll get to the wet run

1136
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
we'll get to the wet run
 

1137
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,470
we'll get to the wet run
soon see how that

1138
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
soon see how that
 

1139
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,070
soon see how that
is

1140
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080

 

1141
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,750

lots of redstone i'm gonna have to go

1142
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
lots of redstone i'm gonna have to go
 

1143
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:48,630
lots of redstone i'm gonna have to go
mine some more soon

1144
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640

 

1145
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,750

that looks cool uh maybe we can try to

1146
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
that looks cool uh maybe we can try to
 

1147
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,510
that looks cool uh maybe we can try to
run down to the other end

1148
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
run down to the other end
 

1149
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,870
run down to the other end
and see if we spot any glitches

1150
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
and see if we spot any glitches
 

1151
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,710
and see if we spot any glitches
i'm worried about that end one but i

1152
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
i'm worried about that end one but i
 

1153
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,789
i'm worried about that end one but i
guess we can't really see it

1154
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799

 

1155
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,310

maybe what we'll do

1156
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320

 

1157
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,230

is temporarily disconnect it here and

1158
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
is temporarily disconnect it here and
 

1159
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,029
is temporarily disconnect it here and
test it all on its own

1160
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
test it all on its own
 

1161
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:23,510
test it all on its own
let us

1162
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520

 

1163
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,190

i don't know if that's gonna work

1164
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200

 

1165
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,549

no that won't work because we don't have

1166
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
no that won't work because we don't have
 

1167
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:36,830
no that won't work because we don't have
the torch

1168
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840

 

1169
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,390

hmm

1170
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400

 

1171
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,269

a little close ooh what happened there

1172
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279

 

1173
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,029

okay that might have been from my

1174
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
okay that might have been from my
 

1175
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,909
okay that might have been from my
messing around i'm not sure

1176
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919

 

1177
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,269

um

1178
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279

 

1179
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,110

not sure we will we'll try it again one

1180
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
not sure we will we'll try it again one
 

1181
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,149
not sure we will we'll try it again one
more time

1182
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159

 

1183
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,990

and see if the block gets pushed with

1184
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
and see if the block gets pushed with
 

1185
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,470
and see if the block gets pushed with
the way it was before

1186
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480

 

1187
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,950

so there is a problem uh even with the

1188
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
so there is a problem uh even with the
 

1189
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,549
so there is a problem uh even with the
way it was originally it was pushing the

1190
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
way it was originally it was pushing the
 

1191
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,350
way it was originally it was pushing the
block down

1192
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
block down
 

1193
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,269
block down
so it's because i did this last one

1194
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
so it's because i did this last one
 

1195
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,590
so it's because i did this last one
differently um the tri-safe space

1196
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
differently um the tri-safe space
 

1197
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,470
differently um the tri-safe space
it goes inward with other pistons so

1198
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
it goes inward with other pistons so
 

1199
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,029
it goes inward with other pistons so
what i

1200
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
what i
 

1201
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,190
what i
think i need to do

1202
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200

 

1203
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,389

oh that's a problem too

1204
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
oh that's a problem too
 

1205
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,070
oh that's a problem too
we'll just cut it there we'll put

1206
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
we'll just cut it there we'll put
 

1207
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,269
we'll just cut it there we'll put
this back

1208
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279

 

1209
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,830

no that won't work uh if i do that it'll

1210
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
no that won't work uh if i do that it'll
 

1211
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,590
no that won't work uh if i do that it'll
send power to that wire again it'll

1212
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
send power to that wire again it'll
 

1213
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,070
send power to that wire again it'll
create a clock

1214
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080

 

1215
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,310

so we'll keep it like this i guess

1216
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320

 

1217
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,789

and then have the repeater on the other

1218
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
and then have the repeater on the other
 

1219
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,669
and then have the repeater on the other
side

1220
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679

 

1221
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,710

and hopefully

1222
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720

 

1223
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:23,909

that fixes it

1224
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919

 

1225
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,990

okay because the holes over there not

1226
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
okay because the holes over there not
 

1227
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,430
okay because the holes over there not
not where it made one

1228
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440

 

1229
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,190

actually it's it's not extended either

1230
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
actually it's it's not extended either
 

1231
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:42,830
actually it's it's not extended either
is it

1232
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840

 

1233
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,070

hmm

1234
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
hmm
 

1235
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,510
hmm
me trouble

1236
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520

 

1237
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,190

okay we'll we'll have it in the right

1238
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
okay we'll we'll have it in the right
 

1239
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,110
okay we'll we'll have it in the right
state to start with just to make sure

1240
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
state to start with just to make sure
 

1241
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,750
state to start with just to make sure
and let's give it a go i think that'll

1242
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
and let's give it a go i think that'll
 

1243
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,549
and let's give it a go i think that'll
fix it

1244
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
fix it
 

1245
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,789
fix it
moving the repeater there i think that

1246
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
moving the repeater there i think that
 

1247
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:09,029
moving the repeater there i think that
did the trick

1248
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,039

 

1249
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,350

please please please yes

1250
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
please please please yes
 

1251
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,190
please please please yes
that did it pretty sure

1252
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
that did it pretty sure
 

1253
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,630
that did it pretty sure
yeah okay so it's working now uh i'm

1254
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
yeah okay so it's working now uh i'm
 

1255
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,470
yeah okay so it's working now uh i'm
gonna put the water in now and we'll

1256
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
gonna put the water in now and we'll
 

1257
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,110
gonna put the water in now and we'll
we'll give it a go

1258
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
we'll give it a go
 

1259
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,430
we'll give it a go
there we go we got the water in place

1260
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
there we go we got the water in place
 

1261
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,029
there we go we got the water in place
and uh you can see

1262
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
and uh you can see
 

1263
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,590
and uh you can see
the water just sits right above the the

1264
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
the water just sits right above the the
 

1265
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,549
the water just sits right above the the
piston that's

1266
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
piston that's
 

1267
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,510
piston that's
the cork there uh when the sticky piston

1268
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
the cork there uh when the sticky piston
 

1269
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,110
the cork there uh when the sticky piston
pulls it out of the way the water goes

1270
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
pulls it out of the way the water goes
 

1271
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,510
pulls it out of the way the water goes
straight down the hole so pretty good

1272
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
straight down the hole so pretty good
 

1273
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,669
straight down the hole so pretty good
i've made a world back up because this

1274
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
i've made a world back up because this
 

1275
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,990
i've made a world back up because this
is where things can get

1276
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
is where things can get
 

1277
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,070
is where things can get
really bad really quick so

1278
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,080
really bad really quick so
 

1279
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,789
really bad really quick so
let's hope for the best uh i also ran

1280
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
let's hope for the best uh i also ran
 

1281
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,310
let's hope for the best uh i also ran
this down here just so we can see it

1282
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
this down here just so we can see it
 

1283
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,710
this down here just so we can see it
when we press it

1284
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
when we press it
 

1285
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,149
when we press it
first try

1286
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159

 

1287
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,830

oh and that is why i made a world back

1288
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
oh and that is why i made a world back
 

1289
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,230
oh and that is why i made a world back
up

1290
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
up
 

1291
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,510
up
i forgot ah nuts

1292
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
i forgot ah nuts
 

1293
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,070
i forgot ah nuts
okay i'm gonna load the back up i need

1294
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
okay i'm gonna load the back up i need
 

1295
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,070
okay i'm gonna load the back up i need
i need like a something here to hold the

1296
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
i need like a something here to hold the
 

1297
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,990
i need like a something here to hold the
water in

1298
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
water in
 

1299
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,710
water in
all right this will do for now uh i also

1300
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
all right this will do for now uh i also
 

1301
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,190
all right this will do for now uh i also
put one of these on the back wall

1302
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,200
put one of these on the back wall
 

1303
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,149
put one of these on the back wall
so it doesn't flow down there either i

1304
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,159
so it doesn't flow down there either i
 

1305
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,310
so it doesn't flow down there either i
just noticed that two of my sheep are

1306
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
just noticed that two of my sheep are
 

1307
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,190
just noticed that two of my sheep are
dead

1308
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
dead
 

1309
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,389
dead
are gone or something don't

1310
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
are gone or something don't
 

1311
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,909
are gone or something don't
know when that happened or why

1312
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
know when that happened or why
 

1313
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,549
know when that happened or why
um so i'll have to replace them i guess

1314
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
um so i'll have to replace them i guess
 

1315
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:56,870
um so i'll have to replace them i guess
um anyway let's try it out

1316
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880

 

1317
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,149

okay that seems pretty close to what we

1318
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
okay that seems pretty close to what we
 

1319
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,710
okay that seems pretty close to what we
want

1320
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
want
 

1321
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,990
want
uh we will give it an

1322
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
uh we will give it an
 

1323
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,549
uh we will give it an
actual go here so only if there is wool

1324
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
actual go here so only if there is wool
 

1325
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,269
actual go here so only if there is wool
there will they get reset

1326
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
there will they get reset
 

1327
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,630
there will they get reset
that's the idea anyway

1328
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640

 

1329
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,389

see if it'll move it far enough in that

1330
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
see if it'll move it far enough in that
 

1331
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,950
see if it'll move it far enough in that
time i don't think it will

1332
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
time i don't think it will
 

1333
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,990
time i don't think it will
nope that one piece stayed

1334
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
nope that one piece stayed
 

1335
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,830
nope that one piece stayed
is close but we need a little bit more

1336
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:30,840
is close but we need a little bit more
 

1337
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,590
is close but we need a little bit more
delay

1338
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
delay
 

1339
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,149
delay
the sheep went down right

1340
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159

 

1341
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,430

yeah there's the wool

1342
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440

 

1343
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,669

so the benefit of doing it that way is

1344
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
so the benefit of doing it that way is
 

1345
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,590
so the benefit of doing it that way is
it

1346
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
it
 

1347
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,549
it
it'll automatically get them down and

1348
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
it'll automatically get them down and
 

1349
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,269
it'll automatically get them down and
it'll collect their wool automatically

1350
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
it'll collect their wool automatically
 

1351
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,110
it'll collect their wool automatically
and if they're in the middle of a cycle

1352
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
and if they're in the middle of a cycle
 

1353
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,310
and if they're in the middle of a cycle
like

1354
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
like
 

1355
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,909
like
if they're down here but the grass has

1356
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
if they're down here but the grass has
 

1357
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,590
if they're down here but the grass has
grown it won't interrupt that

1358
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
grown it won't interrupt that
 

1359
