thank you for taking part in my
psychological experiment

186
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
psychological experiment
 

187
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,030
psychological experiment
all right well that was weird

188
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
choice um
 

195
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,149
choice um
i'm assuming those are the only ones

196
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
i'm assuming those are the only ones
 

197
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,869
i'm assuming those are the only ones

still watching anyway
 

199
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,110
still watching anyway
uh the real test is the reaction i'm

200
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
uh the real test is the reaction i'm
 

201
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,469
uh the real test is the reaction i'm
curious what kind of reaction i'm gonna

202
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
curious what kind of reaction i'm gonna
 

203
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,069
curious what kind of reaction i'm gonna
get on that

204

cave

208
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
cave
 

209
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,749
cave
i was kind of running around here today

210
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
i was kind of running around here today
 

211
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,110
i was kind of running around here today
thinking about different

212
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
thinking about different
 

213
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,510
thinking about different
things i want to do and i came up with

214
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
things i want to do and i came up with
 

215
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,590
things i want to do and i came up with
quite a few actually

216
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
quite a few actually
 

217
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,350
quite a few actually
so we're just going to go around

218
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360

 

219
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,510

and fix some stuff maybe build some

220
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
and fix some stuff maybe build some
 

221
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,189
and fix some stuff maybe build some
stuff we'll see

222
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
stuff we'll see
 

223
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,430
stuff we'll see
one thing i did prepare already is a

224
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
one thing i did prepare already is a
 

225
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,150
one thing i did prepare already is a
whole bunch of jungle leaves

226
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
whole bunch of jungle leaves
 

227
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,189
whole bunch of jungle leaves
because we have this

228
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
because we have this
 

229
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,350
because we have this
place jungle leaves over there there's

230
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
place jungle leaves over there there's
 

231
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,189
place jungle leaves over there there's
jungle leaves here

232
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
jungle leaves here
 

233
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,870
jungle leaves here
here here i think that's the theme i've

234
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
here here i think that's the theme i've
 

235
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,629
here here i think that's the theme i've
i've gone with with this so i think we

236
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
i've gone with with this so i think we
 

237
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,469
i've gone with with this so i think we
should replace this with them

238
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
should replace this with them
 

239
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,990
should replace this with them
this one and this one too at least

240
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
this one and this one too at least
 

241
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,350
this one and this one too at least
so let's go ahead and do that

242
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360

 

243
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,070

um i've been having some computer

244
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
um i've been having some computer
 

245
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,870
um i've been having some computer
issues lately and i finally figured out

246
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
issues lately and i finally figured out
 

247
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,310
issues lately and i finally figured out
why

248
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
why
 

249
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,909
why
uh and i'm experimenting with it on this

250
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
uh and i'm experimenting with it on this
 

251
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,629
uh and i'm experimenting with it on this
video

252
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
video
 

253
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,790
video
but basically when i would go to record

254
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
but basically when i would go to record
 

255
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,629
but basically when i would go to record
when i'd hit f9 on my keyboard that's

256
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
when i'd hit f9 on my keyboard that's
 

257
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,350
when i'd hit f9 on my keyboard that's
what i that's my record button

258
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
what i that's my record button
 

259
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,150
what i that's my record button
i quite often would have it go down to

260
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
i quite often would have it go down to
 

261
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,950
i quite often would have it go down to
15 frames per second or 10 or

262
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
15 frames per second or 10 or
 

263
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,830
15 frames per second or 10 or
or something like that or if i if i did

264
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
or something like that or if i if i did
 

265
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,870
or something like that or if i if i did
manage to get it to go to

266
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
manage to get it to go to
 

267
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,670
manage to get it to go to
30 that's what i'm trying to record at

268
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
30 that's what i'm trying to record at
 

269
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,790
30 that's what i'm trying to record at
uh

270
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
uh
 

271
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,310
uh
it'll be fine and then after a few

272
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
it'll be fine and then after a few
 

273
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,230
it'll be fine and then after a few
minutes when it splits the video into

274
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
minutes when it splits the video into
 

275
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,070
minutes when it splits the video into
another file

276
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
another file
 

277
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,510
another file
then there was a chance it would go down

278
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
then there was a chance it would go down
 

279
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,189
then there was a chance it would go down
to 15 or 10

280
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
to 15 or 10
 

281
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,790
to 15 or 10
and you may have noticed my videos

282
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
and you may have noticed my videos
 

283
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,790
and you may have noticed my videos
getting kind of choppy in places that's

284
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
getting kind of choppy in places that's
 

285
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,590
getting kind of choppy in places that's
that's why i thought it was my hard

286
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
that's why i thought it was my hard
 

287
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,950
that's why i thought it was my hard
drive failing

288
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
drive failing
 

289
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,870
drive failing
actually but it turns out

290
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
actually but it turns out
 

291
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,670
actually but it turns out
it's because i did not have uh lock

292
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
it's because i did not have uh lock
 

293
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,469
it's because i did not have uh lock
frames

294
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
frames
 

295
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,909
frames
set on fraps which

296
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
set on fraps which
 

297
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,350
set on fraps which
i was trying to figure out why i didn't

298
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
i was trying to figure out why i didn't
 

299
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,189
i was trying to figure out why i didn't
have that enabled like to lock the

300
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
have that enabled like to lock the
 

301
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,950
have that enabled like to lock the
frames that locks it at 30

302
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
frames that locks it at 30
 

303
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,510
frames that locks it at 30
so if you get less than 30 the video

304
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
so if you get less than 30 the video
 

305
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,790
so if you get less than 30 the video
will just look jerky but it will still

306
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
will just look jerky but it will still
 

307
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,469
will just look jerky but it will still
be recording at 30.

308
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
be recording at 30.
 

309
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,270
be recording at 30.
and i i remember why i didn't have that

310
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
and i i remember why i didn't have that
 

311
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,950
and i i remember why i didn't have that
enabled a long long time ago like i've

312
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
enabled a long long time ago like i've
 

313
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,790
enabled a long long time ago like i've
had this computer for two three years

314
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
had this computer for two three years
 

315
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,909
had this computer for two three years
now

316
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
now
 

317
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,790
now
and been doing this youtube thing for

318
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
and been doing this youtube thing for
 

319
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,029
and been doing this youtube thing for
about that long too

320
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
about that long too
 

321
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,189
about that long too
and when i first started i was able to

322
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
and when i first started i was able to
 

323
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,790
and when i first started i was able to
record minecraft at

324
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
record minecraft at
 

325
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,110
record minecraft at
like 90 frames per second

326
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
like 90 frames per second
 

327
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,029
like 90 frames per second
i think i think at 1080p no problem

328
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
i think i think at 1080p no problem
 

329
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,270
i think i think at 1080p no problem
and if i had the lock enabled uh

330
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
and if i had the lock enabled uh
 

331
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,350
and if i had the lock enabled uh
it would lower my frame rate down to 30

332
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
it would lower my frame rate down to 30
 

333
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,390
it would lower my frame rate down to 30
even though i could record

334
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
even though i could record
 

335
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,390
even though i could record
at 90. like it forces it no matter what

336
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400

 

337
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,670

that looks pretty good um

338
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680

 

339
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,950

other issue with it i don't know that
could be it too

348
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
could be it too
 

349
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,749
could be it too
but i can just barely record it 30

350
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
but i can just barely record it 30
 

351
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,309
but i can just barely record it 30
frames now it's like between 30 and 45

352
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
frames now it's like between 30 and 45
 

353
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,189
frames now it's like between 30 and 45
i'm getting

354
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
i'm getting
 

355
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,430
i'm getting
and the reason i'm having trouble now is

356
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
and the reason i'm having trouble now is
 

357
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,230
and the reason i'm having trouble now is
because

358
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
because
 

359
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,990
because
since 1.5 or whatever uh

360
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
since 1.5 or whatever uh
 

361
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,029
since 1.5 or whatever uh
it can't do 30 usually so it will just

362
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
it can't do 30 usually so it will just
 

363
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,710
it can't do 30 usually so it will just
default to 15 when i start recording

364
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
default to 15 when i start recording
 

365
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,309
default to 15 when i start recording
but just because i think it's

366
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
but just because i think it's
 

367
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,870
but just because i think it's
it has extra load when i starts but

368
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
it has extra load when i starts but
 

369
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,350
it has extra load when i starts but
anyway i got it sorted out now

370
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
anyway i got it sorted out now
 

371
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,110
anyway i got it sorted out now
we can record properly again so

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
we can record properly again so
 

373
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,950
we can record properly again so
that's good i tried defragging my hard

374
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
that's good i tried defragging my hard
 

375
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,790

385
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,110
door i think it's kind of glitched
so i have a pressure plate there to open

386
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
so i have a pressure plate there to open
 

387
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,150
so i have a pressure plate there to open
it this goes into our potion ingredients

388
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160

 

389
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,990

yeah these pressure plates don't work

390
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
yeah these pressure plates don't work
 

391
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,430
yeah these pressure plates don't work
anymore it's like they don't even go

392
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
anymore it's like they don't even go
 

393
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,350
anymore it's like they don't even go
down like i walk over it

394
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
down like i walk over it
 

395
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,749
down like i walk over it
and they don't move i might have to just

396
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
and they don't move i might have to just
 

397
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,909
and they don't move i might have to just
replace them

398
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
replace them
 

399
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,990
replace them
but i've been noticing this and i don't

it's not like a redstone problem it's a
 

411
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,670
it's not like a redstone problem it's a
pressure plate problem do they work here

412
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
pressure plate problem do they work here
 

413
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,589
pressure plate problem do they work here
no hmm

414
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
no hmm
 

415
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,990
no hmm
let's try make new ones maybe

416
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000

 

417
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,949

i don't think they would have a

418
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
i don't think they would have a
 

419
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:56,310
i don't think they would have a
different id but you never know

420
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320

 

421
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,550

huh uh i don't understand
 

423
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,829
huh uh i don't understand

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560

 

429
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,630

it's very weird okay wooden ones do work

430
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
it's very weird okay wooden ones do work
 

431
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,670
it's very weird okay wooden ones do work
stone ones should too though

432
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680

 

433
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,630

that is so strange

434
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640

 

435
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,710

about that i don't
 

439
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,990
about that i don't
want wooden ones i kind of want the

440
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
want wooden ones i kind of want the
 

441
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,949
want wooden ones i kind of want the
stone look

442
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
stone look
 

443
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,190
stone look
but all right we'll keep that in mind

444
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
but all right we'll keep that in mind
 

445
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,790

uh the other thing though i kind of want

446
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
uh the other thing though i kind of want
 

447
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,310
uh the other thing though i kind of want
to get rid of this wooden pressure plate

448
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
to get rid of this wooden pressure plate
 

449
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,190
to get rid of this wooden pressure plate
here because

450
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
here because
 

451
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,389
here because
when we first made this door we had

452
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
when we first made this door we had
 

453
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,070
when we first made this door we had
three wooden ones going across

454
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
three wooden ones going across
 

455
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,829
three wooden ones going across
and we didn't have these paths to the

456
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
and we didn't have these paths to the
 

457
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,110
and we didn't have these paths to the
left or the right

458
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
left or the right
 

459
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,630
left or the right
oh there's the other one uh

460
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
oh there's the other one uh
 

461
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,230
oh there's the other one uh
now we do though so when we go up the

462
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
now we do though so when we go up the
 

463
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,750
now we do though so when we go up the
stairs we might not necessarily want to

464
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
stairs we might not necessarily want to
 

465
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,350
stairs we might not necessarily want to
go into this room anymore

466
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
go into this room anymore
 

467
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,230
go into this room anymore
we might want to go here or here so i

468
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
we might want to go here or here so i
 

469
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,990
we might want to go here or here so i
removed two of the pressure plates but

470
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
removed two of the pressure plates but
 

471
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,030
removed two of the pressure plates but
we still have this

472
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
we still have this
 

473
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,069
we still have this
one that i sometimes step on

474
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
one that i sometimes step on
 

475
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,550
one that i sometimes step on
uh we're gonna get rid of it though and

476
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
uh we're gonna get rid of it though and

479
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,190

new way of opening the door so this is

480
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
new way of opening the door so this is
 

481
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,310
new way of opening the door so this is
the line of redstone

482
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
the line of redstone
 

483
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,790
the line of redstone
here that we're activating

484
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800

 

485
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,350

i hate looking at old wiring i'm always

486
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
i hate looking at old wiring i'm always
 

487
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,230
i hate looking at old wiring i'm always
it's like oh why did i do that

trying to interpol through the door you

526
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
trying to interpol through the door you
 

527
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,110
trying to interpol through the door you
can do it from a distance

528
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
can do it from a distance
 

529
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,509
can do it from a distance
but i don't think you can understand

530
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
but i don't think you can understand
 

531
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,269
but i don't think you can understand
that might be to prevent that even i

532
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
that might be to prevent that even i
 

533
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,670
that might be to prevent that even i
don't know

534
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680

 

535
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,670

anyway it's not a problem with wooden

536
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
anyway it's not a problem with wooden
 

537
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,110
anyway it's not a problem with wooden
doors i just checked too

538
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
doors i just checked too
 

539
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,190
doors i just checked too
because you open it

540
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200

 

541
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,829

although you can't eat anyway let's stop

542
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
although you can't eat anyway let's stop
 

543
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,030
although you can't eat anyway let's stop
doing that

544
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
doing that
 

545
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,590
doing that
uh what we're going to do now with this

546
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
uh what we're going to do now with this
 

547
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,870
uh what we're going to do now with this
door

548
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
door
 

549
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,150
door
instead of using a pressure plate

550
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
instead of using a pressure plate
 

551
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,990
instead of using a pressure plate
because when i come up these stairs i

552
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
because when i come up these stairs i
 

553
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,269
because when i come up these stairs i
always

554
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279

 

555
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,350

close your eyes people you saw nothing

556
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
close your eyes people you saw nothing
 

557
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,590
close your eyes people you saw nothing
uh when i come up these stairs i tend to

558
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
uh when i come up these stairs i tend to
 

559
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,870
uh when i come up these stairs i tend to
bump this pressure plate like if i'm

560
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
bump this pressure plate like if i'm
 

561
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,190
bump this pressure plate like if i'm
going to the right here now very often i

562
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
going to the right here now very often i
 

563
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,150
going to the right here now very often i
would walk over it

564
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
would walk over it
 

565
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,750
would walk over it
so we're going to change this to a new

566
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
so we're going to change this to a new
 

567
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,030
so we're going to change this to a new
type of activator i hope

568
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
type of activator i hope
 

569
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,870
type of activator i hope
and we're going to use a minecart hopper

570
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
and we're going to use a minecart hopper
 

571
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,230
and we're going to use a minecart hopper
because there's a really cool

572
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
because there's a really cool
 

573
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,389
because there's a really cool
feature or ability with it that i hope

574
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
feature or ability with it that i hope
 

575
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,949
feature or ability with it that i hope
doesn't get removed because it's

576
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
doesn't get removed because it's
 

577
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,230
doesn't get removed because it's
it's not something you could do

578
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
it's not something you could do
 

579
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,150
it's not something you could do
previously it's really cool

580
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
previously it's really cool
 

581
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,790
previously it's really cool
uh if you have

582
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800

 

583
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,350

let's trigger this can we trigger this

584
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360

 

585
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,590

i thought we could

586
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600

 

587
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,590

wait why can't we trigger this oh

588
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
wait why can't we trigger this oh
 

589
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,230
wait why can't we trigger this oh
because it's being powered

590
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
because it's being powered
 

591
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,150
because it's being powered
um wait a second

592
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
um wait a second
 

593
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,389
um wait a second
that that didn't work um

594
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
that that didn't work um
 

595
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,949
that that didn't work um
i need to let's get this button back

596
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
i need to let's get this button back
 

597
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,150
i need to let's get this button back
okay we need to switch this unpowered uh

598
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
okay we need to switch this unpowered uh
 

599
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,470
okay we need to switch this unpowered uh
what we are going to do i'll just show

600
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
what we are going to do i'll just show
 

601
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,710
what we are going to do i'll just show
you the trick

602
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
you the trick
 

603
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,069
you the trick
if we have a hopper

604
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079

 

605
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,990

uh over here no not that low

606
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
uh over here no not that low
 

607
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,350
uh over here no not that low
let's put a hopper over here and then we

608
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
let's put a hopper over here and then we
 

609
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,310
let's put a hopper over here and then we
have

610
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
have
 

611
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,269
have
a track on top and the minecart hopper

612
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
a track on top and the minecart hopper
 

613
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,870
a track on top and the minecart hopper
if we

614
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880

 

615
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,829

let's go back up if we throw an item on

616
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
let's go back up if we throw an item on
 

617
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,509
let's go back up if we throw an item on
the ground it has this cool ability

618
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
the ground it has this cool ability
 

619
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,110
the ground it has this cool ability
where it can pit it up through the

620
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
where it can pit it up through the
 

621
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,470
where it can pit it up through the
ground

622
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
ground
 

623
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,230
ground
like that which is really really cool

624
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
like that which is really really cool
 

625
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,590
like that which is really really cool
and that gets put down into this hopper

626
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
and that gets put down into this hopper
 

627
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,189
and that gets put down into this hopper
so we're going to use that to open the

628
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
so we're going to use that to open the
 

629
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,990
so we're going to use that to open the
door and close it

630
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000

 

631
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,150

i think that would be pretty cool and

632
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
i think that would be pretty cool and
 

633
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,430
i think that would be pretty cool and
it's better than a pressure plate

634
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
it's better than a pressure plate
 

635
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,230
it's better than a pressure plate
because the mob

636
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
because the mob
 

637
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,389
because the mob
has no ability to activate this

638
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
has no ability to activate this
 

639
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,509
has no ability to activate this
so what we should do

640
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
so what we should do
 

641
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,110
so what we should do
let's get a comparator the thing i'm

642
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
let's get a comparator the thing i'm
 

643
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,910
let's get a comparator the thing i'm
worried about is

644
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
worried about is
 

645
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,629
worried about is
oh when this is powered i don't think

646
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
oh when this is powered i don't think
 

647
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,310
oh when this is powered i don't think
items are going to go through the hopper

648
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
items are going to go through the hopper
 

649
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,990
items are going to go through the hopper
yeah if the door is i think closed

650
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
yeah if the door is i think closed
 

651
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,949
yeah if the door is i think closed
yeah closed uh we won't be able to open

652
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
yeah closed uh we won't be able to open
 

653
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,310
yeah closed uh we won't be able to open
it doing that because

654
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
it doing that because
 

655
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,470
it doing that because
items are just jumping off being powered

656
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
items are just jumping off being powered
 

657
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,670
items are just jumping off being powered
right now

658
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
right now
 

659
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,550
right now
i think we may be able to modify this

660
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
i think we may be able to modify this
 

661
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,829
i think we may be able to modify this
and lower

662
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
and lower
 

663
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,230
and lower
the redstone though i hope oh what was

664
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
the redstone though i hope oh what was
 

665
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,870
the redstone though i hope oh what was
that that was

666
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
that that was
 

667
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,150
that that was
one oh no i should have checked before i

668
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
one oh no i should have checked before i
 

669
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,590
one oh no i should have checked before i
broke that

670
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
broke that
 

671
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,389
broke that
uh i'll have to lower this

672
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
uh i'll have to lower this
 

673
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,150
uh i'll have to lower this
tell you what i'll do some of this off

674
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
tell you what i'll do some of this off
 

675

things today and i don't want to waste
 

679
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,710
things today and i don't want to waste
all our time on this

680
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720

 

681
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,949

okay i added that in it's actually a

682
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
okay i added that in it's actually a
 

683
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,629
okay i added that in it's actually a
really simple thing there's not much to

684
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
really simple thing there's not much to
 

685
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:52,870
really simple thing there's not much to
it

686
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
it
 

687
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,629
it
so now to open the door

688
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
so now to open the door
 

689
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,910
so now to open the door
give it a junk block of any type we want

690
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
give it a junk block of any type we want
 

691
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,509
give it a junk block of any type we want
i will put wooden pressure plates here

692
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
i will put wooden pressure plates here
 

693
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,150
i will put wooden pressure plates here
until that gets fixed

694
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
until that gets fixed
 

695
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,829
until that gets fixed
and then to close it again

696
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839

 

697
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,670

pretty cool uh it's it's actually not

698
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
pretty cool uh it's it's actually not
 

699
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,269
pretty cool uh it's it's actually not
too bad either like check this out

700
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279

 

701
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,110

it's like how did he open that door

702
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
it's like how did he open that door
 

703
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,629
it's like how did he open that door
that's crazy i didn't see him do

704
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
that's crazy i didn't see him do
 

705
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,150
that's crazy i didn't see him do
anything

706
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
anything
 

707
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,590
anything
uh oh i messed up that time if you throw

708
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
uh oh i messed up that time if you throw
 

709
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,710
uh oh i messed up that time if you throw
it while you're running you

710
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
it while you're running you
 

711
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,069
it while you're running you
you don't even see it go out of your

712
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
you don't even see it go out of your
 

713
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,189
you don't even see it go out of your
inventory really

714
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199

 

715
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,629

that's cool i like that

716
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
that's cool i like that
 

717
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,870
that's cool i like that
and let's just go check it out here i

718
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
and let's just go check it out here i
 

719
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,470
and let's just go check it out here i
pretty things up a little bit down here

720
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
pretty things up a little bit down here
 

721
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,910
pretty things up a little bit down here
too because i didn't like the cobble

722
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
too because i didn't like the cobble
 

723
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,790
too because i didn't like the cobble
look

724
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
look
 

725
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,910
look
uh here's the minecarts on the hopper i

726
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
uh here's the minecarts on the hopper i
 

727
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,430
uh here's the minecarts on the hopper i
put these half slabs here because i kept

728
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
put these half slabs here because i kept
 

729
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,350
put these half slabs here because i kept
bumping it and then it wasn't working

730
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
bumping it and then it wasn't working
 

731
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,069
bumping it and then it wasn't working
so now it's gonna be held in place uh

732
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
so now it's gonna be held in place uh
 

733
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,590
so now it's gonna be held in place uh
that goes down to

734
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
that goes down to
 

735
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,949
that goes down to
a dropper the hopper

736
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
a dropper the hopper
 

737
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,470
a dropper the hopper
uh and the reason i'm doing that is so

738
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
uh and the reason i'm doing that is so
 

739
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,790
uh and the reason i'm doing that is so
it will shoot the item out it picks up

740
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
it will shoot the item out it picks up
 

741
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,150
it will shoot the item out it picks up
because i don't want it

742
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
because i don't want it
 

743
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,670
because i don't want it
eventually filling up my chest or

744
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
eventually filling up my chest or
 

745
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,470
eventually filling up my chest or
something then i have to empty it

746
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480

 

747
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,949

every junk item gets expelled that you

748
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
every junk item gets expelled that you
 

749
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,470
every junk item gets expelled that you
throw in it

750
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
throw in it
 

751
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,389
throw in it
so that goes to the comparator this

752
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
so that goes to the comparator this
 

753
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,389
so that goes to the comparator this
block there's redstone wire underneath

754
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
block there's redstone wire underneath
 

755
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,110
block there's redstone wire underneath
this block you you can't see it which

756
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
this block you you can't see it which
 

757
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,870
this block you you can't see it which
points to this block

758
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
points to this block
 

759
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,189
points to this block
and the repeater and then to that and up

760
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
and the repeater and then to that and up
 

761
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,269
and the repeater and then to that and up
to the dropper

762
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
to the dropper
 

763
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,590
to the dropper
and the rest of it's just pretty much as

764
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
and the rest of it's just pretty much as
 

765
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,550
and the rest of it's just pretty much as
it was i had to

766
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560

 

767
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,990

this is from the pressure plates on the

768
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
this is from the pressure plates on the
 

769
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,790
this is from the pressure plates on the
other side they go through this way

770
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
other side they go through this way
 

771
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,629
other side they go through this way
and everything goes up to this one point

772
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
and everything goes up to this one point
 

773
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,710
and everything goes up to this one point
here and

774
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
here and
 

775
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,269
here and
and then it's like the door like normal

776
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
and then it's like the door like normal
 

777
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,790
and then it's like the door like normal
so that's cool this was it too by the

778
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
so that's cool this was it too by the
 

779
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,509
so that's cool this was it too by the
way

780
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
way
 

781
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,790
way
uh that is all

782
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
uh that is all
 

783
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,110
uh that is all
good and done we hardly go in this room

784
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
good and done we hardly go in this room
 

785
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,829
good and done we hardly go in this room
anyway

786
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
anyway
 

787
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,269
anyway
but i kind of wanted to get rid of that

788
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
but i kind of wanted to get rid of that
 

789
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,430
but i kind of wanted to get rid of that
pressure plate and we did it

790
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
pressure plate and we did it
 

791
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,870
pressure plate and we did it
uh the next thing on my list is this

792
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
uh the next thing on my list is this
 

793
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,789
uh the next thing on my list is this
area here we still have some torches

794
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
area here we still have some torches
 

795
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,470
area here we still have some torches
here and our goal is to get rid of

796
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
here and our goal is to get rid of
 

797
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,870
here and our goal is to get rid of
all the torches in our cave which we're

798
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
all the torches in our cave which we're
 

799
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,630
all the torches in our cave which we're
doing a really good job on like

800
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
doing a really good job on like
 

801
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,590
doing a really good job on like
there's there's no torches here guys

802
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
there's there's no torches here guys
 

803
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,189
there's there's no torches here guys
believe it or not we made it work

804
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
believe it or not we made it work
 

805
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,549
believe it or not we made it work
for most our cave most the finished

806
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
for most our cave most the finished
 

807
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,069
for most our cave most the finished
areas

808
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
areas
 

809
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,710
areas
if we get rid of all these

810
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720

 

811
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,230

does that lower the light level down to

812
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
does that lower the light level down to
 

813
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,590
does that lower the light level down to
oh yeah it's way too dark

814
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600

 

815
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,350

so we could either put some lights in

816
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
so we could either put some lights in
 

817
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,710
so we could either put some lights in
the walls

818
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
the walls
 

819
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,870
the walls
lights under the water but they wouldn't

820
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
lights under the water but they wouldn't
 

821
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,909
lights under the water but they wouldn't
work too well or lights in the ceiling

822
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
work too well or lights in the ceiling
 

823
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,950
work too well or lights in the ceiling
is another option um

824
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960

 

825
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,190

actually before we do that

826
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
actually before we do that
 

827
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,390
actually before we do that
i never really liked

828
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400

 

829
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,710

the look of this over here it's like a

830
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
the look of this over here it's like a
 

831
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,510
the look of this over here it's like a
stone

832
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
stone
 

833
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,549
stone
corner uh maybe we could

834
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
corner uh maybe we could
 

835
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,590
corner uh maybe we could
change this so that the water comes from

836
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
change this so that the water comes from
 

837
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,830
change this so that the water comes from
above because it just this is water i

838
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
above because it just this is water i
 

839
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,110
above because it just this is water i
placed here it doesn't really come from

840
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
placed here it doesn't really come from
 

841
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,909
placed here it doesn't really come from
anywhere

842

anywhere
 

843
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,750
anywhere
which can look a little strange maybe we

844
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
which can look a little strange maybe we
 

845
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,270
which can look a little strange maybe we
can make water come down

846
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
can make water come down
 

847
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,430
can make water come down
here is that possible what's this

848
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
here is that possible what's this
 

849
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,270
here is that possible what's this
that's from the chicken farm which we

850
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
that's from the chicken farm which we
 

851
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,549
that's from the chicken farm which we
need to fix as well

852
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
need to fix as well
 

853
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,710
need to fix as well
let's

854
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720

 

855
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,789

let's do that oh i thought i fell for a

856
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
let's do that oh i thought i fell for a
 

857
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,750
let's do that oh i thought i fell for a
second there

858
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
second there
 

859
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,110
second there
uh make it go up

860
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120

 

861
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,830

does this look better if we do it this

862
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840

 

863
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,310

way

864
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
way
 

865
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,990
way
uh

866
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000

 

867
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,029

no i don't like that option two let's

868
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
no i don't like that option two let's
 

869
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,789
no i don't like that option two let's

873
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,070

maybe that'll look better and then the

874
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
maybe that'll look better and then the
 

875
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,070
maybe that'll look better and then the
water back where it was

876
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080

 

877
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,549

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
different lighting methods
 

909
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,270
different lighting methods
are good they add variety i was thinking

910
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
are good they add variety i was thinking
 

911
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,310
are good they add variety i was thinking
about putting

912
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
about putting
 

913
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,470
about putting
lamps here i'm not too sure how good

914
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
lamps here i'm not too sure how good
 

915
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,590
lamps here i'm not too sure how good
these will look though

916
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600

 

917
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,630

let's cover these up

918
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640

 

919
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,070

to light the lower part because it

920
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
to light the lower part because it
 

921
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,990
to light the lower part because it
doesn't quite light it up enough with

922
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
doesn't quite light it up enough with
 

923
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,950
doesn't quite light it up enough with
just those

924
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960

 

925
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,190

um

926
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200

 

927
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,110

hmm what if we let's try a few different

928
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
hmm what if we let's try a few different
 

929
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,310
hmm what if we let's try a few different
things here

930
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
things here
 

931
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,909
things here
do that too

932
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919

 

933
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:23,430

um oops

934
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440

 

935
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,510

huh another option

936
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520

 

937
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,830

yeah another option actually let's take

938
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
yeah another option actually let's take
 

939
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,350
yeah another option actually let's take
these back

940
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360

 

941
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,430

maybe we won't do that they look a

942
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
maybe we won't do that they look a
 

943
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,549
maybe we won't do that they look a
little out of place

944
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
little out of place
 

945
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,230
little out of place
they got that dark outline around them

946
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
they got that dark outline around them
 

947
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,549
they got that dark outline around them
and i have a feeling glowstone would

948
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
and i have a feeling glowstone would
 

949
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,710
and i have a feeling glowstone would
look a little weird too

950
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
look a little weird too
 

951
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,310
look a little weird too
let's do or let's try this let's put

952
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
let's do or let's try this let's put
 

953
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,350
let's do or let's try this let's put
uh maybe

954
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
uh maybe
 

955
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,990
uh maybe
see can we do yeah we can do that so

956
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
see can we do yeah we can do that so
 

957
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,789
see can we do yeah we can do that so
let's put

958
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
let's put
 

959
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,470
let's put
a light up here

960
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480

 

961
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,830

and one over here and see what this

962
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
and one over here and see what this
 

963
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,470
and one over here and see what this
looks like

964
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480

 

965
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,990

kind of up and out of the way that way

966
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
kind of up and out of the way that way
 

967
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,029
kind of up and out of the way that way
and it sort of matches this one i would

968
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
and it sort of matches this one i would
 

969
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,590
and it sort of matches this one i would
do it

970
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
do it
 

971
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,750
do it
more of these uh type of lights lower

972
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
more of these uh type of lights lower
 

973
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,190
more of these uh type of lights lower
except it gets

974
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
except it gets
 

975
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,710
except it gets
it gets shorter and shorter at the

976
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
it gets shorter and shorter at the
 

977
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,710
it gets shorter and shorter at the
bottom here top there's more

978
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
bottom here top there's more
 

979
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,470
bottom here top there's more
vertical space so that's another option

980
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
vertical space so that's another option
 

981
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,149
vertical space so that's another option
i kind of like that one more

982
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
i kind of like that one more
 

983
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,590
i kind of like that one more
but i think that's better than the ones

984
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
but i think that's better than the ones
 

985
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,590
but i think that's better than the ones
in the wall

986
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
in the wall
 

987
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,990
in the wall
um oh check this out we got uh

988

um oh check this out we got uh
 

989
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,350
um oh check this out we got uh
yeah because we got so touch i guess

990
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
yeah because we got so touch i guess
 

991
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,990
yeah because we got so touch i guess
that glitches back into

992
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000

too bad uh
 

997
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,789
too bad uh
anyway that makes this part all lit up i

998
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
anyway that makes this part all lit up i
 

999
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,549
anyway that makes this part all lit up i
think we're all above

1000
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
think we're all above
 

1001
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,990
think we're all above
light level eight or higher here

1002
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
light level eight or higher here
 

1003
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,510
light level eight or higher here
we look good cool so that's another

1004
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
we look good cool so that's another
 

1005
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,789
we look good cool so that's another
thing done

1006
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
thing done
 

1007
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,990
thing done
uh this we might convert i was just

1008
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
uh this we might convert i was just
 

1009
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,430
uh this we might convert i was just
thinking of it now maybe we should

1010
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
thinking of it now maybe we should
 

1011
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,230
thinking of it now maybe we should
convert this

1012
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
convert this
 

1013
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,710
convert this
to an ender pearl station since we don't

1014
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
to an ender pearl station since we don't
 

1015

1279
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,630

1294
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
here they're not really necessary i
 

1295
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,669

1297
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,269
don't know if we should keep them or not
but i think that looks a lot better than

1298
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
but i think that looks a lot better than
 

1299
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,389
but i think that looks a lot better than
here and here

1300
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
here and here
 

1301
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,070
here and here
and the water doesn't wash them away i

1302
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080

1307
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,110
if we want to have item frames i think
that's a good spot for them

1308
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
that's a good spot for them
 

1309

1321
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,430

looks pretty good actually

1322
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440

1323
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,549

1325
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,549

pretty cool it does block the view a

1326
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
pretty cool it does block the view a
 

1327
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,990
pretty cool it does block the view a
little bit but i don't think it's too

1328
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
little bit but i don't think it's too
 

1329
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,190
little bit but i don't think it's too
bad

1330
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
bad
 

1331
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,950

1338
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
since this is gone we need more light in
 

1339
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,510

00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
this area so it's better than a torch
 

1341
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,710
this area so it's better than a torch
so i added that in and again it it

1342
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
so i added that in and again it it
 

1343
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,990
so i added that in and again it it

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,510
up here you can't quite see that bridge
there but when you get down lower it's

1348
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
there but when you get down lower it's
 

1349
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,269
