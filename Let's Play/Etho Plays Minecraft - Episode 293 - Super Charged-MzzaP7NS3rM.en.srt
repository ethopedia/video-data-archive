good overhangs going on I actually have

614
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:14,929
good overhangs going on I actually have
 

615
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,419
good overhangs going on I actually have
a lot of things like this in my world

616
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:16,429
a lot of things like this in my world
 

617
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,340

where there'll be a big mountain and
 

619
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,930
where there'll be a big mountain and
there'll be a big non-supported overhang

620

there'll be a big non-supported overhang
 

621
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,070
there'll be a big non-supported overhang
just sticking out the top so something

622
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,080
just sticking out the top so something
 

623
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,200

I'm noticing with these new biomes I

624
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,210
I'm noticing with these new biomes I
 

625
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,090
I'm noticing with these new biomes I
don't know if they changed or not but I

626
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,100
don't know if they changed or not but I
 

627
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,100
don't know if they changed or not but I
know before it was very difficult to

628
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,110
know before it was very difficult to
 

629
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,140
know before it was very difficult to
like find a spot where everywhere you

630
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,150
like find a spot where everywhere you
 

631
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,630
like find a spot where everywhere you
look was that one biome unless you were

632
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
look was that one biome unless you were
 

633
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,060
look was that one biome unless you were
playing with extra large biomes I almost

634
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,070
playing with extra large biomes I almost
 

635
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,230
playing with extra large biomes I almost
think either I'm finding really large

636
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,240
think either I'm finding really large
 

637
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,560
think either I'm finding really large
ones by chance here but I almost think

638
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:49,570
ones by chance here but I almost think
 

639
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,799
ones by chance here but I almost think
they're bigger than they used to be

640
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:52,809
they're bigger than they used to be
 

641
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,630
they're bigger than they used to be
because this is all this taiga take a

642
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:57,640
because this is all this taiga take a
 

643
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,200
because this is all this taiga take a
tango whatever biome it's all visible

644
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,210
tango whatever biome it's all visible
 

645
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,720
tango whatever biome it's all visible
from this one spot and it probably keeps

646
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:04,730
from this one spot and it probably keeps
 

647
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,039
from this one spot and it probably keeps
going aways too good there's no Enderman

648

663
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,260
see I don't even think I saw pictures of
this kind of swampland that's pretty

664
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,270
this kind of swampland that's pretty
 

665
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,380

swamp breeds looks like this is

668
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:46,549
swamp breeds looks like this is
 

669
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,510
swamp breeds looks like this is
different biomes bro they're different

670
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
different biomes bro they're different
 

671
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,320
different biomes bro they're different
colors anyway and then this looks like

672
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,330
colors anyway and then this looks like
 

673
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,499
colors anyway and then this looks like
the regular swamp up this way

674
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:57,509

 

675
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,749

I finally found a like a biome I wanted

678
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:03,940
I finally found a like a biome I wanted
 

679
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,810
I finally found a like a biome I wanted
to see this stuff here and it's so small

680
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:08,820
to see this stuff here and it's so small
 

681
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,619
to see this stuff here and it's so small
all right well let's keep looking

682

all right well let's keep looking
 

683
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:14,940
all right well let's keep looking
that's pretty neat the way these two

684
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:14,950
that's pretty neat the way these two
 

685
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:26,909
that's pretty neat the way these two
form going opposite of each other that's

686
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:26,919
form going opposite of each other that's
 

687
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,899
form going opposite of each other that's
cool mountain with a big hole through it

cool mountain with a big hole through it
right through the center let's go look

690
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:35,259
right through the center let's go look
 

691
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:37,980
right through the center let's go look
on the other side here there any mobs in

692
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:37,990
on the other side here there any mobs in
 

693
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,039
on the other side here there any mobs in
here no we're good

guessing I don't think they came out
 

711
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,889
guessing I don't think they came out
with any new saplings though like I'm

712
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:28,899
with any new saplings though like I'm
 

713
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,159
with any new saplings though like I'm
sure this is dropps okay there's no way

714
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,169
sure this is dropps okay there's no way
 

715
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:41,899
sure this is dropps okay there's no way
of planting these trees unfortunately

716
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:41,909

 

717
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:47,220

now or do we get oak sapling yeah what

718
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,230
now or do we get oak sapling yeah what
 

719
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,330
now or do we get oak sapling yeah what
are they they're they're two by two

720
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,340
are they they're they're two by two
 

721
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,859
are they they're they're two by two
unless there's two by two oak sapling

722
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:52,869
unless there's two by two oak sapling
 

723
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:57,169
unless there's two by two oak sapling
trees now

724
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:57,179

with the the terrain update I wasn't

826
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:53,609
with the the terrain update I wasn't
 

827
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,899
with the the terrain update I wasn't
quite ready to make that step yet cuz I

828
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:56,909
quite ready to make that step yet cuz I
 

829

went through about eight Plains biomes I

830
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:00,929
went through about eight Plains biomes I
 

831
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:04,700
went through about eight Plains biomes I
think after walking about 5000 blocks or

832
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:04,710
think after walking about 5000 blocks or
 

833
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,420
think after walking about 5000 blocks or
more

834
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,430
more

in that little adventure we did I didn't

836
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,130

837
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,130
in that little adventure we did I didn't
see a single horse which has me a little

838
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,140
see a single horse which has me a little
 

839
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,110
see a single horse which has me a little
worried I might have just been really

840
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
worried I might have just been really
 

841
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,310
worried I might have just been really
unlucky but from my experience every

842
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
unlucky but from my experience every
 

843
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,510

Plains before this usually has at least

844
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
Plains before this usually has at least
 

845
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,680
Plains before this usually has at least
one horse in but now to go through eight

846
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:25,690
one horse in but now to go through eight
 

847
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,350
one horse in but now to go through eight
and not find any makes me think either

848
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,360
and not find any makes me think either
 

849
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,510
and not find any makes me think either

851
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,330
they really lowered the rates on purpose
or there's some kind of bug there that I

852
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,340
or there's some kind of bug there that I
 

853
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,660
or there's some kind of bug there that I
should wait on here also like even

854
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:36,670

857
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,150
though we saw a lot of cool things I
found a lot of the terrain was pretty

858
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,160
found a lot of the terrain was pretty
 

859
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,940
found a lot of the terrain was pretty
flat so I'm considering doing that

860
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:44,950
flat so I'm considering doing that
 

861
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,360
flat so I'm considering doing that

it's because of the new generation that

920
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:17,380
it's because of the new generation that
 

921
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,659
it's because of the new generation that
came out

922
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:18,669
came out
 

923
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,190

929
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,759
that patch came out when that new
version came out wasn't just because of

930
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:29,769
version came out wasn't just because of
 

931
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:31,289
version came out wasn't just because of
the new terrain is because everything

932
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:31,299
the new terrain is because everything
 

933
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,340
the new terrain is because everything
was wrecked and I didn't want to spend

934

well with this update yes we have new
terrain generation but nothing's really

942
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:46,869
terrain generation but nothing's really
 

943
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:49,560
terrain generation but nothing's really
broken and I'm not really ready to say

944
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:49,570
broken and I'm not really ready to say

949
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,479

farther out if we want to build
 

951
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:58,950
farther out if we want to build
something where the new terrain

952
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
something where the new terrain
 

953
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,700
something where the new terrain
generation is we we definitely have that

954
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:02,710
generation is we we definitely have that
 

955
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,710
generation is we we definitely have that
option it's not even that far it's like
