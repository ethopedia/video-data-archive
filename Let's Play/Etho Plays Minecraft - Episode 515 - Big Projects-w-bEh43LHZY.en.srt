00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,300
think I'm colorblind blue green blue
purple so you see it's working pretty

162
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,310
purple so you see it's working pretty
 

163
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,750
purple so you see it's working pretty
good

164
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:27,760
good
 

165
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,390
good
got a nice little code generator here I

166
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
got a nice little code generator here I
 

167
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,940
got a nice little code generator here I
think using chakra boxes was a pretty

168
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:32,950
think using chakra boxes was a pretty
 

169
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,410
think using chakra boxes was a pretty
good idea look at that green green green

orange man three greens what are the
 

173
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,720
orange man three greens what are the
odds so it's really important when we do

174
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:42,730
odds so it's really important when we do
 

175
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,640
odds so it's really important when we do
this that all six colors are in the

176
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:44,650
this that all six colors are in the
 

177
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,370
this that all six colors are in the
dispensers here and that they don't jump

178
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,380
dispensers here and that they don't jump
 

179
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,440
dispensers here and that they don't jump
between dispensers they have to say stay

180
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,450
between dispensers they have to say stay
 

181
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,330
between dispensers they have to say stay
separate that's what we're using the

182
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,340
separate that's what we're using the
 

183
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,550
separate that's what we're using the
trapdoors for it to create a wall like

184
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:53,560
trapdoors for it to create a wall like
 

185
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,800
trapdoors for it to create a wall like
we looked into last episode Spencer here

186
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:57,810
we looked into last episode Spencer here
 

187
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,050
we looked into last episode Spencer here
you see all six were in here before it

188
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,060
you see all six were in here before it
 

189
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,320
you see all six were in here before it
shot out the one it shows so it's

190
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,330
shot out the one it shows so it's
 

191
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,440
shot out the one it shows so it's
choosing a totally random code which is

192
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,450
choosing a totally random code which is
 

193
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,250
choosing a totally random code which is
important aha so basically this goes up

194
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,260
important aha so basically this goes up
 

195
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,300
important aha so basically this goes up
to some Pistons over here this is part

196
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,310
to some Pistons over here this is part
 

197
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,550
to some Pistons over here this is part
of the shutter so at the start of the

198
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:17,560
of the shutter so at the start of the
 

199
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,020
of the shutter so at the start of the
game we're gonna move that button there

200
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,030
game we're gonna move that button there
 

201
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,660
game we're gonna move that button there
- probably the platform and we're gonna

202
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:21,670
- probably the platform and we're gonna
 

203
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,480
- probably the platform and we're gonna
press that to start the game and that's

204
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,490
press that to start the game and that's
 

205
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,900
press that to start the game and that's
going to first make some Pistons come

206
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:27,910
going to first make some Pistons come
 

207
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,360
going to first make some Pistons come
down you see it's closed right now

208
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,370
down you see it's closed right now
 

209
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,580
down you see it's closed right now
that'll close the shutter there so we

210
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,590
that'll close the shutter there so we
 

211
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,490
that'll close the shutter there so we
can't see what the code is right now is

212
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,500
can't see what the code is right now is
 

213
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,090
can't see what the code is right now is
these alternating oh you press it again

214
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,100
these alternating oh you press it again
 

215
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,350
these alternating oh you press it again
it'll be open so you can actually see

216
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:40,360
it'll be open so you can actually see
 

217
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,530
it'll be open so you can actually see
the code there so that closes at the

218
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:43,540
the code there so that closes at the
 

219
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,690
the code there so that closes at the
start of the game and then it also

220
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:45,700
start of the game and then it also
 

221
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,910
start of the game and then it also
activates this line of pistons which

222
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:47,920
activates this line of pistons which
 

223
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,870
activates this line of pistons which
breaks the chakra boxes those fall into

224
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:51,880
breaks the chakra boxes those fall into
 

225
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,090
breaks the chakra boxes those fall into
a hopper a set of hoppers that needs to

226
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,100
a hopper a set of hoppers that needs to
 

227
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,640
a hopper a set of hoppers that needs to
be unlocked so that sends power over

228
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:56,650
be unlocked so that sends power over
 

229
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,800
be unlocked so that sends power over
here to our hair and there's some

230
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:01,810
here to our hair and there's some
 

231
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,260
here to our hair and there's some
hoppers underneath uh-huh so it unlocks

232
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,270
hoppers underneath uh-huh so it unlocks
 

233
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,460
hoppers underneath uh-huh so it unlocks
the hoppers so they can pick up the

234
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,470
the hoppers so they can pick up the
 

235
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,740
the hoppers so they can pick up the
shelter boxes and then those go into the

236
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,750
shelter boxes and then those go into the
 

237
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,230
shelter boxes and then those go into the
dropper and then we also have to send

238
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
dropper and then we also have to send
 

239
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,140
dropper and then we also have to send
power to the line down here which makes

240
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,150
power to the line down here which makes
 

241
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,909
power to the line down here which makes
the chakra box to shoot from the dropper

242
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:14,919
the chakra box to shoot from the dropper
 

243
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,469
the chakra box to shoot from the dropper
up to the dispenser here and then we

244
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
up to the dispenser here and then we
 

245
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,629
up to the dispenser here and then we
activate another line

246
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
activate another line
 

247
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,469
activate another line
up here to shoot the chakra boxes out of

248
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
up here to shoot the chakra boxes out of
 

249
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,270
up here to shoot the chakra boxes out of
the dispenser to generate a new code so

250
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
the dispenser to generate a new code so
 

251
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,980
the dispenser to generate a new code so
there's actually a lot of stuff going on

252
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:25,990
there's actually a lot of stuff going on
 

253
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,489
there's actually a lot of stuff going on
with this this little bit over here

254
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:29,499
with this this little bit over here
 

255
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,379
with this this little bit over here
oh yeah and check this out I thought

256
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:31,389
oh yeah and check this out I thought
 

257
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,230
oh yeah and check this out I thought
this is kind of weird or interesting if

258
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
this is kind of weird or interesting if
 

259
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,670
this is kind of weird or interesting if
you have a trapdoor like this then you

260
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
you have a trapdoor like this then you
 

261
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,769
you have a trapdoor like this then you
go to open the chakra box it can't like

262
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:37,779
go to open the chakra box it can't like
 

263
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,899
go to open the chakra box it can't like
I'm right-clicking you can't open it

264
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:39,909
I'm right-clicking you can't open it
 

265
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,879
I'm right-clicking you can't open it
this is in the way which which makes

266
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:41,889
this is in the way which which makes
 

267
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,839
this is in the way which which makes
sense you flip it and then you can cuz

268
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:45,849
sense you flip it and then you can cuz
 

269
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,459
sense you flip it and then you can cuz
it's out of the ways that also makes

270
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:47,469
it's out of the ways that also makes
 

271
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,179
it's out of the ways that also makes
sense right

272
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:48,189
sense right
 

273
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,550
sense right
I thought that was kind of cool but like

274
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
I thought that was kind of cool but like
 

275
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,999
I thought that was kind of cool but like
not everything does that like if we have

276
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:54,009
not everything does that like if we have
 

277
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,709
not everything does that like if we have
sand on a trapdoor like then when you

278
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:55,719
sand on a trapdoor like then when you
 

279
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:58,350
sand on a trapdoor like then when you
flip it down it doesn't fall even if you

280
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
flip it down it doesn't fall even if you
 

281
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,790
flip it down it doesn't fall even if you
update it right I don't know I thought

282
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
update it right I don't know I thought
 

283
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
update it right I don't know I thought
that was kind of kind of weird kind of

284
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:04,810
that was kind of kind of weird kind of
 

285
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,390
that was kind of kind of weird kind of
cool anyways this does one other thing

286
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
cool anyways this does one other thing
 

287
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,429
cool anyways this does one other thing
but wait there's more if you order now

288
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:11,439
but wait there's more if you order now
 

289
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,719
but wait there's more if you order now
now so we have one extra function here

290
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:15,729
now so we have one extra function here
 

291
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,700
now so we have one extra function here
we want to be able to store items in the

292
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:17,710
we want to be able to store items in the
 

293
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,170
we want to be able to store items in the
chakra boxes these are gonna have the

294
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,180
chakra boxes these are gonna have the
 

295
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,600
chakra boxes these are gonna have the
concrete powder in so the yellow chakra

296
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:21,610
concrete powder in so the yellow chakra
 

297
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,159

in our game we want to refresh the code

310
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:40,629
in our game we want to refresh the code
 

311
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,219

down downstairs at the ice there so that

312
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:44,229
down downstairs at the ice there so that
 

313
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,019
down downstairs at the ice there so that
it doesn't despawn on us because we were

314
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:46,029
it doesn't despawn on us because we were
 

315
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,450
it doesn't despawn on us because we were
worried about that if we press this

316
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,460
worried about that if we press this
 

317
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,869
worried about that if we press this
button it allows one item to flow from

318
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:51,879
button it allows one item to flow from
 

319

the sand through the floor using a
 

479
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,569
the sand through the floor using a
redstone device and this is the device

480
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:01,579
redstone device and this is the device
 

481
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,660
redstone device and this is the device
here okay so we got some double

482
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:04,670
here okay so we got some double
 

483
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,329
here okay so we got some double
extenders there which can reach the

484
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:07,339
extenders there which can reach the
 

485
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,449
extenders there which can reach the
block up to here and it's kind of a

486
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:10,459
block up to here and it's kind of a
 

487
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,920
block up to here and it's kind of a
weird thing so let's just see it working

488
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:11,930
weird thing so let's just see it working
 

489
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,360
weird thing so let's just see it working
here press it once it does that the

490
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,370
here press it once it does that the
 

491
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,889
here press it once it does that the
floor is not back in place press it

492
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:17,899
floor is not back in place press it
 

493
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,350
floor is not back in place press it
again it does that uh-huh but we still

494
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
again it does that uh-huh but we still
 

495
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,999
again it does that uh-huh but we still
got to do a little bit more with it cuz

496
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:25,009
got to do a little bit more with it cuz
 

497
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,889
got to do a little bit more with it cuz
after we drop the concrete powder down

498
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:26,899
after we drop the concrete powder down
 

499
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,069
after we drop the concrete powder down
here we got to break it into items and

500
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
here we got to break it into items and
 

501
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,540
here we got to break it into items and
then like collect it together in a

502
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,550
then like collect it together in a
 

503
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,540
then like collect it together in a
Chester or some storage that we can

504
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:34,550
Chester or some storage that we can
 

505
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,369
Chester or some storage that we can
access easy so we'll probably just drop

506
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:36,379
access easy so we'll probably just drop
 

507
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,710
access easy so we'll probably just drop
it on some slabs

508
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:37,720
it on some slabs
 

509
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,629
it on some slabs
if you drop concrete powder or sand on

510
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:40,639
if you drop concrete powder or sand on
 

511
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,730
if you drop concrete powder or sand on
slabs it breaks alright

512
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:42,740
slabs it breaks alright
 

513
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,280
slabs it breaks alright
but then after after we do that we have

514
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,290
but then after after we do that we have
 

515
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,869
but then after after we do that we have
to decide like do we want to use water

516
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:46,879
to decide like do we want to use water
 

517
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,230
to decide like do we want to use water
streams collect together hopper chains

518
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
streams collect together hopper chains
 

519
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,170
streams collect together hopper chains
we could use like a hopper minecart to

520
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,180
we could use like a hopper minecart to
 

521
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,819
we could use like a hopper minecart to
run underneath the slabs and pick them

522
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:54,829
run underneath the slabs and pick them
 

523
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,280
run underneath the slabs and pick them
up so I was just kind of thinking about

524
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,290
up so I was just kind of thinking about
 

525
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,309
up so I was just kind of thinking about
that if we wanted to use water streams

526
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:00,319
that if we wanted to use water streams
 

527
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,879
that if we wanted to use water streams
we could probably do something like this

528
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:03,889
we could probably do something like this
 

529
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,280
we could probably do something like this
we got the slabs here with the water in

530
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,290
we got the slabs here with the water in
 

531
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,710
we got the slabs here with the water in
now do you guys know possibly a new game

532
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
now do you guys know possibly a new game
 

533
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,960
now do you guys know possibly a new game
mechanic you haven't looked at if you

534
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:10,970
mechanic you haven't looked at if you
 

535
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,819
mechanic you haven't looked at if you
drop concrete powder on on a slab here

536
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:15,829
drop concrete powder on on a slab here
 

537
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,189
drop concrete powder on on a slab here
with water does it turn into solid

538
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:18,199
with water does it turn into solid
 

539
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,100
with water does it turn into solid
concrete's it doesn't spoiler but if

540
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,110
concrete's it doesn't spoiler but if
 

541
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,519
concrete's it doesn't spoiler but if
that slab wasn't there BAM solid

542
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:27,529
that slab wasn't there BAM solid
 

543
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,949
that slab wasn't there BAM solid
concrete just like that so this idea

544
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:29,959
concrete just like that so this idea
 

545
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,189
concrete just like that so this idea
would work but my concern with doing

546
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:33,199
would work but my concern with doing
 

547
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,410
would work but my concern with doing
this is you have the water sound playing

548
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,420
this is you have the water sound playing
 

549
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,110
this is you have the water sound playing
constantly and that could get a little

550
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,120
constantly and that could get a little
 

551
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,850
constantly and that could get a little
bit annoying so I kind I don't really

552
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:39,860
bit annoying so I kind I don't really
 

553
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,439
bit annoying so I kind I don't really
want to do that plus the whole mixing

554
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:41,449
want to do that plus the whole mixing
 

555
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,170
want to do that plus the whole mixing
water with redstone projects is never a

556
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,180
water with redstone projects is never a
 

557
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,559
water with redstone projects is never a
good idea so we'll probably go for a

558
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:46,569
good idea so we'll probably go for a
 

559
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,670
good idea so we'll probably go for a
hopper minecart that runs underneath

560
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,680
hopper minecart that runs underneath
 

561
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,499
hopper minecart that runs underneath
here and then hopefully takes all the

562
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:50,509
here and then hopefully takes all the
 

563
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:54,309
here and then hopefully takes all the
concrete powder and delivers it to our

564
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:54,319
concrete powder and delivers it to our
 

565
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:57,910
concrete powder and delivers it to our
starting platform here so after after we

566
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
starting platform here so after after we
 

567
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,060
starting platform here so after after we
again it collects all our play pieces

568
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,070
again it collects all our play pieces
 

569
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,360
again it collects all our play pieces
and brings them back to us up here is

570
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,370
and brings them back to us up here is
 

571
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,060
and brings them back to us up here is
the plan all right so let's check this

572
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,070
the plan all right so let's check this
 

573
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,350
the plan all right so let's check this
out one more time make sure it breaks I

574
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,360
out one more time make sure it breaks I
 

575
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,350
out one more time make sure it breaks I
am just like that all right that's good

576
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
am just like that all right that's good
 

577
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,629
am just like that all right that's good
by the way with this I had a little bit

578
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
by the way with this I had a little bit
 

579
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,170
by the way with this I had a little bit
of a problem trying to get everything to

580
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,180
of a problem trying to get everything to
 

581
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,870
of a problem trying to get everything to
fit you'll notice like the stuff we

582
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
fit you'll notice like the stuff we
 

583
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,389
fit you'll notice like the stuff we
built before is like right over here and

584
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,399
built before is like right over here and
 

585
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,699
built before is like right over here and
we have to make sure the redstone from

586
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:27,709
we have to make sure the redstone from
 

587
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,699
we have to make sure the redstone from
that doesn't interfere with our double

588
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:30,709
that doesn't interfere with our double
 

589
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,920
that doesn't interfere with our double
extender thing here and I found

590
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:32,930
extender thing here and I found
 

591
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,900
extender thing here and I found
something out kind of interesting while

592
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:34,910
something out kind of interesting while
 

593
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,420
something out kind of interesting while
doing this that I didn't realize this is

594
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,430
doing this that I didn't realize this is
 

595
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,930
doing this that I didn't realize this is
kind of a trick you can with do with the

596
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:39,940
kind of a trick you can with do with the
 

597
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,910
kind of a trick you can with do with the
double extenders you have one observer

598
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:42,920
double extenders you have one observer
 

599
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,600
double extenders you have one observer
facing down at this piston and basically

600
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,610
facing down at this piston and basically
 

601
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,310
facing down at this piston and basically
when this piston extends the observer

602
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,320
when this piston extends the observer
 

603
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,110
when this piston extends the observer
detects that and then this observer

604
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
detects that and then this observer
 

605
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,210
detects that and then this observer
detects that this observer detected that

606
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,220
detects that this observer detected that
 

607
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,850
detects that this observer detected that
it powers this block so when this piston

608
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:57,860
it powers this block so when this piston
 

609
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,730
it powers this block so when this piston
is here it gets power at the right time

610
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:00,740
is here it gets power at the right time
 

611
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,699
is here it gets power at the right time
to extend even further that way you

612
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:03,709
to extend even further that way you
 

613
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,069
to extend even further that way you
don't need like a timing device to you

614
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
don't need like a timing device to you
 

615
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,230
don't need like a timing device to you
know figure out when to activate the

616
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
know figure out when to activate the
 

617
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,660
know figure out when to activate the
second piston kind of does it all on its

618
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,670
second piston kind of does it all on its
 

619
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,519
second piston kind of does it all on its
own the thing I found out about this

620
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:12,529
own the thing I found out about this
 

621
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,280
own the thing I found out about this
though after I had it all designed and

622
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,290
though after I had it all designed and
 

623
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,030
though after I had it all designed and
figured out apparently if you have a

624
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,040
figured out apparently if you have a
 

625
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,460
figured out apparently if you have a
block above that a block above a piston

626
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,470
block above that a block above a piston
 

627
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,190
block above that a block above a piston
it gets in an infinite loop like this

628
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,200

 

629
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,110

uh-huh so I had to redesign the whole

630
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
uh-huh so I had to redesign the whole
 

631
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,160
uh-huh so I had to redesign the whole
thing but that block is gone it's fine

632
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,170
thing but that block is gone it's fine
 

633
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,579
thing but that block is gone it's fine
kind of an interesting mechanic so I

634
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:40,589
kind of an interesting mechanic so I
 

635
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,259
kind of an interesting mechanic so I
thought we would hop over to the ice

636
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:42,269
thought we would hop over to the ice
 

637
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:44,660
thought we would hop over to the ice
farm here as well today guys I've been

638
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:44,670
farm here as well today guys I've been
 

639
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,490
farm here as well today guys I've been
working on this little by little between

640
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:46,500
working on this little by little between
 

641
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,889
working on this little by little between
episodes and it's kind of at the point

642
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:48,899
episodes and it's kind of at the point
 

643
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,530
episodes and it's kind of at the point
now where it's basically fully

644
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,540
now where it's basically fully
 

645
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,090
now where it's basically fully
functional it's just missing like a

646
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,100
functional it's just missing like a
 

647
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,310
functional it's just missing like a
collection system and a couple other

648
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,320
collection system and a couple other
 

649
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,710
collection system and a couple other
niceties or would be cool to add on to

650
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
niceties or would be cool to add on to
 

651
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,060
niceties or would be cool to add on to
this thought we would do that together

652
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,070
this thought we would do that together
 

653
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,360
this thought we would do that together
here don't get it though isn't it

654
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,370
here don't get it though isn't it
 

655
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,710
here don't get it though isn't it
beautiful oh my baby my my own creation

656
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
beautiful oh my baby my my own creation
 

657
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
beautiful oh my baby my my own creation
here like if I if I made an art project

658
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,490
here like if I if I made an art project
 

659
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,629
here like if I if I made an art project
this is what it would look like mm-hmm

660
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:11,639
this is what it would look like mm-hmm
 

661
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,750
this is what it would look like mm-hmm
that regular geometry beautiful the

662
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,760
that regular geometry beautiful the
 

663
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,810
that regular geometry beautiful the
perfect rectangles kind of looks like a

664
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:17,820
perfect rectangles kind of looks like a
 

665
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,000
perfect rectangles kind of looks like a
welcome mat maybe you know you know that

666
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,010
welcome mat maybe you know you know that
 

667
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,939
welcome mat maybe you know you know that
you wipe your feet on look that's what

668
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:22,949
you wipe your feet on look that's what
 

669
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,620
you wipe your feet on look that's what
it reminds me of or maybe some tire

670
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:24,630
it reminds me of or maybe some tire
 

671
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,470
it reminds me of or maybe some tire
tread I don't know

672
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
tread I don't know
 

673
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,889
tread I don't know
I'm quite the artist though aha so yeah

674
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:30,899
I'm quite the artist though aha so yeah
 

675
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,269
I'm quite the artist though aha so yeah
this is pretty much fully functional

676
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:32,279
this is pretty much fully functional
 

677
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,670
this is pretty much fully functional
just to show you again how it's gonna

678
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,680
just to show you again how it's gonna
 

679
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,420
just to show you again how it's gonna
work you basically here make your way

680
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,430
work you basically here make your way
 

681
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,490
work you basically here make your way
down and then when you get to the end of

682
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:43,500
down and then when you get to the end of
 

683
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,319
down and then when you get to the end of
it step on my pressure plate and

684
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:45,329
it step on my pressure plate and
 

685
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:50,360
it step on my pressure plate and
actually all the suspension there's

686
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,370
actually all the suspension there's
 

687
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,250
actually all the suspension there's
water hidden in here and welcome which

688
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,260
water hidden in here and welcome which
 

689
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,540
water hidden in here and welcome which
is ice on the edge of the leg

690
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:56,550

 

691
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,690

we're watching right now and see though

692
00:15:59,690 --> 00:15:59,700
we're watching right now and see though
 

693
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,670
we're watching right now and see though
it's pretty good it takes a long time to

694
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
it's pretty good it takes a long time to
 

695
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,180
it's pretty good it takes a long time to
get down to them and here we stepped on

696
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,190
get down to them and here we stepped on
 

697
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,280
get down to them and here we stepped on
the pressure plate here and that

698
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,290
the pressure plate here and that
 

699
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,790
the pressure plate here and that
refilled it so now all the water is

700
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
refilled it so now all the water is
 

701
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,280
refilled it so now all the water is
going to start freezing to ice again so

702
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,290
going to start freezing to ice again so
 

703
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,680
going to start freezing to ice again so
this is all salted water which it's

704
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:15,690
this is all salted water which it's
 

705
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,180
this is all salted water which it's
pretty cool um let's go check this out

706
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,190
pretty cool um let's go check this out
 

707
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,040
pretty cool um let's go check this out
so right now this is what's happening

708
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,050
so right now this is what's happening
 

709
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,020
so right now this is what's happening
it's the ice it falls off the the ledge

710
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,030
it's the ice it falls off the the ledge
 

711
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,870
it's the ice it falls off the the ledge
here and it's just sitting here so we

712
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
here and it's just sitting here so we
 

713
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
here and it's just sitting here so we
either need to like put water stream

714
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,370
either need to like put water stream
 

715
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,440
either need to like put water stream
here I'm thinking to push it all towards

716
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,450
here I'm thinking to push it all towards
 

717
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,600
here I'm thinking to push it all towards
one one side of our ice farm and then

718
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:35,610
one one side of our ice farm and then
 

719
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,990
one one side of our ice farm and then
collect it together in a chest or

720
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
collect it together in a chest or
 

721
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,040
collect it together in a chest or
another idea oh oh I got a few on me

722
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,050
another idea oh oh I got a few on me
 

723
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,270
another idea oh oh I got a few on me
here my other idea is maybe like we

724
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,280
here my other idea is maybe like we
 

725
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,070
here my other idea is maybe like we
could try to make this into an afk ice

726
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,080
could try to make this into an afk ice
 

727
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,920
could try to make this into an afk ice
farm is an option but honestly I don't

728
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:51,930
farm is an option but honestly I don't
 

729
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,460
farm is an option but honestly I don't
really use any afk features of the farms

730
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,470
really use any afk features of the farms
 

731
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,560
really use any afk features of the farms
I build I don't like to just leave my

732
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:57,570
I build I don't like to just leave my
 

733
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,330
I build I don't like to just leave my
computer running with Minecraft on I

734
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,340
computer running with Minecraft on I
 

735
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,150
computer running with Minecraft on I
usually just like to to get something

736
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
usually just like to to get something
 

737
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,940
usually just like to to get something
quickly and actively and actually play

738
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:04,950
quickly and actively and actually play
 

739
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,970
quickly and actively and actually play
the game to get stuff you know so if I

740
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:07,980
the game to get stuff you know so if I
 

741
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,160
the game to get stuff you know so if I
did make this an afk farm like we could

742
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,170
did make this an afk farm like we could
 

743
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,310
did make this an afk farm like we could
do that just have the water screen here

744
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,320
do that just have the water screen here
 

745
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,900
do that just have the water screen here
pushing us along as we break the ice

746
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:14,910
pushing us along as we break the ice
 

747
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,150
pushing us along as we break the ice
kind of slowly going along that's one

748
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
kind of slowly going along that's one
 

749
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,310
kind of slowly going along that's one
option but I think we'll just put the

750
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,320
option but I think we'll just put the
 

751
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,630
option but I think we'll just put the
water streams down lower here and I'm

752
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
water streams down lower here and I'm
 

753
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,350
water streams down lower here and I'm
hoping like the ice will be able to fall

754
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,360
hoping like the ice will be able to fall
 

755
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,220
hoping like the ice will be able to fall
between the crack here with the glass

756
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,230
between the crack here with the glass
 

757
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,090
between the crack here with the glass
into the stream below here although if

758
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,100
into the stream below here although if
 

759
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,850
into the stream below here although if
we do this I'm just realizing now it's

760
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:40,860
we do this I'm just realizing now it's
 

761
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,840
we do this I'm just realizing now it's
probably gonna fall on that ledge oh

762
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:43,850
probably gonna fall on that ledge oh
 

763
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,010
probably gonna fall on that ledge oh
it's not gonna float like it might land

764
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,020
it's not gonna float like it might land
 

765
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,950
it's not gonna float like it might land
over there and I think if we use like

766
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
over there and I think if we use like
 

767
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,890
over there and I think if we use like
stairs or something this the glass will

768
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:54,900
stairs or something this the glass will
 

769
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,650
stairs or something this the glass will
connect to that right so I'll have to

770
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,660
connect to that right so I'll have to
 

771
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,540
connect to that right so I'll have to
think about this a little bit I'm sure

772
00:17:59,540 --> 00:17:59,550
think about this a little bit I'm sure
 

773
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,420
think about this a little bit I'm sure
there's a way though yeah so there's

774
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,430
there's a way though yeah so there's
 

775
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,920
there's a way though yeah so there's
actually probably quite a few things we

776
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,930
actually probably quite a few things we
 

777
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,830
actually probably quite a few things we
could use to do this we can't use stairs

778
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:06,840
could use to do this we can't use stairs
 

779
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,020
could use to do this we can't use stairs
though look at this glass panes connect

780
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,030
though look at this glass panes connect
 

781
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,190
though look at this glass panes connect
the stairs

782
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,200
the stairs
 

783
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,220
the stairs
that was changed a while ago before they

784
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,230
that was changed a while ago before they
 

785
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,470
that was changed a while ago before they
didn't but now now they do but we could

786
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,480
didn't but now now they do but we could
 

787
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,960
didn't but now now they do but we could
use like trapdoors you get a flat flat

788
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:17,970
use like trapdoors you get a flat flat
 

789
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,660
use like trapdoors you get a flat flat
area here it doesn't connect or even ice

790
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:20,670
area here it doesn't connect or even ice
 

791
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,430
area here it doesn't connect or even ice
or probably glass and that kind of stuff

792
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
or probably glass and that kind of stuff
 

793
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,900
or probably glass and that kind of stuff
would work too I think we're gonna go

794
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:23,910
would work too I think we're gonna go
 

795
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,780
would work too I think we're gonna go
for ice and we'll just do a small test

796
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:26,790
for ice and we'll just do a small test
 

797
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,200
for ice and we'll just do a small test
here to see how well it works I think I

798
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,210
here to see how well it works I think I
 

799
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,410
here to see how well it works I think I
set it up over here yeah so the point of

800
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:33,420
set it up over here yeah so the point of
 

801
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,330
set it up over here yeah so the point of
putting the water stream down lower is

802
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
putting the water stream down lower is
 

803
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,950
putting the water stream down lower is
so that I don't have to walk through it

804
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
so that I don't have to walk through it
 

805
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,450
so that I don't have to walk through it
while harvesting ice because if I gotta

806
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,460
while harvesting ice because if I gotta
 

807
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,210
while harvesting ice because if I gotta
walk through it that water is gonna be

808
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,220
walk through it that water is gonna be
 

809
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,470
walk through it that water is gonna be
pushing me and it kind of slows you down

810
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
pushing me and it kind of slows you down
 

811
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,350
pushing me and it kind of slows you down
a little bit especially if we don't have

812
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
a little bit especially if we don't have
 

813
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,970
a little bit especially if we don't have
depth Strider on then we can't even use

814
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:46,980
depth Strider on then we can't even use
 

815
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,580
depth Strider on then we can't even use
the farm this is this is now fast we

816
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:49,590
the farm this is this is now fast we
 

817
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,800
the farm this is this is now fast we
move through it then so I kind of want

818
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:51,810
move through it then so I kind of want
 

819
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,260
move through it then so I kind of want
it lower so it's not a it's not a factor

820
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,270
it lower so it's not a it's not a factor
 

821
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,610
it lower so it's not a it's not a factor
it's not an annoying thing we have to

822
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:55,620
it's not an annoying thing we have to
 

823
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,080
it's not an annoying thing we have to
deal with as we're using the farm

824
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,090
deal with as we're using the farm
 

825
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,550
deal with as we're using the farm
so as this harvest one section here and

826
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:01,560
so as this harvest one section here and
 

827
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,020
so as this harvest one section here and
see how much of the ice actually falls

828
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,030
see how much of the ice actually falls
 

829
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,300
see how much of the ice actually falls
down here and kind of see how it groups

830
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,310
down here and kind of see how it groups
 

831
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,950
down here and kind of see how it groups
together like if we can just get away

832
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
together like if we can just get away
 

833
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,170
together like if we can just get away
with having one water stream kind of in

834
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:09,180
with having one water stream kind of in
 

835
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:20,270
with having one water stream kind of in
the middle here would be ideal looks

836
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,280
the middle here would be ideal looks
 

837
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,980
the middle here would be ideal looks
like most of it fell down there is a

838
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:21,990
like most of it fell down there is a
 

839
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,320
like most of it fell down there is a
little bit let that landed on it here

840
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,330
little bit let that landed on it here
 

841
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,440
little bit let that landed on it here
though and actually none of it landed on

842
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,450
though and actually none of it landed on
 

843
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,540
though and actually none of it landed on
the ledge but we're safer got to put the

844
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,550
the ledge but we're safer got to put the
 

845
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,330
the ledge but we're safer got to put the
ice here that's the idea we're gonna

846
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,340
ice here that's the idea we're gonna
 

847
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,270
ice here that's the idea we're gonna
fill that in okay we're gonna do a

848
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
fill that in okay we're gonna do a
 

849
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,010
fill that in okay we're gonna do a
little bit of a bigger cast here so I'm

850
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,020
little bit of a bigger cast here so I'm
 

851
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,070
little bit of a bigger cast here so I'm
going all the way down just to be a

852
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
going all the way down just to be a
 

853
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,390
going all the way down just to be a
little bit more certain where we're

854
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
little bit more certain where we're
 

855
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,080
little bit more certain where we're
going to be

856
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,090
going to be
 

857
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,280
going to be
I don't want to settle on something and

858
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,290
I don't want to settle on something and
 

859
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:52,130
I don't want to settle on something and
then find out it doesn't work so looks

860
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,140
then find out it doesn't work so looks
 

861
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,770
then find out it doesn't work so looks
like most of the ice does fall down some

862
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:54,780
like most of the ice does fall down some
 

863
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,480
like most of the ice does fall down some
land it here let's see how much ice we

864
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,490
land it here let's see how much ice we
 

865
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,070
land it here let's see how much ice we
pick up or at 57 we got two pieces two

866
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,080
pick up or at 57 we got two pieces two
 

867
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,450
pick up or at 57 we got two pieces two
pieces landed there the rest of it looks

868
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:05,460
pieces landed there the rest of it looks
 

869
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,190
pieces landed there the rest of it looks
like it fell down Oh a little bit more

870
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
like it fell down Oh a little bit more
 

871
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,580
like it fell down Oh a little bit more
here grouped up 57 64 who has actually a

872
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:13,590
here grouped up 57 64 who has actually a
 

873
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,610
here grouped up 57 64 who has actually a
big chunk there we got we got 18 hmm

874
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:18,620
big chunk there we got we got 18 hmm
 

875
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,050
big chunk there we got we got 18 hmm
yeah maybe it's a bad idea to do it this

876
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,060
yeah maybe it's a bad idea to do it this
 

877
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,420
yeah maybe it's a bad idea to do it this
way cuz if we if we have the water at

878
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,430
way cuz if we if we have the water at
 

879
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,620
way cuz if we if we have the water at
this level we don't have to worry about

880
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:24,630
this level we don't have to worry about
 

881
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,650
this level we don't have to worry about
that oh yeah there was something I

882
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:27,660
that oh yeah there was something I
 

883
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,150
that oh yeah there was something I
really wanted to mention about the ice

884
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,160
really wanted to mention about the ice
 

885
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,920
really wanted to mention about the ice
firm here there was there was an

886
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:30,930
firm here there was there was an
 

887
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,350
firm here there was there was an
interesting suggestion in the comments

888
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
interesting suggestion in the comments
 

889
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,500
interesting suggestion in the comments
that I tried out we're using the

890
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:36,510
that I tried out we're using the
 

891
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,360
that I tried out we're using the
dispensers in the farm like I've said

892
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,370
dispensers in the farm like I've said
 

893
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,250
dispensers in the farm like I've said
many times so that we can have ice

894
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,260
many times so that we can have ice
 

895
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,130
many times so that we can have ice
freezing on both sides so it starts on

896
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,140
freezing on both sides so it starts on
 

897
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,500
freezing on both sides so it starts on
the side with the trapdoors and it

898
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,510
the side with the trapdoors and it
 

899
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,090
the side with the trapdoors and it
starts on the side with the dispensers

900
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,100
starts on the side with the dispensers
 

901
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,040
starts on the side with the dispensers
instead of just like starting on one

902
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,050
instead of just like starting on one
 

903
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,530
instead of just like starting on one
side and slowly making its way to the

904
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:51,540
side and slowly making its way to the
 

905
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,840
side and slowly making its way to the
other it freezes like almost twice as

906
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:53,850
other it freezes like almost twice as
 

907
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,820
other it freezes like almost twice as
quick doing it with the dispensers here

908
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:55,830
quick doing it with the dispensers here
 

909
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,370
quick doing it with the dispensers here
the downside is we have to have all this

910
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,380
the downside is we have to have all this
 

911
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,160
the downside is we have to have all this
redstone to control it but you guys

912
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,170
redstone to control it but you guys
 

913
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,780
redstone to control it but you guys
suggested why not get rid of the

914
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:02,790
suggested why not get rid of the
 

915
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,110
suggested why not get rid of the
dispensers use the new water lodging

916
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,120
dispensers use the new water lodging
 

917
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,500
dispensers use the new water lodging
feature and just have slabs running all

918
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,510
feature and just have slabs running all
 

919
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,320
feature and just have slabs running all
along the side they're full of water

920
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,330
along the side they're full of water
 

921
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,040
along the side they're full of water
right that way water the water can still

922
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,050
right that way water the water can still
 

923
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,530
right that way water the water can still
freeze on the side but you don't need to

924
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:18,540
freeze on the side but you don't need to
 

925
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,090
freeze on the side but you don't need to
have any redstone controls or do

926
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,100
have any redstone controls or do
 

927
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,830
have any redstone controls or do
anything complicated or spend all the

928
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
anything complicated or spend all the
 

929
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,050
anything complicated or spend all the
the redstone and iron and all the

930
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,060
the redstone and iron and all the
 

931
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,900
the redstone and iron and all the
resources to do this right there's a

932
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:26,910
resources to do this right there's a
 

933
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,350
resources to do this right there's a
great idea I tried it out though and

934
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
great idea I tried it out though and
 

935
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,050
great idea I tried it out though and
interesting game mechanics again does it

936
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,060
interesting game mechanics again does it
 

937
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,390
interesting game mechanics again does it
work like I thought it would or you guys

938
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:35,400
work like I thought it would or you guys
 

939
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,150
work like I thought it would or you guys
thought it would if you have waterlogged

940
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,160
thought it would if you have waterlogged
 

941
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,010
thought it would if you have waterlogged
slabs like something like this this

942
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,020
slabs like something like this this
 

943
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,810
slabs like something like this this
water block in the middle will never

944
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:44,820
water block in the middle will never
 

945
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,610
water block in the middle will never
freeze even though it's in a cold biome

946
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:46,620
freeze even though it's in a cold biome
 

947
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,270
freeze even though it's in a cold biome
and it's got the slabs beside it's in

948
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,280
and it's got the slabs beside it's in
 

949
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,340
and it's got the slabs beside it's in
order to get ice you can't have water

950
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,350
order to get ice you can't have water
 

951
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,350
order to get ice you can't have water
blocks next to the water block you're

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,360
blocks next to the water block you're
 

953
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,760
blocks next to the water block you're
trying to freeze

954
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:55,770
trying to freeze
 

955
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,610
trying to freeze
and apparently the game sees these water

956
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:58,620
and apparently the game sees these water
 

957
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,799
and apparently the game sees these water
log slabs as water blocks they never

958
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:00,809
log slabs as water blocks they never
 

959
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,419
log slabs as water blocks they never
they can't see dice as long as we leave

960
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:05,429
they can't see dice as long as we leave
 

961
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,610
they can't see dice as long as we leave
us it'll never happen so I thought that

962
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:07,620
us it'll never happen so I thought that
 

963
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,870
us it'll never happen so I thought that
is kind of interesting because as we saw

964
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
is kind of interesting because as we saw
 

965
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,220
is kind of interesting because as we saw
with the concrete powder there

966
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,230
with the concrete powder there
 

967
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,130
with the concrete powder there
if you drop concrete powder into a water

968
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,140
if you drop concrete powder into a water
 

969
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,919
if you drop concrete powder into a water
log slab it has to make a decision like

970
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:15,929
log slab it has to make a decision like
 

971
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,220
log slab it has to make a decision like
does it turn it to concrete's or does it

972
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,230
does it turn it to concrete's or does it
 

973
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,620
does it turn it to concrete's or does it
break it asked the decides because it's

974
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:21,630
break it asked the decides because it's
 

975
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,389
break it asked the decides because it's
it's a block that has the two functions

976
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:23,399
it's a block that has the two functions
 

977
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:25,789
it's a block that has the two functions
right has to choose which function to do

978
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:25,799
right has to choose which function to do
 

979
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,039
right has to choose which function to do
and in that case it chooses the slab it

980
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:28,049
and in that case it chooses the slab it
 

981
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,289
and in that case it chooses the slab it
breaks the concrete powder in this case

982
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:30,299
breaks the concrete powder in this case
 

983
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,399
breaks the concrete powder in this case
it chooses the water and it doesn't it

984
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:34,409
it chooses the water and it doesn't it
 

985
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:36,950
it chooses the water and it doesn't it
doesn't freeze here while if this was

986
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
doesn't freeze here while if this was
 

987
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,659
doesn't freeze here while if this was
just a slab like if that was there then

988
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:38,669
just a slab like if that was there then
 

989
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,460
just a slab like if that was there then
this could freeze but if the water's

990
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,470
this could freeze but if the water's
 

991
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,010
this could freeze but if the water's
there can't oh yeah there's one more

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,020
there can't oh yeah there's one more

little detail about this farm I don't

994
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
little detail about this farm I don't
 

995
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,090
little detail about this farm I don't
think I mentioned before the reason why

996
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100
think I mentioned before the reason why
 

997
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,460
think I mentioned before the reason why
it's on a zigzagging pattern you notice

998
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,470
it's on a zigzagging pattern you notice
 

999
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,850
it's on a zigzagging pattern you notice
that it's not like perfectly in sync

1000
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:52,860
that it's not like perfectly in sync
 

1001
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,279
that it's not like perfectly in sync
with each other there's a reason for

1002
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,289
with each other there's a reason for
 

1003
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,519
with each other there's a reason for
that actually the idea is when we get to

1004
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:58,529
that actually the idea is when we get to
 

1005
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:00,980
that actually the idea is when we get to
the end of one of these chains like for

1006
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:00,990
the end of one of these chains like for
 

1007
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,200
the end of one of these chains like for
this one we'll be walking this way when

1008
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,210
this one we'll be walking this way when
 

1009
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,460
this one we'll be walking this way when
we get to the end here we step on the

1010
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,470
we get to the end here we step on the
 

1011
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,860
we get to the end here we step on the
pressure plates they'll probably be a

1012
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:06,870
pressure plates they'll probably be a
 

1013
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,010
pressure plates they'll probably be a
block here stop us from walking any

1014
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,020
block here stop us from walking any
 

1015
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,919
block here stop us from walking any
further to the left but then we got a

1016
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:12,929
further to the left but then we got a
 

1017
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,659
further to the left but then we got a
change directions here we got to go

1018
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:14,669
change directions here we got to go
 

1019
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,240
change directions here we got to go
forward to the next section we don't

1020
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,250
forward to the next section we don't
 

1021
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,340
forward to the next section we don't
ever want to move our mouse cursor while

1022
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,350
ever want to move our mouse cursor while
 

1023
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,769
ever want to move our mouse cursor while
using this farm so we move forward and

1024
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:21,779
using this farm so we move forward and
 

1025
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,630
using this farm so we move forward and
then we start walking right and that's

1026
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:23,640
then we start walking right and that's
 

1027
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,690
then we start walking right and that's
how we get to the next section you get

1028
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:26,700
how we get to the next section you get
 

1029
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,360
how we get to the next section you get
it so we walk left forward and then walk

1030
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,370
it so we walk left forward and then walk
 

1031
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,240
it so we walk left forward and then walk
right now there's a little extra device

1032
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,250
right now there's a little extra device
 

1033
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,159
right now there's a little extra device
I would like to add to this farm and as

1034
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,169
I would like to add to this farm and as
 

1035
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:37,210
I would like to add to this farm and as
this experimenting with it here we're

1036
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,220
this experimenting with it here we're
 

1037
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,769
this experimenting with it here we're
ideally we don't want to have to walk

1038
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:39,779
ideally we don't want to have to walk
 

1039
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,409
ideally we don't want to have to walk
forward either we're gonna try to get a

1040
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:42,419
forward either we're gonna try to get a
 

1041
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,230
forward either we're gonna try to get a
slime block launcher mixed into that so

1042
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,240
slime block launcher mixed into that so
 

1043
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,440
slime block launcher mixed into that so
let's say we're we're walking left we

1044
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,450
let's say we're we're walking left we
 

1045
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,909
let's say we're we're walking left we
get to the end of the section and then

1046
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
get to the end of the section and then
 

1047
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,500
get to the end of the section and then
it pushes us forward and then we start

1048
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,510
it pushes us forward and then we start
 

1049
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,149
it pushes us forward and then we start
walking right so hopefully we never have

1050
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:53,159
walking right so hopefully we never have
 

1051
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,330
walking right so hopefully we never have
to press the UP button on our keyboard

1052
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:55,340
to press the UP button on our keyboard
 

1053
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,789
to press the UP button on our keyboard
just left and right to zigzag through

1054
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
just left and right to zigzag through
 

1055
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,430
just left and right to zigzag through
the the thing make it a little bit nicer

1056
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
the the thing make it a little bit nicer
 

1057
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,169
the the thing make it a little bit nicer
if we can pull that off but anyways guys

1058
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:06,179
if we can pull that off but anyways guys
 

1059
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,029
if we can pull that off but anyways guys
I think that's gonna do it for today's

1060
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,039
I think that's gonna do it for today's
 

1061
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,379
I think that's gonna do it for today's
episode

1062
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:09,389
episode
 

1063
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:11,810
episode
problem with those those big projects I

1064
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:11,820
problem with those those big projects I
 

1065
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,999
problem with those those big projects I
do too much stuff off-camera not enough

1066
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:14,009
do too much stuff off-camera not enough
 

1067
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:16,249
do too much stuff off-camera not enough
on camera not enough variety and stuff

1068
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:16,259
on camera not enough variety and stuff
 

1069
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,039
on camera not enough variety and stuff
so we're gonna hopefully cut down on

1070
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,049
so we're gonna hopefully cut down on
 

1071
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:20,839
so we're gonna hopefully cut down on
them once we finish the few that we're

1072
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:20,849
them once we finish the few that we're
 

1073
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:23,749
them once we finish the few that we're
working on hopefully not doing many big

1074
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:23,759
working on hopefully not doing many big
 

1075
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,889
working on hopefully not doing many big
projects even though I think they're

1076
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:24,899
projects even though I think they're
 

1077
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,239
projects even though I think they're
really cool they're really interesting

1078
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:26,249
really cool they're really interesting
 

1079
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:29,719
really cool they're really interesting
they just take a lot of time get back to

1080
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:29,729
they just take a lot of time get back to
 

1081
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,209
they just take a lot of time get back to
the more simple more fun stuff coming up

1082
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:32,219
the more simple more fun stuff coming up
 

1083
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:35,209
the more simple more fun stuff coming up
here soon in fact I think next episode

1084
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:35,219
here soon in fact I think next episode
 

1085
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,339
here soon in fact I think next episode
we might even look into the snapshot

1086
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:37,349
we might even look into the snapshot
 

1087
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,009
we might even look into the snapshot
just for a bit of a I change out maybe

1088
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:40,019
just for a bit of a I change out maybe
 

1089
