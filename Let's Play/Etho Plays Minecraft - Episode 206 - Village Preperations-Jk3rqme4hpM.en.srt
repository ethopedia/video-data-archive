there I think we just want to extend
this further so I think if we go we set

174
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:58,770
this further so I think if we go we set
 

175
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,050
this further so I think if we go we set
it off somewhere around here oh let's

176
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,060
it off somewhere around here oh let's
 

177
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,000
it off somewhere around here oh let's

think we're safe to blow this up then
 

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,900
think we're safe to blow this up then
we're going to blow another big crater

to be used to be fun you know it was
guaranteed to him if you light something

238
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,050
guaranteed to him if you light something
 

239
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,150
guaranteed to him if you light something
on fire it's gonna go all go up pretty

240
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,160
on fire it's gonna go all go up pretty
 

241
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,940
on fire it's gonna go all go up pretty
much now it's like who knows what's

242
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:27,950
much now it's like who knows what's
 

243
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,560
much now it's like who knows what's
going to happen burn so slow it's random

244
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:34,570
going to happen burn so slow it's random
 

245
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,230
going to happen burn so slow it's random
what's the time it goes out unless you

246
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
what's the time it goes out unless you
 

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,610
what's the time it goes out unless you
have a lot of fuel this time it should

248
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:39,620
have a lot of fuel this time it should
 

249
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,430
have a lot of fuel this time it should
definitely go very anti-climatic though

250
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
definitely go very anti-climatic though
 

251
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:58,140
definitely go very anti-climatic though
ah well I just okay fine

252
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,150

 

253
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,670

not as big as the previous one

254
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:00,680
not as big as the previous one
 

255
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,700
not as big as the previous one
I don't think previous explosion that's

256
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:06,710
I don't think previous explosion that's
 

257
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,320
I don't think previous explosion that's
not bad though we cleared out a lot of

258
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,330
not bad though we cleared out a lot of
 

259
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,100
not bad though we cleared out a lot of
space with Daddy

260
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,110
space with Daddy
 

261
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:19,010
space with Daddy
even still let's just check it out

262
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,020

 

263
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,180

yeah look look how much space left

264
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,190
yeah look look how much space left
 

265
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,180
yeah look look how much space left
cleared out there as the most important

266
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,190
cleared out there as the most important
 

267
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,860
cleared out there as the most important
thing to me that it cleared out a fairly

268
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:25,870
thing to me that it cleared out a fairly
 

269
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,060
thing to me that it cleared out a fairly
high high amount of space not just yeah

270
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,070
high high amount of space not just yeah
 

271
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,130
high high amount of space not just yeah
this this is perfect so I'm going to

272
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,140
this this is perfect so I'm going to
 

273
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,640
this this is perfect so I'm going to
tear down this wall

274
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:34,650
tear down this wall
 

275
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,420
tear down this wall
tear down the wall I say and it should

276
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,430
tear down the wall I say and it should
 

277
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,970
tear down the wall I say and it should
feel pretty open up opened up in here

278
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:41,980
feel pretty open up opened up in here
 

279
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,820
feel pretty open up opened up in here
and then we'll put our village start

280
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:44,830
and then we'll put our village start
 

281
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,980
and then we'll put our village start
building it somewhere around here well

282
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:49,990
building it somewhere around here well
 

283
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,050
building it somewhere around here well
there we go guys this is what we are

284
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,060
there we go guys this is what we are
 

285
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,770
there we go guys this is what we are
working with now it's a lot of space

286
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:54,780
working with now it's a lot of space
 

287
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,440
working with now it's a lot of space
it's a big mess a really big mess

288
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,450
it's a big mess a really big mess
 

289
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,750
it's a big mess a really big mess
there's mobs around there's tunnels

290
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:00,760
there's mobs around there's tunnels
 

291
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,380
there's mobs around there's tunnels
everywhere I've been looking at it for a

292
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,390
everywhere I've been looking at it for a
 

293
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,510
everywhere I've been looking at it for a
while trying to decide how I want to do

294
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:06,520
while trying to decide how I want to do
 

295
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,950
while trying to decide how I want to do
it all and got roughly a plan first

296
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:13,960
it all and got roughly a plan first
 

297
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,440
it all and got roughly a plan first
thing just a I'm going to do I think

298
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,450
thing just a I'm going to do I think
 

299
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,500
thing just a I'm going to do I think
that this level here will be our ground

300
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:22,510
that this level here will be our ground
 

301
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,500
that this level here will be our ground
level so I'm going to shave this all off

302
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,510
level so I'm going to shave this all off
 

303
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,640
level so I'm going to shave this all off
and then with these millions of holes I

304
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:29,650
and then with these millions of holes I
 

305
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,870
and then with these millions of holes I
have around I'm going to start filling

306
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
have around I'm going to start filling
 

307
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,310
have around I'm going to start filling
them in just so you can get something

308
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
them in just so you can get something
 

309
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,210
them in just so you can get something
flat to work with wait yeah yeah that

310
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,220
flat to work with wait yeah yeah that
 

311
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,780
flat to work with wait yeah yeah that
should be about right and I talked about

312
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:42,790
should be about right and I talked about
 

313
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,090
should be about right and I talked about
what kind of blocks I plan on using for

314
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,100
what kind of blocks I plan on using for
 

315
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,460
what kind of blocks I plan on using for
this it's going to go with industrial

316
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,470
this it's going to go with industrial
 

317
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,020
this it's going to go with industrial
theme with lava and stone bricks and and

318
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,030
theme with lava and stone bricks and and
 

319
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,840
theme with lava and stone bricks and and
grass and all that slight change of

320
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:54,850
grass and all that slight change of
 

321
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,810
grass and all that slight change of
plans I think lately I've been building

322
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:57,820
plans I think lately I've been building
 

323
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,340
plans I think lately I've been building
a lot with snow and ice and I really

324
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,350
a lot with snow and ice and I really
 

325
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,590
a lot with snow and ice and I really
liked it it looks really good it's a

326
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,600
liked it it looks really good it's a
 

327
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,400
liked it it looks really good it's a
pain to collect it but yeah it's cool so

328
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,410
pain to collect it but yeah it's cool so
 

329
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,740
pain to collect it but yeah it's cool so
we're going to try to do an ice village

330
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:12,750

 

331
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,020

like pretty pure like mostly just snow

332
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,030
like pretty pure like mostly just snow
 

333
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,990
like pretty pure like mostly just snow
and ice might be one other type of block

334
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,000
and ice might be one other type of block
 

335
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,820
and ice might be one other type of block
like stone brick mixed in might still

336
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,830
like stone brick mixed in might still
 

337
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,280
like stone brick mixed in might still
put lava in that in if it'll look cool

338
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,290
put lava in that in if it'll look cool
 

339
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,210
put lava in that in if it'll look cool
it might not make sense

340
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,220
it might not make sense
 

341
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,030
it might not make sense
but yeah it's just what I'm thinking so

342
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
but yeah it's just what I'm thinking so
 

343
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,590
but yeah it's just what I'm thinking so
I'm going to have to put a layer of snow

344
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm going to have to put a layer of snow
 

345
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,150
I'm going to have to put a layer of snow
all over what I'm putting down here and

346
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
all over what I'm putting down here and
 

347
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,829
all over what I'm putting down here and
I should probably go through these

348
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
I should probably go through these
 

349
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,240
I should probably go through these
tunnels a little bit more on this one

350
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,250
tunnels a little bit more on this one
 

351
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,780
tunnels a little bit more on this one
dead ends some of them have dark spots I

352
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:48,790
dead ends some of them have dark spots I
 

353
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,759
dead ends some of them have dark spots I
don't want to hear mobs once I fill them

354
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:50,769
don't want to hear mobs once I fill them
 

355
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,620
don't want to hear mobs once I fill them
all up like I'm going to cover them so

356
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:52,630
all up like I'm going to cover them so
 

357
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,829
all up like I'm going to cover them so
mobs can't get into here but I want to

358
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
mobs can't get into here but I want to
 

359
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,569
mobs can't get into here but I want to
make sure there's no dark spots when I

360
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:57,579
make sure there's no dark spots when I
 

361
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,579
make sure there's no dark spots when I
do that otherwise I will hear mobs

362
00:11:59,579 --> 00:11:59,589
do that otherwise I will hear mobs
 

363
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:05,250
do that otherwise I will hear mobs
always when I'm in this area right so

364
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,260
always when I'm in this area right so
 

365
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,610
always when I'm in this area right so
snow ice filling up the holes what else

366
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:11,620
snow ice filling up the holes what else
 

367
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,449
snow ice filling up the holes what else
what else so we're just starting with

368
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:14,459
what else so we're just starting with
 

369
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,889
what else so we're just starting with
this make this area here we're going to

370
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:16,899
this make this area here we're going to
 

371
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,370
this make this area here we're going to
put a few houses around like a central

372
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:19,380
put a few houses around like a central
 

373
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,069
put a few houses around like a central
circle type thing that will all be

374
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:23,079
circle type thing that will all be
 

375
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,139
circle type thing that will all be
pretty close together and then we'll

376
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:25,149
pretty close together and then we'll
 

377
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,340
pretty close together and then we'll
expand from that and as we work on this

378
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,350
expand from that and as we work on this
 

379
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,380
expand from that and as we work on this
we'll add decorations and stuff like

380
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,390
we'll add decorations and stuff like
 

381
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,290
we'll add decorations and stuff like
that to it it's not going to be stone it

382
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:34,300
that to it it's not going to be stone it
 

383
00:12:34,300 --> 00:13:42,630
that to it it's not going to be stone it
won't look like this when it's all done

384
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:42,640

 

385
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,000

all right so we flattened out a bunch of

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,010
all right so we flattened out a bunch of
 

387
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,370
all right so we flattened out a bunch of
land here and we also harvested a bunch

388
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,380
land here and we also harvested a bunch
 

389
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,810
land here and we also harvested a bunch
of snow so we should be ready to go here

390
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:52,820
of snow so we should be ready to go here
 

391
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,900
of snow so we should be ready to go here
I marked that as the center those four

392
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:55,910
I marked that as the center those four
 

393
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,810
I marked that as the center those four
torches there it's in line with this

394
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:58,820
torches there it's in line with this
 

395
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,640
torches there it's in line with this
door and I think that'll work out good

396
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:03,650
door and I think that'll work out good
 

397
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,670
door and I think that'll work out good
what I what I'm going to do first is

398
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:06,680
what I what I'm going to do first is
 

399
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,960
what I what I'm going to do first is
just mark out a 16 by 16 circle so 1 2 3

400
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:10,970
just mark out a 16 by 16 circle so 1 2 3
 

401
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:18,579
just mark out a 16 by 16 circle so 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 see how big that looks and go

402
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:18,589
4 5 6 7 8 see how big that looks and go
 

403
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,620
4 5 6 7 8 see how big that looks and go
from there and then put the houses kind

404
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,630
from there and then put the houses kind
 

405
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:31,060
from there and then put the houses kind
of around it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 like 1 2 3

406
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,070
of around it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 like 1 2 3
 

407
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,160
of around it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 like 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8

4 5 6 7 8
 

409
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,780
4 5 6 7 8
I hope I'm counting right 1 2 3 4 5 6

410
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:37,790
I hope I'm counting right 1 2 3 4 5 6
 

411
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,960
I hope I'm counting right 1 2 3 4 5 6
wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

412
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:42,970
wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 

413
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,150
wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
alright so we got go a little more this

414
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
alright so we got go a little more this
 

415
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,680
alright so we got go a little more this
way for sure but yeah I've read up a

416
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:53,690
way for sure but yeah I've read up a

mechanic should feel listen and also I
 

429
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,360
mechanic should feel listen and also I
read up about sieges I had no idea those

430
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,370
read up about sieges I had no idea those
 

431
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,370
read up about sieges I had no idea those
were even in the game I never knew that

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,380
were even in the game I never knew that
 

433
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,329

and I just that's what happened look in
 

435
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:27,579
and I just that's what happened look in
last episode when I had all those

436

they can still spawn like in the village
 

453

you benefits lit up so you really need
iron golems or something to help protect

some of the fun from this because I
 

477
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,759
some of the fun from this because I
think it'll be exciting every time I get

478
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:27,769
think it'll be exciting every time I get
 

479
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:39,449
think it'll be exciting every time I get
a new villager yeah I'll have to mmm

480
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:39,459

 

481
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,309

feel like I need more TNT you go to blow

482
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:42,319
feel like I need more TNT you go to blow
 

483
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,860
feel like I need more TNT you go to blow
more space or something maybe I'll make

484
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:47,870
more space or something maybe I'll make
 

485
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,329
more space or something maybe I'll make
the circle smaller I'll try a smaller

486
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:52,339
the circle smaller I'll try a smaller
 

487
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,759
the circle smaller I'll try a smaller
circle or not you know it does look like

488
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:57,769
circle or not you know it does look like
 

489
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,139
circle or not you know it does look like
a good size I just need to clear out

490
00:16:59,139 --> 00:16:59,149
a good size I just need to clear out
 

491
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,809
a good size I just need to clear out
more space really all there is to it

492
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:01,819
more space really all there is to it
 

493
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,799
more space really all there is to it
I tried ice instead of stone brick and I

494
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:05,809
I tried ice instead of stone brick and I
 

495
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,069
I tried ice instead of stone brick and I
think that'll work out better besides

496
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,079
think that'll work out better besides
 

497
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,199
think that'll work out better besides
having villagers that can get be cool to

498
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,209
having villagers that can get be cool to
 

499
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,429
having villagers that can get be cool to
have a whole bunch of snow golems

500
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:12,439
have a whole bunch of snow golems
 

501
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,809
have a whole bunch of snow golems
running around here too so if you if you

502
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:16,819
running around here too so if you if you
 

503
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,399
running around here too so if you if you
use stone brick though the snow golems

504
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:18,409
use stone brick though the snow golems
 

505
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,230
use stone brick though the snow golems
are going to leave a snow covering over

506
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
are going to leave a snow covering over
 

507
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,079
are going to leave a snow covering over
top so you won't see it if you use ice

508
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,089
top so you won't see it if you use ice
 

509
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,350
top so you won't see it if you use ice
though they won't do that so that's one

510
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
though they won't do that so that's one
 

511
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,909
though they won't do that so that's one
of the reasons I decided to change it

512
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
of the reasons I decided to change it
 

513
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,770
of the reasons I decided to change it
and I'm just playing around with designs

514
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:32,780
and I'm just playing around with designs
 

515
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,149
and I'm just playing around with designs
here I'm going to be pretty creative

516
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:37,159
here I'm going to be pretty creative
 

517
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,480
here I'm going to be pretty creative
with the lighting I'm sure with this too

518
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,490
with the lighting I'm sure with this too
 

519
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,049
with the lighting I'm sure with this too
as ice melts let's mark this with

520
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:44,059
as ice melts let's mark this with
 

521
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,870
as ice melts let's mark this with
something besides torches it's going to

522
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
something besides torches it's going to
 

523
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,960
something besides torches it's going to
be real dark until we start settling in

524
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:49,970
be real dark until we start settling in
 

525
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,740
be real dark until we start settling in
here just want to try three circles

526
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:55,750
here just want to try three circles
 

527
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,180
here just want to try three circles
that's the center let's try put one here

528
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,190
that's the center let's try put one here
 

529
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,910
that's the center let's try put one here
three tiny circles inside the circle

530
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:04,920
three tiny circles inside the circle
 

531
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:12,250
three tiny circles inside the circle
I probably should moved it over more and

532
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,260

 

533
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,210

just see how that looks

534
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
just see how that looks
 

535
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:25,040
just see how that looks
I really need light though I need to

536
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,050
I really need light though I need to
 

537
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,140
I really need light though I need to
figure out what the light level is for

538
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,150
figure out what the light level is for
 

539
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,530
figure out what the light level is for
melting ice actually like exactly what

540
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:30,540
melting ice actually like exactly what
 

541
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,810
melting ice actually like exactly what
it is so I'm having that trouble I

542
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:32,820
it is so I'm having that trouble I
 

543
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,830
it is so I'm having that trouble I
thought it was supposed to be 12 maybe

544
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
thought it was supposed to be 12 maybe
 

545
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,110
thought it was supposed to be 12 maybe
we'll just set up a test here and I do

546
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
we'll just set up a test here and I do
 

547
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,560
we'll just set up a test here and I do
see you there or not he's gone put a

548
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:45,570
see you there or not he's gone put a
 

549
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,600
see you there or not he's gone put a
torch here that's 14 13 12 put one there

550
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,610
torch here that's 14 13 12 put one there
 

551
00:18:50,610 --> 00:19:00,710
torch here that's 14 13 12 put one there
and we will put one here and in a little

552
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
and we will put one here and in a little
 

553
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,080
and we will put one here and in a little
while we will check those up maybe we'll

554
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,090
while we will check those up maybe we'll
 

555
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,590
while we will check those up maybe we'll
do a fourth one so two blocks three

556
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:06,600
do a fourth one so two blocks three
 

557
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,960
do a fourth one so two blocks three
blocks one two three four and one more

558
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:11,970
blocks one two three four and one more
 

559
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:22,790
blocks one two three four and one more
there mmm yeah that doesn't look quite

560
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:22,800
there mmm yeah that doesn't look quite
 

561
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:30,040
there mmm yeah that doesn't look quite
right circles need to be up one maybe

562
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,050
right circles need to be up one maybe
 

563
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,570
right circles need to be up one maybe
the bottom ones oh my goodness I just

564
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:35,580
the bottom ones oh my goodness I just
 

565
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,150
the bottom ones oh my goodness I just
walked away for a second to get us so

566
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
walked away for a second to get us so
 

567
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:47,600
walked away for a second to get us so
touch unbelievable there are so many

568

touch unbelievable there are so many
 

569
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,090
touch unbelievable there are so many
mobs there now

570
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,100

 

571
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,190

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,070
I think I had that many tubes lit up no
 

575
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:24,110
I think I had that many tubes lit up no

no no can't believe that I've never seen
 

577
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,260
no no can't believe that I've never seen
anything like that over here you gotta

578
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,270
anything like that over here you gotta
 

579
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,640
anything like that over here you gotta
try this again I'm gonna walk away one

580
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,650
try this again I'm gonna walk away one
 

581
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:35,710
try this again I'm gonna walk away one
more time just just watch it okay

582
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:35,720

 

583
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,790

Moulson we're gone let's just walk away

584
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:42,800

 

585
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,390

see if they spawn I came in here I just

586
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,400
see if they spawn I came in here I just
 

587
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,150
see if they spawn I came in here I just
saw it like 100 spawning like they all

588
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,160
saw it like 100 spawning like they all
 

589
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:59,470
saw it like 100 spawning like they all
spawned yeah look at that that's unreal

590
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,480

 

591
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,110

huh all right anyway I'm going to fix

592
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
huh all right anyway I'm going to fix
 

593
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,140
huh all right anyway I'm going to fix
that pattern mmm I don't know guys this

594
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,150
that pattern mmm I don't know guys this
 

595
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,160
that pattern mmm I don't know guys this
is uh this isn't looking too good

596
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,170
is uh this isn't looking too good
 

597
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,720
is uh this isn't looking too good
I guess we'll break this into two two

598
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:17,730
I guess we'll break this into two two
 

599
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,550
I guess we'll break this into two two
things here first of all what do you

600
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:19,560
things here first of all what do you
 

601
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,250
things here first of all what do you
think of the pattern and second of all

602
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,260
think of the pattern and second of all
 

603
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,630
think of the pattern and second of all
what do you think of the block choice

604
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:25,640

 

605
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,630

personally I think this isn't going to

606
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:29,640
personally I think this isn't going to
 

607
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,020
personally I think this isn't going to
work I don't think we can do I think we

608
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,030
work I don't think we can do I think we
 

609
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,460
work I don't think we can do I think we
have to make it a rule where we can't

610
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,470
have to make it a rule where we can't
 

611
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,150
have to make it a rule where we can't
use ice on the ground is if we use ice

612
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,160
use ice on the ground is if we use ice
 

613
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,220
use ice on the ground is if we use ice
on the ground

614
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,230
on the ground
 

615
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,000
on the ground
we can't light up the snow and if you

616
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,010
we can't light up the snow and if you
 

617
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,430
we can't light up the snow and if you
don't light up the snow it looks

618
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
don't light up the snow it looks
 

619
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,610
don't light up the snow it looks
terrible absolutely terrible and I let's

620
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:52,620
terrible absolutely terrible and I let's
 

621
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,550
terrible absolutely terrible and I let's
just check what we got going on here so

622
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:55,560
just check what we got going on here so
 

623
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,410
just check what we got going on here so
it's been a while and only this one's

624
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,420
it's been a while and only this one's
 

625
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,180
it's been a while and only this one's
melted this is 14 13 12 11 so at light

626
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,190
melted this is 14 13 12 11 so at light
 

627
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,740
melted this is 14 13 12 11 so at light
level 11 is when ice melts

628
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:05,750
level 11 is when ice melts
 

629
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,120
level 11 is when ice melts
yeah it's going to be real tough to

630
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,130
yeah it's going to be real tough to
 

631
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,420
yeah it's going to be real tough to
light this up with that rule so maybe

632
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:13,430
light this up with that rule so maybe
 

633
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,560
light this up with that rule so maybe
maybe I'll play around with it a little

634
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:15,570
maybe I'll play around with it a little
 

635
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,780
maybe I'll play around with it a little
bit this is supposed to be again this is

636
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:17,790
bit this is supposed to be again this is
 

637
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,900
bit this is supposed to be again this is
supposed to be like a center and then

638
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:20,910
supposed to be like a center and then
 

639
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,920
supposed to be like a center and then
houses all around it and then also

640
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:24,930
houses all around it and then also
 

641
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,780
houses all around it and then also
branching off to maybe other areas

642
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:26,790
branching off to maybe other areas
 

643
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:33,080
branching off to maybe other areas
including up here yeah and this whole

644
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,090
including up here yeah and this whole
 

645
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,290
including up here yeah and this whole
area is supposed to be snow snow and ice

646
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:35,300
area is supposed to be snow snow and ice
 

647
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,200
area is supposed to be snow snow and ice
when this is done so I'm going to have

648
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,210
when this is done so I'm going to have
 

649
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,970
when this is done so I'm going to have
to imagine it a bit all right this is

650
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:43,980
to imagine it a bit all right this is
 

651
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,620
to imagine it a bit all right this is
with a different type of block we got

652
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:45,630
with a different type of block we got
 

653
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,500
with a different type of block we got
stone bricks now and I don't like it too

654
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,510
stone bricks now and I don't like it too
 

655
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,820
stone bricks now and I don't like it too
much so we're going to try something

656
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:49,830
much so we're going to try something
 

657
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,720
much so we're going to try something
else

658
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,730

 

659
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,010

here's another block type we got the

660
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,020
here's another block type we got the
 

661
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,440
here's another block type we got the
dark planks I like this a little bit

662
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,450
dark planks I like this a little bit
 

663
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,600
dark planks I like this a little bit
more than the stone stone brick but I'm

664
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,610
more than the stone stone brick but I'm
 

665
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:05,419
more than the stone stone brick but I'm
still not sold on it J new idea new idea

666
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:05,429
still not sold on it J new idea new idea
 

667
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,130
still not sold on it J new idea new idea
I think this one's going to be the

668
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:07,140
I think this one's going to be the
 

669
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,110
I think this one's going to be the
keeper what I'm going to do going to put

670
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,120
keeper what I'm going to do going to put
 

671
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,500
keeper what I'm going to do going to put
lava on the stone brick I put stone

672
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,510
lava on the stone brick I put stone
 

673
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,250
lava on the stone brick I put stone
brick around the circle and have lava

674
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,260
brick around the circle and have lava
 

675
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,640
brick around the circle and have lava
then glass and I think that will look

676
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:22,650
then glass and I think that will look
 

677
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,799
then glass and I think that will look
really cool you get rid of the torches

678
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:24,809
really cool you get rid of the torches
 

679
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:30,080
really cool you get rid of the torches
in and yeah I think that's I think

680
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,090
in and yeah I think that's I think
 

681
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,190
in and yeah I think that's I think
that's what we're going to try to do

682
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
that's what we're going to try to do
 

683
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,100
that's what we're going to try to do
here also I thought of another idea for

684
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,110
here also I thought of another idea for
 

685
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,120
here also I thought of another idea for
a pattern which might be better let's

686
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,130
a pattern which might be better let's
 

687
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,760
a pattern which might be better let's
try this out like fulfill this in first

688
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:43,770
try this out like fulfill this in first
 

689
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:50,990
try this out like fulfill this in first
I noticed something here over here it

690
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,000
I noticed something here over here it
 

691
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,410
I noticed something here over here it
kind of makes like it quarter circle so

692
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:54,420
kind of makes like it quarter circle so
 

693
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,060
kind of makes like it quarter circle so
I thought it might be cool to try do

694
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,070
I thought it might be cool to try do
 

695
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:04,669
I thought it might be cool to try do
this OOP this ready do something like

696
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:04,679
this OOP this ready do something like
 

697
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:11,600
this OOP this ready do something like
this and then shovels are too good way

698
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,610
this and then shovels are too good way
 

699
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,940
this and then shovels are too good way
too good sometimes like that

700
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:16,950
too good sometimes like that
 

701
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,770
too good sometimes like that
if we do that in all four corners let's

702
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:22,780
if we do that in all four corners let's
 

703
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,430
if we do that in all four corners let's
see how to look okay that gives us a

704
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:26,440
see how to look okay that gives us a
 

705
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,930
see how to look okay that gives us a
pattern like this and this is looking

706
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:27,940
pattern like this and this is looking
 

707
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,560
pattern like this and this is looking
cool let's let's continue we'll join

708
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:34,570
cool let's let's continue we'll join
 

709
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:41,640
cool let's let's continue we'll join
this these circles maybe here and then

710
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:41,650
this these circles maybe here and then
 

711
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,870
this these circles maybe here and then
see what that looks like

712
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
see what that looks like
 

713
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:51,390
see what that looks like
ooh awful ah once we once we figure out

714
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:51,400
ooh awful ah once we once we figure out
 

715
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,800
ooh awful ah once we once we figure out
what we're doing here it'll go quick

716
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:52,810
what we're doing here it'll go quick
 

717
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,020
what we're doing here it'll go quick
don't worry

718
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,030
don't worry
 

719
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,230
don't worry
sure bit the houses I kind of want to

720
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
sure bit the houses I kind of want to
 

721
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,530
sure bit the houses I kind of want to
build out of ice but I think I have to

722
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:01,540
build out of ice but I think I have to
 

723
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,600
build out of ice but I think I have to
put some kind of roof over that I don't

724
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,610
put some kind of roof over that I don't
 

725
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,670
put some kind of roof over that I don't
think they work if it's totally

726
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:05,680
think they work if it's totally
 

727
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,790
think they work if it's totally
transparent type of block all right

728
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:11,800
transparent type of block all right
 

729
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:20,220
transparent type of block all right
what's this look like that's pretty cool

730
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,230
what's this look like that's pretty cool
 

731
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:28,470
what's this look like that's pretty cool
um let's try one more thing here just

732
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
um let's try one more thing here just
 

733
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,790
um let's try one more thing here just
ten another idea let's do one of those

734
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:31,800
ten another idea let's do one of those
 

735
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,720
ten another idea let's do one of those
other circles inside it'll be kind of a

736
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:36,730
other circles inside it'll be kind of a
 

737
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,930
other circles inside it'll be kind of a
highlight that way and everywhere I'm

738
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:42,940
highlight that way and everywhere I'm
 

739
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,790
highlight that way and everywhere I'm
hollowing out here is going to be glass

740
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:44,800
hollowing out here is going to be glass
 

741
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,240
hollowing out here is going to be glass
with lava below that's the plan all

742
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,250
with lava below that's the plan all
 

743
00:25:51,250 --> 00:26:04,020
with lava below that's the plan all
right let's check this out

744
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,030

 

745
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,540

yeah I think you'll be cool okay so

746
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,550
yeah I think you'll be cool okay so
 

747
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,100
yeah I think you'll be cool okay so
that's that's what we're going to try

748
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,110
that's that's what we're going to try
 

749
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,830
that's that's what we're going to try
out I'm going to line line it all with

750
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:10,840
out I'm going to line line it all with
 

751
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,280
out I'm going to line line it all with
stone bricks oh my OCD feels good and

752
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,290
stone bricks oh my OCD feels good and
 

753
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,870
stone bricks oh my OCD feels good and
then fill it with lava and put the glass

754
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
then fill it with lava and put the glass
 

755
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,470
then fill it with lava and put the glass
and we'll see what it looks like and

756
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
and we'll see what it looks like and
 

757
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,060
and we'll see what it looks like and
there it is

758
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,070
there it is
 

759
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,030
there it is
so I'm liking this a lot more than what

760
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,040
so I'm liking this a lot more than what
 

761
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,670
so I'm liking this a lot more than what
we had before makes more sense it's a

762
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:29,680
we had before makes more sense it's a
 

763
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,990
we had before makes more sense it's a
lot brighter and should work out good as

764
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000
lot brighter and should work out good as
 

765
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,920
lot brighter and should work out good as
long as no creepers blow up on here that

766
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:37,930
long as no creepers blow up on here that
 

767
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,770
long as no creepers blow up on here that
would make a huge mess lava plus snow

768
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:40,780
would make a huge mess lava plus snow
 

769
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,130
would make a huge mess lava plus snow
and glass oh just everything would be

770
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,140
and glass oh just everything would be
 

771
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,130
and glass oh just everything would be
gone and leaking everywhere um yeah so I

772
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,140
gone and leaking everywhere um yeah so I
 

773
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,590
gone and leaking everywhere um yeah so I
started expanding this ooh this is going

774
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
started expanding this ooh this is going
 

775
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,020
started expanding this ooh this is going
to keep spending out quite a bit I'm

776
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,030
to keep spending out quite a bit I'm
 

777
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,030
to keep spending out quite a bit I'm
going to have to tear down a lot more of

778
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,040
going to have to tear down a lot more of
 

779
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,580
going to have to tear down a lot more of
the caves to like this has to go back

780
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:02,590
the caves to like this has to go back
 

781
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,190
the caves to like this has to go back
further every direction by a lot it's

782
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,200
further every direction by a lot it's
 

783
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,110
further every direction by a lot it's
going to be a big project hopefully I

784
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,120
going to be a big project hopefully I
 

785
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,230
going to be a big project hopefully I
think it's more T&T and will will expand

786
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,240
think it's more T&T and will will expand
 

787
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,140
think it's more T&T and will will expand
further but the very least this will do

788
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,150
further but the very least this will do
 

789
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,540
further but the very least this will do
for about four to eight houses I think

790
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,550
for about four to eight houses I think
 

791
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,480
for about four to eight houses I think
in our village and the main point of

792
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,490
in our village and the main point of
 

793
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,570
in our village and the main point of
