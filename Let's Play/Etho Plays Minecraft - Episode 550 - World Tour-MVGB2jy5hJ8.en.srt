have an ender chest nearby we got that
under the water

334
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
under the water
 

335
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,629
under the water
anvil hidden over here and you need a

336
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
anvil hidden over here and you need a
 

337
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,469
anvil hidden over here and you need a
crafting table as well

338
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
crafting table as well
 

339
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,510
crafting table as well
that pops out of the ground like a so

340
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
that pops out of the ground like a so
 

341
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,189
that pops out of the ground like a so
and also it's nice to have a smelting

342
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
and also it's nice to have a smelting
 

343
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,950
and also it's nice to have a smelting
room next to your storage room so that

344
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
room next to your storage room so that
 

345
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,230
room next to your storage room so that
is what this is over here

346
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
is what this is over here
 

347
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,270
is what this is over here
we can smelt stuff every time we put in

348
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
we can smelt stuff every time we put in
 

349
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,070
we can smelt stuff every time we put in
something

350
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
something
 

351
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,590
something
it plays a little tune the light turns

352
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
it plays a little tune the light turns
 

353
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,350
it plays a little tune the light turns
on and also uh

354
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
on and also uh
 

355
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,790
on and also uh
these lights over here turn on if

356
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
these lights over here turn on if
 

357
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,950
these lights over here turn on if
anything's smelting in the room

358
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
anything's smelting in the room
 

359
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,790
anything's smelting in the room
hmm i just realized these might be

360
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
hmm i just realized these might be
 

361
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,150
hmm i just realized these might be
backwards

362
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
backwards
 

363
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,189
backwards
i think they're supposed to play the

364
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
i think they're supposed to play the
 

365
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,670
i think they're supposed to play the
tune when they finish smelting

366
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
tune when they finish smelting
 

367
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,029
tune when they finish smelting
so you know they're done even if you're

368
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
so you know they're done even if you're
 

369
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,510
so you know they're done even if you're
not in the area but i guess just light

370
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
not in the area but i guess just light
 

371
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,550
not in the area but i guess just light
turns off

372
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
turns off
 

373
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,309
turns off
we got wire access over here if we want

374
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
we got wire access over here if we want
 

375
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,550
we got wire access over here if we want
to check out how the redstone works

376
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
to check out how the redstone works
 

377
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,790
to check out how the redstone works
i made the smelting room back when bud

378
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
i made the smelting room back when bud
 

379
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,390
i made the smelting room back when bud
switches were new in the game

380
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
switches were new in the game
 

381
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,590
switches were new in the game
block update detectors um now we have

382
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
block update detectors um now we have
 

383
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,270
block update detectors um now we have
observers which replace those

384
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
observers which replace those
 

385
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,830
observers which replace those
for the most part and as our world ages

386
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
for the most part and as our world ages
 

387
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,830
for the most part and as our world ages
we try to keep our older builds looking

388
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
we try to keep our older builds looking
 

389
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,950
we try to keep our older builds looking
pretty much the same as they did

390
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
pretty much the same as they did
 

391
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,230
pretty much the same as they did
originally but we do make a little

392
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
originally but we do make a little
 

393
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,510
originally but we do make a little
modifications

394
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
modifications
 

395
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,270
modifications
you can see we got a stone cutter here

396
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
you can see we got a stone cutter here
 

397
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,990
you can see we got a stone cutter here
now and the grindstone lanterns

398
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
now and the grindstone lanterns
 

399
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,710
now and the grindstone lanterns
shulker boxes in the ceiling those

400
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
shulker boxes in the ceiling those
 

401
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,309
shulker boxes in the ceiling those
aren't weren't there nine years ago i

402
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
aren't weren't there nine years ago i
 

403
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,670
aren't weren't there nine years ago i
tell you that

404
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
tell you that
 

405
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,510
tell you that
up the stairs here we have one of the

406
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
up the stairs here we have one of the
 

407
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,430
up the stairs here we have one of the
very first farms we built in the world

408
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
very first farms we built in the world
 

409
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,430
very first farms we built in the world
the pop-up sheep farm

410
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
the pop-up sheep farm
 

411
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,590
the pop-up sheep farm
um that we added this section a little

412
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
um that we added this section a little
 

413
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,590
um that we added this section a little
later in the series once hoppers came

414
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
later in the series once hoppers came
 

415
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,309
later in the series once hoppers came
out

416
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
out
 

417
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,189
out
but uh the idea is we can run along here

418
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
but uh the idea is we can run along here
 

419
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,189
but uh the idea is we can run along here
and share our sheep

420
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
and share our sheep
 

421
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,230
and share our sheep
like a so some of our builds in the

422
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
like a so some of our builds in the
 

423
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,790
like a so some of our builds in the
world

424
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
world
 

425
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,029
world
have broken due to updates and this is

426
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
have broken due to updates and this is
 

427
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,390
have broken due to updates and this is
one of the farms that

428
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
one of the farms that
 

429
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,110
one of the farms that
definitely has many times because it

430
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
definitely has many times because it
 

431
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,790
definitely has many times because it
uses so many different game mechanics

432
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
uses so many different game mechanics
 

433
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,270
uses so many different game mechanics
which

434
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
which
 

435
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,550
which
keep changing um but we tried to fix

436
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
keep changing um but we tried to fix
 

437
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,230
keep changing um but we tried to fix
stuff in this world as well so i think

438
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
stuff in this world as well so i think
 

439
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,830
stuff in this world as well so i think
at the moment this is working but not as

440
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
at the moment this is working but not as
 

441
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,950
at the moment this is working but not as
good as it did

442
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
good as it did
 

443
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,469
good as it did
originally

444
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479

 

445
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,390

always interrupting me so the way this

446
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
always interrupting me so the way this
 

447
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,070
always interrupting me so the way this
farm works is we got a block above the

448
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
farm works is we got a block above the
 

449
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,589
farm works is we got a block above the
sheep to hold them in place they're

450
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
sheep to hold them in place they're
 

451
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,189
sheep to hold them in place they're
about a block and a half tall so they

452
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
about a block and a half tall so they
 

453
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,950
about a block and a half tall so they
can't get out of this this air space

454
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
can't get out of this this air space
 

455
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,909
can't get out of this this air space
here

456
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
here
 

457
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,230
here
and uh originally when we would shear

458
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
and uh originally when we would shear
 

459
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,909
and uh originally when we would shear
the sheep the wall would always land

460
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
the sheep the wall would always land
 

461
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,670
the sheep the wall would always land
within a three by three area

462
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
within a three by three area
 

463
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,710
within a three by three area
now it can jump outside of that a bit um

464
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
now it can jump outside of that a bit um
 

465
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,790
now it can jump outside of that a bit um
and then we would use water to push the

466
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
and then we would use water to push the
 

467
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,790
and then we would use water to push the
wall down a grate here

468
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
wall down a grate here
 

469
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,309
wall down a grate here
and it would always land on the pressure

470
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
and it would always land on the pressure
 

471
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,909
and it would always land on the pressure
plate

472
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
plate
 

473
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,189
plate
now it can get stuck on the fence rarely

474
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
now it can get stuck on the fence rarely
 

475
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,710
now it can get stuck on the fence rarely
and when it would trigger the redstone

476
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
and when it would trigger the redstone
 

477
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,870
and when it would trigger the redstone
the sheep goes down

478
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
the sheep goes down
 

479
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,070
the sheep goes down
and then grass grows to the dirt block

480
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
and then grass grows to the dirt block
 

481
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,990
and then grass grows to the dirt block
there triggers a bud switch and then

482
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
there triggers a bud switch and then
 

483
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,270
there triggers a bud switch and then
when they eat it it triggers

484
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
when they eat it it triggers
 

485
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,869
when they eat it it triggers
it again and they pop up so

486
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
it again and they pop up so
 

487
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,230
it again and they pop up so
let's just head to the end here where we

488
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
let's just head to the end here where we
 

489
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,230
let's just head to the end here where we
got our controls so there's a water

490
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
got our controls so there's a water
 

491
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,270
got our controls so there's a water
bucket control

492
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
bucket control
 

493
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,189
bucket control
over here sends water down to push the

494
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
over here sends water down to push the
 

495
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,749
over here sends water down to push the
wool

496
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
wool
 

497
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,869
wool
down the grates and then all the sheep

498
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
down the grates and then all the sheep
 

499
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,390
down the grates and then all the sheep

and reset the ones that didn't have it
sheared before would stay

506
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
sheared before would stay
 

507
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,749

we do it that way so the piston kind of

526
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
we do it that way so the piston kind of
 

527
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,710
we do it that way so the piston kind of
matches the wood color up there

is pretty gimmicky mushrooms would grow
 

615
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,070
is pretty gimmicky mushrooms would grow
in there and then the water would

616
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
in there and then the water would
 

617
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,670
in there and then the water would
harvest them

618
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
harvest them
 

619
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,269

general idea with the man cave was to
 

629
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,670
general idea with the man cave was to
fill up any empty spaces we might have

630
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
fill up any empty spaces we might have
 

631
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,110
fill up any empty spaces we might have
with contraptions or

632
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
with contraptions or
 

633
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,509
with contraptions or
farms or anything we want to build and

farms or anything we want to build and
 

635
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,590
farms or anything we want to build and
then link those together with paths and

636
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
then link those together with paths and
 

637
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,069
then link those together with paths and
then

638
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
then
 

639
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,750
then
finally decorate them and make them look

640
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
finally decorate them and make them look
 

641
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,509

i've made many bases since then
 

649
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,630
i've made many bases since then
i find this works a lot better than like

650
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
i find this works a lot better than like
 

651
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,870
i find this works a lot better than like
pre-building a base and filling it

652
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
pre-building a base and filling it
 

653
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,030
pre-building a base and filling it

753
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,990
this used to shoot out a hoe at the end
here we would use to till the ground

754
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
here we would use to till the ground
 

755
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,870
here we would use to till the ground
because

756
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
because
 

757
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,790
because
originally pumpkins and melons would not

758
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
originally pumpkins and melons would not
 

759
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,949
originally pumpkins and melons would not
grow on regular dirt like this it had to

760

be tilled
 

763
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,750
be tilled
and then we would step on this it would

764
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
and then we would step on this it would
 

765
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,670
and then we would step on this it would
go down and they would grow again we can

a long time
 

785
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,389
a long time
and then when i generated this world it

786

and orange for fire resistance regen
 

1071
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,390
and orange for fire resistance regen
that was pretty cool we got some pixel

1072
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
that was pretty cool we got some pixel
 

1073
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,830

art in the floor

1074
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
art in the floor
 

1075
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,070
art in the floor
as well as our main brewing area over

1076
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
as well as our main brewing area over
 

1077
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,950
as well as our main brewing area over
here so the idea

1078
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
here so the idea
 

1079
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,350
here so the idea
is we would stand underneath the water

1080
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
is we would stand underneath the water
 

1081
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,110
is we would stand underneath the water
if we wanted glass bottles we'd hit the

1082
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
if we wanted glass bottles we'd hit the
 

1083
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,430
if we wanted glass bottles we'd hit the
top button

1084
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
top button
 

1085
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,110
top button
and funny enough with the way the game

1086
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
and funny enough with the way the game
 

1087
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,549
and funny enough with the way the game
is now this

1088
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
is now this
 

1089
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,510
is now this
actually gives us filled water bottles

1090
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
actually gives us filled water bottles
 

1091
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,150
actually gives us filled water bottles
that's

1092
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
that's
 

1093
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,029
that's
not what originally happened um you

1094
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
not what originally happened um you
 

1095
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,549
not what originally happened um you
would get glass bottles and you

1096
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
would get glass bottles and you
 

1097
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,630
would get glass bottles and you
this was within reach so you'd hold

1098
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
this was within reach so you'd hold
 

1099
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,669
this was within reach so you'd hold
right click and then they would get

1100
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
right click and then they would get
 

1101
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,630
right click and then they would get
thrown up like this

1102
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
thrown up like this
 

1103
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,270
thrown up like this
and filled and then you would use those

1104
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
and filled and then you would use those
 

1105
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,190
and filled and then you would use those
to fill up the brewing stands all of the

1106
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
to fill up the brewing stands all of the
 

1107
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,110
to fill up the brewing stands all of the
brewing stands are within reach

1108
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
brewing stands are within reach
 

1109
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,470
brewing stands are within reach
you don't have to move at all to get to

1110
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
you don't have to move at all to get to
 

1111
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,630
you don't have to move at all to get to
them and then like if you wanted

1112
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
them and then like if you wanted
 

1113
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,310
them and then like if you wanted
netherwork you would get the netherwart

1114
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320

 

1115
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,310

i guess there's only one left if you

1116
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
i guess there's only one left if you
 

1117
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,590
i guess there's only one left if you
wanted uh

1118
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
wanted uh
 

1119
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,070
wanted uh
redstone or gunpowder you would hit this

1120
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
redstone or gunpowder you would hit this
 

1121
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,029
redstone or gunpowder you would hit this
and uh

1122
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
and uh
 

1123
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,789
and uh
then you'd pick your final ingredient

1124
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
then you'd pick your final ingredient
 

1125
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,230
then you'd pick your final ingredient
sugar maybe for

1126
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
sugar maybe for
 

1127
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,230
sugar maybe for
swiftness potions everything would get

1128
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
swiftness potions everything would get
 

1129
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,070
swiftness potions everything would get
dispensed in this one spot you'd brew

1130

get pushed towards us and also there was
 

1281
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,070
get pushed towards us and also there was
an old trick in the game if you had

but they removed that pretty shortly
 

1291
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,510
but they removed that pretty shortly
after it was discovered

1292
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
after it was discovered
 

1293
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,710

uh and then there's also a way of
 

1295
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,110
uh and then there's also a way of
getting back here

1296

40 and less so we made a spawning pad in

1330
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
40 and less so we made a spawning pad in
 

1331
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,029
40 and less so we made a spawning pad in
a slime chunk they jump off the pad

1332
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
a slime chunk they jump off the pad
 

1333
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,190
a slime chunk they jump off the pad
into the water streams around here

1334
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
into the water streams around here
 

1335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,190
into the water streams around here
slimes used to sink so they'd fall down

1336
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
slimes used to sink so they'd fall down
 

1337
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
slimes used to sink so they'd fall down
these holes and die

1338
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
these holes and die
 

1339
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,430
these holes and die
um but now they just float over top of

1340
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
um but now they just float over top of
 

1341
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,070
um but now they just float over top of
them

1342
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
them
 

1343
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,590
them
and they go up an elevator here whoop

1344
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
and they go up an elevator here whoop
 

1345
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,549
and they go up an elevator here whoop
whole big thing here there's also like

1346
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
whole big thing here there's also like
 

1347
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,909
whole big thing here there's also like
some lava blades and stuff

1348
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
some lava blades and stuff
 

1349
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,270
some lava blades and stuff
i think we used to have in here but we

1350
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
i think we used to have in here but we
 

1351
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,590
i think we used to have in here but we
got rid of small slimes

1352
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,600
got rid of small slimes
 

1353
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,950
got rid of small slimes
fall down a one by one area and then the

1354
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
fall down a one by one area and then the
 

1355
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,669
fall down a one by one area and then the
medium ones

1356
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
medium ones
 

1357
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,470
medium ones
medium ones down a two wide area and

1358
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
medium ones down a two wide area and
 

1359
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,669
medium ones down a two wide area and
then there's the big

1360
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
then there's the big
 

1361
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,270
then there's the big
boys that land over here and they end up

1362
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
boys that land over here and they end up
 

1363
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,230
boys that land over here and they end up
in this spot

1364
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
in this spot
 

1365
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,190
in this spot
and then there's also a minecart system

1366
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
and then there's also a minecart system
 

1367
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,549
and then there's also a minecart system
which i think is empty at the moment

1368
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
which i think is empty at the moment
 

1369
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,470
which i think is empty at the moment
that would pick up the slimes they would

1370
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
that would pick up the slimes they would
 

1371
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,630
that would pick up the slimes they would
go down here

1372
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
go down here
 

1373
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,230
go down here
a couple uh renegades they'd fall down

1374
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
a couple uh renegades they'd fall down
 

1375
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,470
a couple uh renegades they'd fall down
and then they run around the track

1376
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
and then they run around the track
 

1377
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,070
and then they run around the track
underneath some

1378
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
underneath some
 

1379
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,870
underneath some
slabs and the reason we did this is just

1380
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
slabs and the reason we did this is just
 

1381
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,390
slabs and the reason we did this is just
because it looked funny

1382
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
because it looked funny
 

1383
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,390
because it looked funny
and they kind of push you around so when

1384
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
and they kind of push you around so when
 

1385
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,990
and they kind of push you around so when
the big guys here go into the mine cart

1386
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
the big guys here go into the mine cart
 

1387
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,070
the big guys here go into the mine cart
we can watch it fall down and go along

1388
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
we can watch it fall down and go along
 

1389
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,470
we can watch it fall down and go along
here

1390
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
here
 

1391
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,669
here
and also that we had a whole system for

1392
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
and also that we had a whole system for
 

1393
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,270
and also that we had a whole system for
when they would despawn and the mine

1394
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
when they would despawn and the mine
 

1395
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,950
when they would despawn and the mine
carts would become empty there was a way

1396
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
carts would become empty there was a way
 

1397
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,990
carts would become empty there was a way
of detecting that

1398
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
of detecting that
 

1399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,669
of detecting that
and the empty mine minecarts would go

1400
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
and the empty mine minecarts would go
 

1401
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,190
and the empty mine minecarts would go
back into the system

1402
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
back into the system
 

1403
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,750
back into the system
it ram into a cactus and go into the

1404
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
it ram into a cactus and go into the
 

1405
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,830
it ram into a cactus and go into the
dispenser here to be reused

1406
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
dispenser here to be reused
 

1407
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,149
dispenser here to be reused
so it was a whole whole big thing and

1408
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
so it was a whole whole big thing and
 

1409
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,830
so it was a whole whole big thing and
also there's a viewing window for that

1410
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
also there's a viewing window for that
 

1411
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,789
also there's a viewing window for that
over here

1412
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
over here
 

1413
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,390
over here
okay so we got a lot of stuff to cover

1414
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
okay so we got a lot of stuff to cover
 

1415
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,549
okay so we got a lot of stuff to cover
in the man game let's keep going here

1416
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
in the man game let's keep going here
 

1417
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,789
in the man game let's keep going here
uh we haven't gone down this path yet

1418
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
uh we haven't gone down this path yet
 

1419
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,750
uh we haven't gone down this path yet

1426
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
uh
 

1427

bananas we were gonna stash a big pile

1430
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
bananas we were gonna stash a big pile
 

1431
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,590
bananas we were gonna stash a big pile
of diamonds here or

1432
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
of diamonds here or
 

1433

emeralds but never ended up doing it

1434
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
emeralds but never ended up doing it
 

1435
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,750
emeralds but never ended up doing it
then i wanted to store my

1436
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
then i wanted to store my
 

1437
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,110
then i wanted to store my
broken tools here we got a few of them

1438
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
broken tools here we got a few of them
 

1439
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,950
broken tools here we got a few of them
but then they introduced mending into

1440
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
but then they introduced mending into
 

1441
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,510
but then they introduced mending into
the game

1442
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
the game
 

1443
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,350
the game
so yeah it's like

1444
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
so yeah it's like
 

1445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,669
so yeah it's like
unfinished area got a branching path

1446
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
unfinished area got a branching path
 

1447
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,149
unfinished area got a branching path
that goes across our river

1448
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
that goes across our river
 

1449
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,630
that goes across our river
goes down here it's a little decorative

1450
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
goes down here it's a little decorative
 

1451
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,470
goes down here it's a little decorative
area we don't build a lot of new stuff

1452
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
area we don't build a lot of new stuff
 

1453
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,070
area we don't build a lot of new stuff
in the man cave anymore but

1454
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
in the man cave anymore but
 

1455
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,950
in the man cave anymore but
recently we added a bunch of stuff here

1456
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
recently we added a bunch of stuff here
 

1457
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,390
recently we added a bunch of stuff here
except for the vine wall this was here

1458
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
except for the vine wall this was here
 

1459
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,430
except for the vine wall this was here
for a long time

1460
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
for a long time
 

1461
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,470
for a long time
so we get our shears vines grow against

1462
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
so we get our shears vines grow against
 

1463
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,750
so we get our shears vines grow against
the wall

1464
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
the wall
 

1465
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,430
the wall
sometimes they land in the water most of

1466
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
sometimes they land in the water most of
 

1467
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,029
sometimes they land in the water most of
the time they don't and then there's

1468
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
the time they don't and then there's
 

1469
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,269
the time they don't and then there's
hoppers below to pick them up

1470
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
hoppers below to pick them up
 

1471
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,909
hoppers below to pick them up
this is a very odd contraption there we

1472
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:17,919
this is a very odd contraption there we
 

1473
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,750
this is a very odd contraption there we
have a long history of burning diamonds

1474
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
have a long history of burning diamonds
 

1475
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,909
have a long history of burning diamonds
in this series so we made a contraption

1476
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
in this series so we made a contraption
 

1477
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,510
in this series so we made a contraption
just for that when the blue fire came

1478
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
just for that when the blue fire came
 

1479
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,990
just for that when the blue fire came
out in the game you get the diamond you

1480
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
out in the game you get the diamond you
 

1481
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,190
out in the game you get the diamond you
throw it in the fire

1482
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
throw it in the fire
 

1483
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,029
throw it in the fire
and it turns blue incredible

1484
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
and it turns blue incredible
 

1485
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,510
and it turns blue incredible
and then we hit this one so we can burn

1486
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
and then we hit this one so we can burn
 

1487
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,190
and then we hit this one so we can burn
more diamonds

1488
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
more diamonds
 

1489
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,070
more diamonds

area is done
 

1799
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,669
area is done
uh down this way we have the end

1800
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
uh down this way we have the end
 

1801
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,310
uh down this way we have the end
reporter we'll get more into that later

1802
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
reporter we'll get more into that later
 

1803

reporter we'll get more into that later
we also have a path that leads to the

1804
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
we also have a path that leads to the
 

1805
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,990
we also have a path that leads to the
stronghold base and i think this

1806
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
stronghold base and i think this
 

1807
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,950
stronghold base and i think this
connects to the

1808
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
connects to the
 

1809
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,350
connects to the
guardian farm although i might have

1810
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
guardian farm although i might have
 

1811
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,350
guardian farm although i might have
covered that up recently

then this was just a open space we had
 

1815
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,990
then this was just a open space we had
so i put something here we got a

1816
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
so i put something here we got a
 

1817
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,190
so i put something here we got a
flower farm

1818
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200

 

1819
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,230

super fast

1820
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240

 

1821
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,909

slimes always jump on the pressure

1822
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919
slimes always jump on the pressure
 

1823
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,269
slimes always jump on the pressure
plates and trigger it when i don't want

1824
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
plates and trigger it when i don't want
 

1825
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,669
plates and trigger it when i don't want
them to

1826
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
them to
 

1827
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,430
them to
and legs of the world it's great yeah

1828
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
and legs of the world it's great yeah
 

1829
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,669
and legs of the world it's great yeah
it's great design guys

1830
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
it's great design guys
 

1831
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,669
it's great design guys
you can see our cave spiders oh yeah and

1832
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
you can see our cave spiders oh yeah and
 

1833
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,190
you can see our cave spiders oh yeah and
this is where we actually get the drops

1834
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
this is where we actually get the drops
 

1835
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,630
this is where we actually get the drops
from these guys so let's go check this

1836
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
from these guys so let's go check this
 

1837
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,350
from these guys so let's go check this
out

1838
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
out
 

1839
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,269
out
so they used to go up the spider

1840
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
so they used to go up the spider
 

1841
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,870
so they used to go up the spider
elevator and then we changed it so they

1842
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
elevator and then we changed it so they
 

1843
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,990
elevator and then we changed it so they
just fall down

1844
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
just fall down
 

1845
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,789
just fall down
they land on the trip wires and then

1846
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
they land on the trip wires and then
 

1847
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,230
they land on the trip wires and then
that makes the minecart

1848
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
that makes the minecart
 

1849
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,990
that makes the minecart
get moving here picks up the drops

1850
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
get moving here picks up the drops
 

1851
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,669
get moving here picks up the drops
through the slabs

1852
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
through the slabs
 

1853
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,789
through the slabs
and deposits them in the chest and uh

1854
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
and deposits them in the chest and uh
 

1855
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,710
and deposits them in the chest and uh
another one set up exactly like that as

1856
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
another one set up exactly like that as
 

1857
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,990
another one set up exactly like that as
well

1858
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
well
 

1859
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,430
well
and it's got a little creeper face

1860
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
and it's got a little creeper face
 

1861
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,350
and it's got a little creeper face
design on the slabs

1862
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
design on the slabs
 

1863
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,350
design on the slabs
um fishing got improved in the game at

1864
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
um fishing got improved in the game at
 

1865
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,830
um fishing got improved in the game at
one point so you used to only get fish

1866
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
one point so you used to only get fish
 

1867
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,830
one point so you used to only get fish
just the regular standard fish and then

1868
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
just the regular standard fish and then
 

1869
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,269
just the regular standard fish and then
they added the

1870
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
they added the
 

1871
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,310
they added the
looting and leer

1872
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
looting and leer
 

1873
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,110
looting and leer
yeah i think that's the two so we made a

1874
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
yeah i think that's the two so we made a
 

1875
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,350
yeah i think that's the two so we made a
fishing shack where we could uh

1876
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
fishing shack where we could uh
 

1877
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,549
fishing shack where we could uh
just fish yeah uh

1878
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
just fish yeah uh
 

1879
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,029
just fish yeah uh
this is the man-made river kind of

1880
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
this is the man-made river kind of
 

1881
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,230
this is the man-made river kind of
branches out through

1882
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
branches out through
 

1883
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,750
branches out through
different places in the base as well so

1884
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
different places in the base as well so
 

1885
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,269
different places in the base as well so
it comes down to the fishing shack and

1886
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
it comes down to the fishing shack and
 

1887
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,630
it comes down to the fishing shack and
fills up the pond

1888
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
fills up the pond
 

1889
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,310
fills up the pond
and we also have the river branching

1890
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
and we also have the river branching
 

1891
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,990
and we also have the river branching
down here it creates a small

1892
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
down here it creates a small
 

1893
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,750
down here it creates a small
decorative waterfall which i think looks

1894
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
decorative waterfall which i think looks
 

1895
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,710
decorative waterfall which i think looks
pretty nice down to the lower section

1896
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
pretty nice down to the lower section
 

1897
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,870
pretty nice down to the lower section
uh this area is mostly decorative but we

1898
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
uh this area is mostly decorative but we
 

1899
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,950
uh this area is mostly decorative but we
do have a little bit of a farm here this

1900
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
do have a little bit of a farm here this
 

1901
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,029
do have a little bit of a farm here this
used to be a rabbit farm

1902
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
used to be a rabbit farm
 

1903
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,710
used to be a rabbit farm
which is why we planted the carrots all

1904
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
which is why we planted the carrots all
 

1905
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,710
which is why we planted the carrots all
around it um

1906
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,720
around it um
 

1907
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,470
around it um
in the past you had to tie them to

1908
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
in the past you had to tie them to
 

1909
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,870
in the past you had to tie them to
fences on leads otherwise i think they

1910
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
fences on leads otherwise i think they
 

1911
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,710
fences on leads otherwise i think they
would get away or despawn or something

1912
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
would get away or despawn or something
 

1913
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,149
would get away or despawn or something
was weird with it

1914
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
was weird with it
 

1915
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,830
was weird with it
and then you would feed them through

1916
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840
and then you would feed them through
 

1917
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,750
and then you would feed them through
here

1918
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
here
 

1919
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,630
here
some remnants still remain i think they

1920
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
some remnants still remain i think they
 

1921
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,070
some remnants still remain i think they
all disappeared eventually i don't know

1922
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
all disappeared eventually i don't know
 

1923
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,870
all disappeared eventually i don't know
why

1924
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
why
 

1925
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,230
why
but then there was some stuff for

1926
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
but then there was some stuff for
 

1927
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,990
but then there was some stuff for
oh i think we'd use the water so they'd

1928
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
oh i think we'd use the water so they'd
 

1929
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,750
oh i think we'd use the water so they'd
hop around and make it easier to feed

1930
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
hop around and make it easier to feed
 

1931
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,509
hop around and make it easier to feed
them

1932
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
them
 

1933
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,990
them
and then there's poison to get them down

1934
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
and then there's poison to get them down
 

1935
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,269
and then there's poison to get them down
to

1936
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
to
 

1937
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,830
to
i don't know one hit kill or something

1938
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:37,840

 

1939
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,149

and that was for collecting the drops or

1940
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
and that was for collecting the drops or
 

1941
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,269
and that was for collecting the drops or
something i don't know it's all very

1942
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
something i don't know it's all very
 

1943
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,470
something i don't know it's all very
confusing

1944
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
confusing
 

1945
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,310
confusing
um eventually they all disappeared

1946
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
um eventually they all disappeared
 

1947
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,909
um eventually they all disappeared
though so we turned this into a pig farm

1948
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
though so we turned this into a pig farm
 

1949
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,590
though so we turned this into a pig farm
who also eat carrots so it worked out

1950
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
who also eat carrots so it worked out
 

1951
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,950

this goes down further this is mostly
 

1955
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,430
this goes down further this is mostly
unfinished down this way

unfinished down this way
 

1957
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,470
unfinished down this way
but we did put down an eats road in here

1958
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
but we did put down an eats road in here
 

1959

00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039
transportation system i invented a long
 

1963
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,990
transportation system i invented a long
time ago

1964
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,000
time ago
 

1965
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,590
time ago
doesn't work in the game anymore but you

doesn't work in the game anymore but you
could ride boats down a track

1968
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
could ride boats down a track
 

1969
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,269
could ride boats down a track
i'm a pretty big fan of branching paths

1970
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
i'm a pretty big fan of branching paths
 

1971
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,389
i'm a pretty big fan of branching paths
if you couldn't tell so

1972
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
if you couldn't tell so
 

1973
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,230
if you couldn't tell so
at the intersection we can also go this

1974
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
at the intersection we can also go this
 

1975
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,029
at the intersection we can also go this
way this leads over to the creeper face

1976
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
way this leads over to the creeper face
 

1977
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,269
way this leads over to the creeper face
and uh oh we just saw it shoot arrows

1978
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
and uh oh we just saw it shoot arrows
 

1979
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,230
and uh oh we just saw it shoot arrows

sickness randomizer based on health
levels so this is a variable randomizer

2298

levels so this is a variable randomizer
 

2299
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,270
levels so this is a variable randomizer
depending on his health level he's more

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
it like operates in three different
 

2305
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,829
it like operates in three different
stages um

2306
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:37,839
stages um
 

2307
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,589
stages um
also so that's like his immune system

2308
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
also so that's like his immune system
 

2309
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,230
also so that's like his immune system
he's got a stomach so as we feed him it

2310
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,240
he's got a stomach so as we feed him it
 

2311
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,150
he's got a stomach so as we feed him it
takes a while for him to digest his food

2312
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
takes a while for him to digest his food
 

2313
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,589
takes a while for him to digest his food
if you keep feeding him

2314
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
if you keep feeding him
 

2315
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,670
if you keep feeding him
before his stomach empties then he gains

2316
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
before his stomach empties then he gains
 

2317
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,990
before his stomach empties then he gains
weight faster

2318
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
weight faster
 

2319
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,870
weight faster
also he's got a bladder system over here

2320
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
also he's got a bladder system over here
 

2321
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,829
also he's got a bladder system over here
i think

2322
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
i think
 

2323
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,950
i think
so every once in a while he takes a poop

2324
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
so every once in a while he takes a poop
 

2325
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,190
so every once in a while he takes a poop
and then his weight drops by a bunch um

2326
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200
and then his weight drops by a bunch um
 

2327
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,550
and then his weight drops by a bunch um
and it's supposed to like

2328
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
and it's supposed to like
 

2329
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,190
and it's supposed to like
flood the room or something and you have

2330
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
flood the room or something and you have
 

2331
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,630
flood the room or something and you have
to clean it up otherwise his happiness

2332
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
to clean it up otherwise his happiness
 

2333
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,030
to clean it up otherwise his happiness

and check out the redstone and this was

2376
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
and check out the redstone and this was
 

2377
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,349
and check out the redstone and this was
supposed to continue on and expand the

2378

supposed to continue on and expand the
 

2379
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,109
supposed to continue on and expand the
base but we haven't

2380

base but we haven't
 

2381
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,230

gone beyond that yet then we can go down

this way to a new room this is
 

2385
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,589
this way to a new room this is
like a flooded area so we're on a pier

and it's mostly just decorative we also
 

2389
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,510
and it's mostly just decorative we also

uh
 

2399
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,069
uh
this is where we used to keep our good

2400
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:12,079
this is where we used to keep our good
 

2401
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,990
this is where we used to keep our good
horses until the slimes let a bunch of

2402
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,000
horses until the slimes let a bunch of
 

2403
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,470
horses until the slimes let a bunch of
them out and they died in the water here

2404
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
them out and they died in the water here

that's when we moved zenith behind the

2406
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
that's when we moved zenith behind the
 

2407
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,670
that's when we moved zenith behind the
window so he would be safe

2408
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
window so he would be safe
 

2409
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,069
window so he would be safe
from the slimes uh this i don't think

2410
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
from the slimes uh this i don't think
 

2411
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,430
from the slimes uh this i don't think
works anymore but we used to be able to

2412
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
works anymore but we used to be able to
 

2413
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,109
works anymore but we used to be able to
ride a horse up the elevator

a while so we made a machine there to
 

2467
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,950
a while so we made a machine there to
kind of visualize it and then this is an

2468
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:24,960
kind of visualize it and then this is an
 

2469
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,829
kind of visualize it and then this is an
armory

2470
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:25,839
armory
 

2471
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,430
armory
you used to be able to put armor stands

2472
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
you used to be able to put armor stands
 

2473
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,270
you used to be able to put armor stands
in mine carts you can't do that anymore

2474
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
in mine carts you can't do that anymore
 

2475
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,750
in mine carts you can't do that anymore
but we had a swapping system for like

2476
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
but we had a swapping system for like
 

2477
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,349
but we had a swapping system for like
picking them up and then another one

2478
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
picking them up and then another one
 

2479
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:33,910
picking them up and then another one
would drop

2480
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
would drop
 

2481
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,910
would drop
down but uh all the minecart stuff broke

2482
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
down but uh all the minecart stuff broke
 

2483
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,109
down but uh all the minecart stuff broke
with that now i just

2484
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
with that now i just
 

2485
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,150
with that now i just
store some random tools and stuff here

2486
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,160
store some random tools and stuff here
 

2487
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,910
store some random tools and stuff here
this leads back to that area we saw

2488
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
this leads back to that area we saw
 

2489
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,190
this leads back to that area we saw
before

2490
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
before
 

2491
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,630
before
yeah so a lot of the things we've seen

2492
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
yeah so a lot of the things we've seen
 

2493
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,230
yeah so a lot of the things we've seen
so far some of them are useful some of

2494
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
so far some of them are useful some of
 

2495
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,270
so far some of them are useful some of
them not so much

2496
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
them not so much
 

2497
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,870
them not so much
but pretty much everything down this

2498
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
but pretty much everything down this
 

2499
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,190
but pretty much everything down this

all the time like this is an area we
 

2503
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,109
all the time like this is an area we
frequent this leads to

2504
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
frequent this leads to
 

2505
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,589
frequent this leads to

but you didn't expect that these lights

2524
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:17,359
but you didn't expect that these lights
 

2525
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,470
but you didn't expect that these lights
tell us if there's

2526
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
tell us if there's
 

2527
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,670
tell us if there's
uh awkward potions available for brewing

2528
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680
uh awkward potions available for brewing
 

2529
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,589
uh awkward potions available for brewing
and basically we can brew every single

2530
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
and basically we can brew every single
 

2531
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,430
and basically we can brew every single
potion automatically here

2532
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
potion automatically here
 

2533
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,230
potion automatically here
and it does it in a chain system so at

2534
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
and it does it in a chain system so at
 

2535
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,550
and it does it in a chain system so at
the start there's awkward potions

2536
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
the start there's awkward potions
 

2537
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,390
the start there's awkward potions
then it adds an ingredient and then we

2538
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
then it adds an ingredient and then we
 

2539
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,309
then it adds an ingredient and then we
got night vision then it adds the

2540
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
got night vision then it adds the
 

2541
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,589
got night vision then it adds the
redstone

2542
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
redstone
 

2543
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,150
redstone
and we get extended fermented spider eye

2544
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,160
and we get extended fermented spider eye
 

2545
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,069
and we get extended fermented spider eye
it becomes invisibility and then finally

2546
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
it becomes invisibility and then finally
 

2547
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,950
it becomes invisibility and then finally
splash

2548
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
splash
 

2549
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,870
splash
and at every step of the brewing process

2550
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
and at every step of the brewing process
 

2551
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,790
and at every step of the brewing process
we can pull out the

2552
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
we can pull out the
 

2553
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,309
we can pull out the
potions however we want them and

2554
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
potions however we want them and
 

2555
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,990
potions however we want them and
some new potions got added to the game

2556
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,000
some new potions got added to the game
 

2557
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,349
some new potions got added to the game
after we built this so it doesn't

2558
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
after we built this so it doesn't
 

2559
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:51,990
after we built this so it doesn't
actually brew

2560
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
actually brew
 

2561
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,750
actually brew
everything anymore which is a bit

2562
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
everything anymore which is a bit
 

2563
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,030
everything anymore which is a bit
unfortunate

2564
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
unfortunate
 

2565
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,870
unfortunate
and then there's a main system here for

2566
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
and then there's a main system here for
 

2567
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,550
and then there's a main system here for
brewing the awkward potions if we flip

2568
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
brewing the awkward potions if we flip
 

2569
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,150
brewing the awkward potions if we flip
this up

2570
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
this up
 

2571
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,190
this up
it'll auto brew awkward potions and

2572
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
it'll auto brew awkward potions and
 

2573
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,109
it'll auto brew awkward potions and
we can fill the water bottles up over

2574
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
we can fill the water bottles up over
 

2575
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,109
we can fill the water bottles up over
here although that is totally

2576
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
here although that is totally
 

2577
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,430
here although that is totally
automated now that you can fill water

2578
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
automated now that you can fill water
 

2579
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,270
automated now that you can fill water
bottles with dispensers

2580
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
bottles with dispensers
 

2581
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,589

sand apparently
and then they end up back in here also

2762
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,160
and then they end up back in here also
 

2763
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,430
and then they end up back in here also
the menu item back

2764
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
the menu item back
 

2765
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,190
the menu item back
ends up back in here all right well that

2766
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
ends up back in here all right well that
 

2767
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,710
ends up back in here all right well that
was a little weird but thanks etho you

2768
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
was a little weird but thanks etho you
 

2769
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,550
was a little weird but thanks etho you
got me out of a jam there

2770
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
got me out of a jam there
 

2771
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,950
got me out of a jam there
so the recent redstone changes seem to

2772
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
so the recent redstone changes seem to
 

2773
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,309
so the recent redstone changes seem to
have broke this thing even

2774
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
have broke this thing even
 

2775
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,309
have broke this thing even
further it's it's like getting stuck and

2776
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:26,319
further it's it's like getting stuck and
 

2777
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,510
further it's it's like getting stuck and
stuff now

2778
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
stuff now
 

2779
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,270
stuff now
so we might eventually tear this thing

2780
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
so we might eventually tear this thing
 

2781
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,190
so we might eventually tear this thing
out but the way it worked is it would

2782
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,200
out but the way it worked is it would
 

2783
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,750
out but the way it worked is it would
take an item out of the shulker boxes

2784
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
take an item out of the shulker boxes
 

2785
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,270
take an item out of the shulker boxes
and then match it with the

2786
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
and then match it with the
 

2787
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,870
and then match it with the
item from the menu it would put this

2788
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
item from the menu it would put this
 

2789
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,390
item from the menu it would put this
into an item filter

2790
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
into an item filter
 

2791
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,390
into an item filter
and if any items from the shulker box

2792
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
and if any items from the shulker box
 

2793
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,630

cave in future tours because it takes up

2936
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
cave in future tours because it takes up
 

2937
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,829
cave in future tours because it takes up
a big chunk of the time

2938

a big chunk of the time
 

2939
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,030
a big chunk of the time
uh so behind this door is a randomizer

2940
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
uh so behind this door is a randomizer

so that's the library where we were just

3216
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:19,119
so that's the library where we were just
 

3217
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,950
so that's the library where we were just
at um it's a little bit

3218
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
at um it's a little bit
 

3219
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,150
at um it's a little bit
chaotically arranged i would like just

3220
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
chaotically arranged i would like just
 

3221
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,829
chaotically arranged i would like just
build random things and you know they

3222
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:27,839
build random things and you know they
 

3223
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,349
build random things and you know they
wouldn't really match the theme or

3224
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
wouldn't really match the theme or
 

3225
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,190
wouldn't really match the theme or
anything so they got like snow mixed

with
 

3229
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,630
with
forest and sand all over the place

3230
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
forest and sand all over the place
 

3231
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,390
forest and sand all over the place
doesn't make a lot of sense so uh

3232
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
doesn't make a lot of sense so uh
 

3233
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,230
doesn't make a lot of sense so uh
doesn't have a lot of cohesion to it but

3234
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
doesn't have a lot of cohesion to it but
 

3235
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,150
doesn't have a lot of cohesion to it but
uh you know it's our world we've gotten

3236
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
uh you know it's our world we've gotten
 

3237
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,349
uh you know it's our world we've gotten
used to it

3238
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:41,359
used to it
 

3239
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,190
used to it

i needed some kind of beacon

3244
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
i needed some kind of beacon
 

3245
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,670
i needed some kind of beacon
back before beacons were in the game so

3246
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
back before beacons were in the game so
 

3247
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,390
back before beacons were in the game so
i

3248
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
i
 

3249
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,230
i
put a giant snowflake in the sky and i

3250
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,240
put a giant snowflake in the sky and i
 

3251
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,309
put a giant snowflake in the sky and i
could see it from a long distance and i

3252
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
could see it from a long distance and i
 

3253
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,870
could see it from a long distance and i
stopped getting lost around our base

3254
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
stopped getting lost around our base
 

3255
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,990
stopped getting lost around our base
then

3256
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
then
 

3257
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,109
then
because remember we were living

3258
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
because remember we were living
 

3259
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,549
because remember we were living
underground so we had no structures

3260
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
underground so we had no structures
 

3261
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,309
underground so we had no structures
above here to help locate it either it

3262
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:02,319
above here to help locate it either it
 

3263
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:02,870
above here to help locate it either it
was really

3264
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:02,880
was really
 

3265
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,430
was really
really tough eventually we turned this

3266
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
really tough eventually we turned this
 

3267
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,109
really tough eventually we turned this
into an iron farm as well one of the old

3268

school designs
 

3271
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,670
school designs
this is in our spawn chunks so

3272
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
this is in our spawn chunks so
 

3273
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,630
this is in our spawn chunks so
it would run all the time am i gonna die

3274
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:14,640
it would run all the time am i gonna die
 

3275

iron golems would fall down here and

3278
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
iron golems would fall down here and
 

3279
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,589
iron golems would fall down here and
then the lava would kill them

3280
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
then the lava would kill them
 

3281
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,109
then the lava would kill them
which i think i removed

3282
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119

 

3283

default so this was our mine shaft one
 

3365
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,030
default so this was our mine shaft one
of our first projects in the world

3366

to
 

3375
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,030
to
from our base and it's a pretty long

3376
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,040
from our base and it's a pretty long
 

3377
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,710
from our base and it's a pretty long
tunnel actually

3378
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720
tunnel actually
 

3379
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,549
tunnel actually
we had like a snowman walking around the

we had a way of converting boats into
 

3395
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,870
we had a way of converting boats into
planks it used to be a trick you could

3396
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
planks it used to be a trick you could
 

3397
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,510
planks it used to be a trick you could
do

so you could turn like jungle logs into
 

3401
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,030
so you could turn like jungle logs into
oak planks that way

3402

and again kind of like the tree farm at
 

3405
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,390
and again kind of like the tree farm at
our base we

3406
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
our base we
 

3407
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,030
our base we
dedicated a mine shaft to people that

3408
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
dedicated a mine shaft to people that
 

3409
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,390
dedicated a mine shaft to people that
donated and this is how i used to get

3410
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
donated and this is how i used to get
 

3411
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,630
donated and this is how i used to get
most of my redstone before uh

3412
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
most of my redstone before uh
 

3413
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,270
most of my redstone before uh
speed mining was a thing and then we can

3414
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
speed mining was a thing and then we can
 

3415
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,190
speed mining was a thing and then we can
ride the rails back once we're done

3416
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
ride the rails back once we're done
 

3417
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,390
ride the rails back once we're done
mining

3418
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400

 

3419
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,309

oh and it still works look at that cool

3420
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:36,319
oh and it still works look at that cool
 

3421
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,670
oh and it still works look at that cool
and then when we wanted to get out we

3422
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
and then when we wanted to get out we
 

3423
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,549
and then when we wanted to get out we
could enter pearl through the lily pads

3424
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
could enter pearl through the lily pads
 

3425
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,950
could enter pearl through the lily pads
oh that also still works oh cool uh-huh

3426
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
oh that also still works oh cool uh-huh
 

3427
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,069
oh that also still works oh cool uh-huh
so going back to

3428
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
so going back to
 

3429
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,069
so going back to
the whole using boats for transportation

3430
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
the whole using boats for transportation
 

3431
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,910
the whole using boats for transportation
thing you'll see we got a lot of water

3432
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:47,920
thing you'll see we got a lot of water
 

3433
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,589
thing you'll see we got a lot of water
around our base and we actually have

3434
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
around our base and we actually have
 

3435
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,630
around our base and we actually have
like

3436
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
like
 

3437
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,390
like
probably a good thousand blocks of water

3438
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
probably a good thousand blocks of water
 

3439
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,470
probably a good thousand blocks of water
connected together

3440
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:54,480
connected together
 

3441
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,470
connected together
uh most of that is because i actually

3442
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
uh most of that is because i actually
 

3443
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,510
uh most of that is because i actually
carved out um

3444
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
carved out um
 

3445
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,990
carved out um
the river myself it's like man-made to a

3446
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
the river myself it's like man-made to a
 

3447
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,430
the river myself it's like man-made to a
certain extent and we

3448
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,440
certain extent and we
 

3449
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,670
certain extent and we
put trees along the banks so it looks a

3450
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:03,680
put trees along the banks so it looks a
 

3451
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,549
put trees along the banks so it looks a
bit nicer

3452
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
bit nicer
 

3453
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,789
bit nicer
could ride our boat through here made a

3454
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
could ride our boat through here made a
 

3455
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:07,829
could ride our boat through here made a
fake waterfall

3456
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:07,839
fake waterfall
 

3457
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,710
fake waterfall
there and then it we joined it up to

3458
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
there and then it we joined it up to
 

3459
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,109
there and then it we joined it up to
this

3460
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:11,119
this
 

3461
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,990
this
lake where we got the you've been ethod

thing
 

3465
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,190
thing
this is a throwback to the minecraft

00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
this is a throwback to the minecraft
 

3467
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,910
this is a throwback to the minecraft
days

3468
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
days
 

3469
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,950
days
um it was b-dubs that verbalized the

sort of thing
 

3477
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,510
sort of thing
um and then someone turned it into an

00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520
um and then someone turned it into an
 

3479
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,030
um and then someone turned it into an
animated gift and i like

oh you guys remember the diamond door i
did a big thing where i teased people

3494
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,160
did a big thing where i teased people
 

3495
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,589
did a big thing where i teased people
that we were gonna open it and then i

3496
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
that we were gonna open it and then i
 

3497
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,430
that we were gonna open it and then i
would never open it i did that for so

3498
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
would never open it i did that for so
 

3499
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,710
would never open it i did that for so
many episodes

3500
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
many episodes
 

3501
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,150
many episodes
then eventually i opened it and there

3502
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,160
then eventually i opened it and there
 

3503
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,470
then eventually i opened it and there
was another door behind it and that just

3504
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
was another door behind it and that just
 

3505
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,710
was another door behind it and that just
that just got people so bad and then

3506
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,720
that just got people so bad and then
 

3507
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,789
that just got people so bad and then
eventually we did open this and you can

3508
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
eventually we did open this and you can
 

3509
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,270
eventually we did open this and you can
see the reveal for that on episode 404

3510
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
see the reveal for that on episode 404
 

3511
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:01,670
see the reveal for that on episode 404
if you're

3512
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
if you're
 

3513
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,670
if you're
curious there's like a special episode

3514
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
curious there's like a special episode
 

3515
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,789
curious there's like a special episode
as well

3516
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
as well
 

3517
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,710
as well
um and then eventually we actually did

3518
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
um and then eventually we actually did
 

3519
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,990
um and then eventually we actually did
put something behind here it's

3520
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
put something behind here it's
 

3521
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,349
put something behind here it's
our redstone room if we want to a

3522
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:11,359
our redstone room if we want to a
 

3523
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,270
our redstone room if we want to a
redstone project it's like a safe place

3524
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
redstone project it's like a safe place
 

3525
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:13,750
redstone project it's like a safe place
to

3526
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:13,760
to
 

3527
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,910
to
work with a nice flat area so at one

3528
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
work with a nice flat area so at one
 

3529
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,990
work with a nice flat area so at one
point in the series i got this idea that

3530
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
point in the series i got this idea that
 

3531
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,150
point in the series i got this idea that
we're gonna do biome enhancement

3532
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
we're gonna do biome enhancement
 

3533
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,549
we're gonna do biome enhancement
um so like the swamp biome we built a

3534
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
um so like the swamp biome we built a
 

3535
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,990
um so like the swamp biome we built a
giant canopy over that

3536
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
giant canopy over that
 

3537
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,069
giant canopy over that
and we were trying to add mushrooms and

3538
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:26,079
and we were trying to add mushrooms and
 

3539
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,630
and we were trying to add mushrooms and
make it look like its own unique biome

3540
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
make it look like its own unique biome
 

3541
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,710
make it look like its own unique biome
uh same sort of deal with this desert we

3542
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
uh same sort of deal with this desert we
 

3543
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,109
uh same sort of deal with this desert we
had a big giant desert right next to the

3544
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119
had a big giant desert right next to the
 

3545
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,630
had a big giant desert right next to the
man cave

3546
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,640
man cave
 

3547
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,470
man cave
and it was just like a big flat yellow

3548
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
and it was just like a big flat yellow
 

3549
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,750
and it was just like a big flat yellow
patch and it's like i

3550
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:37,760
patch and it's like i
 

3551
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,430
patch and it's like i
want to make that look good somehow i

3552
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
want to make that look good somehow i
 

3553
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,670
want to make that look good somehow i
don't know how eventually i decided to

3554
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
don't know how eventually i decided to
 

3555
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,630
don't know how eventually i decided to
build a city next to it which we called

3556
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:44,640
build a city next to it which we called
 

3557
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,950
build a city next to it which we called
sandy city and it's still a work in

3558
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:46,960
sandy city and it's still a work in
 

3559
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,390
sandy city and it's still a work in
progress

3560
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
progress
 

3561
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,510
progress
has been for a long time uh

3562
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,520
has been for a long time uh
 

3563
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,950
has been for a long time uh
yeah the man cave's just right over here

3564
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
yeah the man cave's just right over here
 

3565
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,870
yeah the man cave's just right over here
we got a gate to get into sandy city

3566
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
we got a gate to get into sandy city
 

3567
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,630
we got a gate to get into sandy city
and i think let's just test this out

3568
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
and i think let's just test this out
 

3569
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,470
and i think let's just test this out
there's a switch that activates if we

3570
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,480
there's a switch that activates if we
 

3571
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,470
there's a switch that activates if we
got frostwalker on

3572
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,480
got frostwalker on
 

3573
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,030
got frostwalker on
i think there we go

3574
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
i think there we go
 

3575
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,150
i think there we go
gate automatically opens up oh we fall

3576
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
gate automatically opens up oh we fall
 

3577
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,470
gate automatically opens up oh we fall
down

3578
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
down
 

3579
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,589
down
and then automatically closes that gets

3580
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:11,599
and then automatically closes that gets
 

3581
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,430
and then automatically closes that gets
us entry into the city um

3582
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,440
us entry into the city um
 

3583
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,390
us entry into the city um
so we had this building here for a very

3584
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
so we had this building here for a very
 

3585
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,309
so we had this building here for a very
long time

3586
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
long time
 

3587
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,349
long time
um wasn't super happy with the way it

3588
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
um wasn't super happy with the way it
 

3589
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,069
um wasn't super happy with the way it
looked and it discouraged me from

3590
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:24,079
looked and it discouraged me from
 

3591
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,910
looked and it discouraged me from
building more houses here so

3592
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
building more houses here so
 

3593
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,430
building more houses here so
this is all we had for a long time it's

3594
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
this is all we had for a long time it's
 

3595
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,270
this is all we had for a long time it's
not really done either there's no

3596
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
not really done either there's no
 

3597
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,710
not really done either there's no
interiors

3598
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:30,720
interiors
 

3599
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,549
interiors
to speak of there's a bad

3600
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
to speak of there's a bad
 

3601
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,230
to speak of there's a bad
uh but then eventually i decided to

3602
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
uh but then eventually i decided to
 

3603
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,670
uh but then eventually i decided to
change the style a little bit and we got

3604
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
change the style a little bit and we got
 

3605
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,390
change the style a little bit and we got
the stripped

3606
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
the stripped
 

3607
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,950
the stripped
uh wood in the game as well that made a

3608
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:40,960
uh wood in the game as well that made a
 

3609

gate this direction there's not a lot of

3700
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
gate this direction there's not a lot of
 

3701

we do have a weird contraption for
 

3705
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,710
we do have a weird contraption for
turning uh

3706
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
turning uh
 

3707
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,470

yellow sand into orange sand there was a

3708
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:22,480
yellow sand into orange sand there was a
 

3709
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,910
yellow sand into orange sand there was a
way of doing that for a while but it's

3710
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
way of doing that for a while but it's
 

3711
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,589
way of doing that for a while but it's
been patched out of the game now

3712
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
been patched out of the game now
 

3713
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,750
been patched out of the game now
it's a redstone contraption a little bit

3714
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:27,760
it's a redstone contraption a little bit
 

3715
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,230
it's a redstone contraption a little bit
cheaty but not super cheaty

3716
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240
cheaty but not super cheaty
 

3717
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,589
cheaty but not super cheaty
and then it would go down there um

3718
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
and then it would go down there um
 

3719
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,510
and then it would go down there um
the plan is to maybe eventually expand

3720
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
the plan is to maybe eventually expand
 

3721
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,109
the plan is to maybe eventually expand
out to the mountains that these paths

3722
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
out to the mountains that these paths
 

3723
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,710
out to the mountains that these paths
are for we do have

3724
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
are for we do have
 

3725
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,309
are for we do have
a couple things built up here we got a

3726
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
a couple things built up here we got a
 

3727
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,109
a couple things built up here we got a
woolly mammoth

3728
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
woolly mammoth
 

3729
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,030
woolly mammoth
woolly mammoth hanging out up here along

3730
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,040
woolly mammoth hanging out up here along
 

3731
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,230
woolly mammoth hanging out up here along
with our penguin

3732
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
with our penguin
 

3733
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,069
with our penguin
and this is one of our main ice farms

3734
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
and this is one of our main ice farms
 

3735
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,309
and this is one of our main ice farms
for a long time um

3736
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
for a long time um
 

3737
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,230
for a long time um
a minecart runs underneath the pistons

3738
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
a minecart runs underneath the pistons
 

3739
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,230
a minecart runs underneath the pistons
and it pushes all the ice up

3740
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,240
and it pushes all the ice up
 

3741
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,789
and it pushes all the ice up
into a giant 10 by 10 by 10 cube of ice

3742
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:58,799
into a giant 10 by 10 by 10 cube of ice
 

3743
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,390
into a giant 10 by 10 by 10 cube of ice
so like a

3744
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:00,400
so like a
 

3745
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,630
so like a
thousand ice blocks i had to do the math

3746
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640
thousand ice blocks i had to do the math
 

3747
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,230
thousand ice blocks i had to do the math
when uh it's ready for a full harvest

3748
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
when uh it's ready for a full harvest
 

3749
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,230
when uh it's ready for a full harvest
which is pretty cool

3750
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
which is pretty cool
 

3751
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,230
which is pretty cool
and uh there's also one other little

3752
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:10,240
and uh there's also one other little
 

3753
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,230
and uh there's also one other little
thing here

3754
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
thing here
 

3755
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,430
thing here
oh yeah it's still here i don't think

3756
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
oh yeah it's still here i don't think
 

3757
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,789
oh yeah it's still here i don't think
this works now

3758
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799

 

3759
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,710

oh it might be oh there we go

3760
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:20,720
oh it might be oh there we go
 

3761
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,549

excellent so we're almost done with this

3768
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
excellent so we're almost done with this
 

3769
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,510
excellent so we're almost done with this
area i think it's worth checking out the

3770
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
area i think it's worth checking out the
 

3771
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,589
area i think it's worth checking out the
cactus farm here as well

3772
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
cactus farm here as well
 

3773
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,230
cactus farm here as well
this was a remake of an old old farm i

3774
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
this was a remake of an old old farm i
 

3775
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:34,950
this was a remake of an old old farm i
made

3776
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
made
 

3777
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,789
made
back before i even started youtube i had

3778
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
back before i even started youtube i had
 

3779
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,950
back before i even started youtube i had
like three worlds before the chocolate

3780
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
like three worlds before the chocolate
 

3781
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,630
like three worlds before the chocolate
island one there

3782
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:40,640
island one there
 

3783
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,829
island one there
so i've been playing this game for a

3784
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
so i've been playing this game for a
 

3785
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,069
so i've been playing this game for a
long time uh originally this was made a

3786
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
long time uh originally this was made a
 

3787
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,270
long time uh originally this was made a
cobblestone though

3788
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
cobblestone though
 

3789
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,430
cobblestone though
and uh the cactus would fall down the

3790
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
and uh the cactus would fall down the
 

3791
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,270
and uh the cactus would fall down the
sides here into the streams

3792
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
sides here into the streams
 

3793
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,349
sides here into the streams
below i didn't know you could like block

3794
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
below i didn't know you could like block
 

3795
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,309
below i didn't know you could like block
water with signs at the time so i had to

3796
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:54,319
water with signs at the time so i had to
 

3797
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,710
water with signs at the time so i had to
calculate exact lengths for everything

3798
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
calculate exact lengths for everything
 

3799
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,910
calculate exact lengths for everything
for the water

3800
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:57,920
for the water
 

3801
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,589
for the water
make sure there was no dead zones with

3802
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
make sure there was no dead zones with
 

3803
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,990
make sure there was no dead zones with
it then i had a way of going down

3804
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
it then i had a way of going down
 

3805
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,390
it then i had a way of going down
here with pot lights uh to light up the

3806
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
here with pot lights uh to light up the
 

3807
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,029
here with pot lights uh to light up the
area

3808
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:05,039
area
 

3809
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,990
area
all the water would merge together and

3810
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
all the water would merge together and
 

3811
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,789
all the water would merge together and
uh

3812
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:08,799
uh
 

3813
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,349
uh
end up over here except without a hopper

3814
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:11,359
end up over here except without a hopper
 

3815
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,230
end up over here except without a hopper
i think when

3816
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
i think when
 

3817
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,829
i think when
clay got introduced into the game the

3818
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
clay got introduced into the game the
 

3819
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,069
clay got introduced into the game the
terra cotta i got like into a clay

3820
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
terra cotta i got like into a clay
 

3821
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,029
terra cotta i got like into a clay
phase i thought it looked amazing so we

3822
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
phase i thought it looked amazing so we
 

3823
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,150
phase i thought it looked amazing so we
built a road

3824
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
built a road
 

3825
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,950
built a road
uh that leads up to the library area and

3826
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
uh that leads up to the library area and
 

3827
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,630
uh that leads up to the library area and
every one of these lamps turn on at

3828
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
every one of these lamps turn on at
 

3829
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,069
every one of these lamps turn on at
night time they each have it their own

3830
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:26,079
night time they each have it their own
 

3831
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,430
night time they each have it their own
daylight sensor

3832
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
daylight sensor
 

3833
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,789
daylight sensor
good stuff let's keep on going here so

3834
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
good stuff let's keep on going here so
 

3835
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,309
good stuff let's keep on going here so
back when we started the biome

3836
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
back when we started the biome
 

3837
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,150
back when we started the biome
enhancement project my goal was to fill

3838
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
enhancement project my goal was to fill
 

3839
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,670
enhancement project my goal was to fill
up our world a bit more try to get it

3840
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
up our world a bit more try to get it
 

3841
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,390
up our world a bit more try to get it
looking

3842
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
looking
 

3843
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,430
looking
a bit nicer and fuller and i took huge

3844
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,440
a bit nicer and fuller and i took huge
 

3845
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,230
a bit nicer and fuller and i took huge
inspiration

3846
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
inspiration
 

3847
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,069
inspiration
from b double o he's uh he's a pretty

3848
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
from b double o he's uh he's a pretty
 

3849
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,710
from b double o he's uh he's a pretty
good builder he always had these

3850
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
good builder he always had these
 

3851
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,230
good builder he always had these
different areas in his world and he

3852
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
different areas in his world and he
 

3853
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,910
different areas in his world and he
would connect them together with paths

3854
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
would connect them together with paths
 

3855
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,910
would connect them together with paths
so i started putting paths in my world

3856
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
so i started putting paths in my world
 

3857
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,470
so i started putting paths in my world
as well

3858
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
as well
 

3859
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,069
as well
to connect the different areas together

3860
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
to connect the different areas together
 

3861
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,910
to connect the different areas together
and it just it helps so much

3862
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
and it just it helps so much
 

3863
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,670
and it just it helps so much
makes it feel more alive like

3864
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
makes it feel more alive like
 

3865
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,990
makes it feel more alive like
it's actually a lived-in world you know

3866
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
it's actually a lived-in world you know
 

3867
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,069
it's actually a lived-in world you know
um and also it just helps fill up space

3868
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
um and also it just helps fill up space
 

3869
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,789
um and also it just helps fill up space
and then along the paths we have fences

3870
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:04,799
and then along the paths we have fences
 

3871
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,510
and then along the paths we have fences
and uh

3872
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
and uh
 

3873
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,349
and uh
b-dubs was always big into making custom

3874
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:07,359
b-dubs was always big into making custom
 

3875
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,270
b-dubs was always big into making custom
trees so i started making custom trees

3876
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,280
trees so i started making custom trees
 

3877
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:09,990
trees so i started making custom trees
as well

3878
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
as well
 

3879
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,710
as well
got some dark oaks out here uh these are

3880
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,720
got some dark oaks out here uh these are
 

3881
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,309
got some dark oaks out here uh these are
like custom

3882
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
like custom
 

3883
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,510
like custom
like triple acacia trees mixed together

3884
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
like triple acacia trees mixed together
 

3885
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,150
like triple acacia trees mixed together
and then changed the wood type out uh

3886
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
and then changed the wood type out uh
 

3887
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,910
and then changed the wood type out uh
along with the biome enhancement project

3888
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
along with the biome enhancement project
 

3889
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,029
along with the biome enhancement project
we started uh

3890
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
we started uh
 

3891
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,870
we started uh
a giant wheat field over here this used

3892
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
a giant wheat field over here this used
 

3893
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,870
a giant wheat field over here this used
to be a planes biome

3894
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:26,880
to be a planes biome
 

3895
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,430
to be a planes biome
well it still is but now it's like a

3896
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
well it still is but now it's like a
 

3897
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,270
well it still is but now it's like a
little bit more interesting right we got

3898
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
little bit more interesting right we got
 

3899
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,309
little bit more interesting right we got
a dugout

3900
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
a dugout
 

3901
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,390
a dugout
there's a scarecrows in the field with

3902

hay bales there's a tractor
 

3905
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,190
hay bales there's a tractor
and the big thing here is the windmill

3906
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,200
and the big thing here is the windmill
 

3907
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,990
and the big thing here is the windmill
as well

as well
used to have a villager that lived in

3910
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
used to have a villager that lived in
 

3911
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,510
used to have a villager that lived in
there but he died eventually

3912
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:43,520
there but he died eventually
 

3913
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,950
there but he died eventually
it's almost like a common theme with

3914
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:44,960
it's almost like a common theme with
 

3915
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,190
it's almost like a common theme with
villagers they always seem to die

3916
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
villagers they always seem to die
 

3917
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,270
villagers they always seem to die
and from this lake we also have another

3918
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:49,280
and from this lake we also have another
 

3919
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,710
and from this lake we also have another
river that goes out this way

3920
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
river that goes out this way
 

3921
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,789
river that goes out this way
quite a ways that's a man-made one as

3922
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
quite a ways that's a man-made one as
 

3923
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,029
quite a ways that's a man-made one as
well we blew it out with tnt i think

3924
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:55,039
well we blew it out with tnt i think
 

3925
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,069
well we blew it out with tnt i think
and uh had to build a bridge over top of

3926
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
and uh had to build a bridge over top of
 

3927
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,910
and uh had to build a bridge over top of
it here in a path that goes up to

3928
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
it here in a path that goes up to
 

3929
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,309
it here in a path that goes up to
the you've been ethod um we line the

3930
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
the you've been ethod um we line the
 

3931
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,230
the you've been ethod um we line the
banks of the river with some stone like

3932
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
banks of the river with some stone like
 

3933
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,069
banks of the river with some stone like

basically
 

4047
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,510
basically
in the front here we have a hexy decimal

4048
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
in the front here we have a hexy decimal
 

4049

and sounds fancy basically what that

4052
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
and sounds fancy basically what that
 

4053
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,349
and sounds fancy basically what that
does is it takes two button presses

4054
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:19,359
does is it takes two button presses
 

4055

d i kind of got it laid out in the order

4072
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
d i kind of got it laid out in the order
 

4073

they are
 

4075
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,870
they are
and then we pull the lever here we

4076
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
and then we pull the lever here we
 

4077
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,230
and then we pull the lever here we
should get some dirts

4078
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,240
should get some dirts
 

4079
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,789
should get some dirts
delivered in the requested items or if

we drop it off
 

4093
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:06,309
we drop it off
here and it automatically gets sorted

here and it automatically gets sorted
and we're getting our dirt takes a bit

4096
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:07,839
and we're getting our dirt takes a bit
 

4097
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,510
and we're getting our dirt takes a bit
of time to get delivered that's the main

4098
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:09,520
of time to get delivered that's the main
 

4099
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:09,910
of time to get delivered that's the main
flaw

4100
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
flaw
 

4101
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,230
flaw
with this um and then if we want to

4102
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
with this um and then if we want to
 

4103
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,109
with this um and then if we want to
manually go

4104
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
manually go
 

4105
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,670
manually go
check out the storage room and and see

4106
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
check out the storage room and and see
 

4107
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,870
check out the storage room and and see
things we can go this way

4108
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
things we can go this way
 

4109
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,229
things we can go this way
this is where everything is actually

4110
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
this is where everything is actually
 

4111
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,149
this is where everything is actually
stored um

4112
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
stored um
 

4113
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,269

it's basically in sets of four oh

4114
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
it's basically in sets of four oh
 

4115
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,749
it's basically in sets of four oh
there's some saplings over here and

4116
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:25,759
there's some saplings over here and
 

4117
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,349
there's some saplings over here and
there's an upstairs to it we take the

4118
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:27,359
there's an upstairs to it we take the
 

4119
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,189
there's an upstairs to it we take the
water elevator to go up to the second

4120
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
water elevator to go up to the second
 

4121
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,030
water elevator to go up to the second
layer there's also two sides to it so

4122
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
layer there's also two sides to it so
 

4123
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,349
layer there's also two sides to it so
it's

4124
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:31,359
it's
 

4125
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,229
it's
absolutely massive like just a huge huge

4126
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
absolutely massive like just a huge huge
 

4127
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:38,149
absolutely massive like just a huge huge
project of course we built it on quartz

4128
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
project of course we built it on quartz
 

4129
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,829
project of course we built it on quartz
because why wouldn't we right let's make

4130
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
because why wouldn't we right let's make
 

4131
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,910
because why wouldn't we right let's make
it the cheapest thing in the world

4132
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:41,920
it the cheapest thing in the world
 

4133
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,070
it the cheapest thing in the world
and you can see the redstone from the

4134
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,080
and you can see the redstone from the
 

4135
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,229
and you can see the redstone from the
hexi decimal decoder it's a

4136
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
hexi decimal decoder it's a
 

4137
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,590
hexi decimal decoder it's a
a bit complicated let's go a game mode

4138
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:49,600
a bit complicated let's go a game mode
 

4139
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,229
a bit complicated let's go a game mode
spectator maybe for a second here

4140
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:52,239
spectator maybe for a second here
 

4141
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:55,829
spectator maybe for a second here
just get a full full idea of what we got

4142
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
just get a full full idea of what we got
 

4143
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,910
just get a full full idea of what we got
going on here

4144
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
going on here
 

4145
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,550
going on here
so yeah the wire branch is 256 different

4146
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:00,560
so yeah the wire branch is 256 different
 

4147
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,990
so yeah the wire branch is 256 different
ways

4148
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
ways
 

4149
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,309
ways
there's a whole bunch of stuff

4150
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319
there's a whole bunch of stuff
 

4151
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,149
there's a whole bunch of stuff
and then we got water streams that run

4152
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
and then we got water streams that run
 

4153
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:09,349
and then we got water streams that run
throughout the whole thing here these

4154
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
throughout the whole thing here these
 

4155
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,030
throughout the whole thing here these
are to put the items into the item

4156
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
are to put the items into the item
 

4157
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,189
are to put the items into the item
filters and sort things for us

4158
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
filters and sort things for us
 

4159
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,870
filters and sort things for us
um they also uh take items out of the

4160
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
um they also uh take items out of the
 

4161
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,390
um they also uh take items out of the
system and deliver them to us when we

4162
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
system and deliver them to us when we
 

4163
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,430
system and deliver them to us when we
request an item

4164
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
request an item
 

4165
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,269
request an item
right across from the nexus is another

4166
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
right across from the nexus is another
 

4167
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,430
right across from the nexus is another
one of our super important builds this

4168
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:23,440
one of our super important builds this
 

4169
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,349
one of our super important builds this
is our super smelter

4170
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
is our super smelter
 

4171
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,590
is our super smelter
the goal with this was to try see how

4172
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
the goal with this was to try see how
 

4173
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,269
the goal with this was to try see how
quickly we could actually smelt things

4174
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
quickly we could actually smelt things
 

4175
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,789
quickly we could actually smelt things
so we have

4176
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:30,799
so we have
 

4177
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,550
so we have
uh something that takes items out at

4178
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
uh something that takes items out at
 

4179
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,789
uh something that takes items out at
eight times hopper speed there

4180
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
eight times hopper speed there
 

4181
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,870
eight times hopper speed there
gets delivered to eight different mine

4182
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
gets delivered to eight different mine
 

4183
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,550
gets delivered to eight different mine
carts

4184
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:38,560
carts
 

4185
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,309
carts
those delivered to the furnaces i think

4186
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
those delivered to the furnaces i think
 

4187
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,870
those delivered to the furnaces i think
it's 128 furnaces or 256 i can't

4188
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
it's 128 furnaces or 256 i can't
 

4189
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,910
it's 128 furnaces or 256 i can't
remember

4190
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
remember
 

4191
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,309
remember
they spelt them spelting always takes 10

4192
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,319
they spelt them spelting always takes 10
 

4193
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,669
they spelt them spelting always takes 10
seconds though there's no way to avoid

4194
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
seconds though there's no way to avoid
 

4195
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:48,709
seconds though there's no way to avoid
that

4196
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
that
 

4197
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,349
that
and then it gets delivered here pretty

4198
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
and then it gets delivered here pretty
 

4199
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,950
and then it gets delivered here pretty
quickly

4200
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
quickly
 

4201
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,110
quickly
at three times hopper speed basically

4202
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
at three times hopper speed basically
 

4203
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,110
at three times hopper speed basically
and as you can imagine a smelting system

4204
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
and as you can imagine a smelting system
 

4205
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,030
and as you can imagine a smelting system
like that takes quite a bit of fuel and

4206
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
like that takes quite a bit of fuel and
 

4207
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,790
like that takes quite a bit of fuel and
that comes from our bamboozler

4208
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
that comes from our bamboozler
 

4209

also in this area we got started on
 

4237
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,550
also in this area we got started on
another new city where we're gonna build

another new city where we're gonna build
this is a more modern style one

4240
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
this is a more modern style one
 

4241
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,030
this is a more modern style one
uh supposed to house villagers and stuff

4242
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
uh supposed to house villagers and stuff
 

4243
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,430
uh supposed to house villagers and stuff
but i haven't got too far with it

4244
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
but i haven't got too far with it
 

4245
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,590
but i haven't got too far with it
but i got a lot of praise for the design

4246
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
but i got a lot of praise for the design
 

4247
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,790
but i got a lot of praise for the design
of it and the color scheme and

4248
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
of it and the color scheme and
 

4249
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,149
of it and the color scheme and
everything so we might continue on with

4250
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:46,159
everything so we might continue on with
 

4251
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,750
everything so we might continue on with
this people seem to like it

4252
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
this people seem to like it
 

4253
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,790
this people seem to like it
but it needs a lot of work obviously

4254
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
but it needs a lot of work obviously
 

4255
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,950
but it needs a lot of work obviously
i'm not super big on building but you

4256
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960

01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
we had to create
 

4315
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,310
we had to create
a bit of an ai for it because it's

4316
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
a bit of an ai for it because it's
 

4317
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,550
a bit of an ai for it because it's
actually a two-player game

4318
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,560
actually a two-player game
 

4319
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,790
actually a two-player game
so our redstone handles the second

4320
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
so our redstone handles the second

01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
secretly from us we have to try guess
 

4325
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,390

01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:04,400
that code
 

4327
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,270
that code
we use shulker boxes to do that which

4328
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
we use shulker boxes to do that which
 

4329
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,430
we use shulker boxes to do that which
have concrete powder inside

have concrete powder inside
 

4331
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,870
have concrete powder inside
that gets shot out and then we enter

4332
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:12,880
that gets shot out and then we enter
 

4333
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,950
that gets shot out and then we enter
a yes over here uh we stack

4334
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:16,960
a yes over here uh we stack
 

4335
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,270
a yes over here uh we stack
stack it up on the pistons we use

4336
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,280
stack it up on the pistons we use
 

4337
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,709
stack it up on the pistons we use

the colored pegs in the game there's six
 

4341
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,790
the colored pegs in the game there's six
different colors you play with

4342
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
different colors you play with
 

4343
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,550
different colors you play with
and then when you enter your answer you

4344
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
and then when you enter your answer you
 

4345
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,990
and then when you enter your answer you
jump

4346
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,000

one set of concrete goes down below and

4348
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:29,920
one set of concrete goes down below and
 

4349
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,750
one set of concrete goes down below and
gets converted to item form and then it

4350
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
gets converted to item form and then it
 

4351
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,070
gets converted to item form and then it
gets matched with the

4352
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
gets matched with the
 

4353
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,229
gets matched with the
the secret code there to see what

4354
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
the secret code there to see what
 

4355
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,830
the secret code there to see what
matches and what doesn't

4356
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
matches and what doesn't
 

4357
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,830
matches and what doesn't
and then the result gets displayed on

4358
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
and then the result gets displayed on
 

4359
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,229
and then the result gets displayed on
the side panels here

4360
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
the side panels here
 

4361
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,110
the side panels here
this one never got finished and yeah

4362
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
this one never got finished and yeah
 

4363
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,630
this one never got finished and yeah
it's kind of hard to explain it but

4364
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
it's kind of hard to explain it but
 

4365
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,149
it's kind of hard to explain it but
it's it's a pretty cool game if we ever

4366
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
it's it's a pretty cool game if we ever
 

4367
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,149
it's it's a pretty cool game if we ever
get it finished aha

4368
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:50,159
get it finished aha
 

4369
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,070
get it finished aha
so also in this area we have another

4370
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
so also in this area we have another
 

4371
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,790
so also in this area we have another
pretty major farm it's a dual farm

4372
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:54,800
pretty major farm it's a dual farm
 

4373
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,350
pretty major farm it's a dual farm
so this main area in the center is for

4374
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
so this main area in the center is for
 

4375
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,630
so this main area in the center is for
pumpkins

4376
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
pumpkins
 

4377
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,229
pumpkins
they grow and then they automatically

4378
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
they grow and then they automatically
 

4379
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,149
they grow and then they automatically
get harvested when they

4380
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
get harvested when they
 

4381
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,750
get harvested when they
grow underneath the block there gets

4382
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:03,760
grow underneath the block there gets
 

4383
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,430
grow underneath the block there gets
detected and a piston

4384
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440
detected and a piston
 

4385
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,430
detected and a piston
breaks them they all get delivered down

4386
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
breaks them they all get delivered down
 

4387
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,030
breaks them they all get delivered down
in the chests here

4388
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
in the chests here
 

4389
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,470
in the chests here
and then we can use those for trading

4390
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
and then we can use those for trading
 

4391
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,709
and then we can use those for trading
with villagers if we want

4392
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
with villagers if we want
 

4393
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,950
with villagers if we want
but also we got the brown mushroom farm

4394
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:14,960
but also we got the brown mushroom farm
 

4395
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,510
but also we got the brown mushroom farm
on the side that goes all around this

4396
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
on the side that goes all around this
 

4397
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,390
on the side that goes all around this
and the way this works is there's

4398
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
and the way this works is there's
 

4399
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,229
and the way this works is there's
actually

4400
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:22,239
actually
 

4401
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,630
actually
um can we see them there's mushrooms

4402
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:24,640
um can we see them there's mushrooms
 

4403
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,510
um can we see them there's mushrooms
beside that

4404
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
beside that
 

4405
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,590
beside that
in the dark four of them so we'll

4406
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
in the dark four of them so we'll
 

4407
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,350
in the dark four of them so we'll
automatically grow a mushroom here over

4408
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
automatically grow a mushroom here over
 

4409
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:29,910
automatically grow a mushroom here over
time

4410
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:29,920
time
 

4411
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,070
time
we don't have to plant it ourself and

4412
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
we don't have to plant it ourself and
 

4413
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,510
we don't have to plant it ourself and
then you hit the

4414
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
then you hit the
 

4415
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,709
then you hit the
button to grow

4416
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
button to grow
 

4417
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,149
button to grow
that dispenses bone meal to all the

4418
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
that dispenses bone meal to all the
 

4419
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,630
that dispenses bone meal to all the
mushrooms it goes all the way around

4420
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640
mushrooms it goes all the way around
 

4421
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,830
mushrooms it goes all the way around
and then we harvest it with our axe

4422
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
and then we harvest it with our axe
 

4423
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,630
and then we harvest it with our axe
running along here an instant break with

4424
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
running along here an instant break with
 

4425
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,750
running along here an instant break with
efficiency

4426
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
efficiency
 

4427
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,110
efficiency
and then after we harvest it all we

4428
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
and then after we harvest it all we
 

4429
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,870
and then after we harvest it all we
press that and water comes down and

4430
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
press that and water comes down and
 

4431
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,550
press that and water comes down and
pushes all the blocks to the middle

4432
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
pushes all the blocks to the middle
 

4433
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,470
pushes all the blocks to the middle
next to our big giant wheat field we

4434
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,480
next to our big giant wheat field we
 

4435
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,550
next to our big giant wheat field we
have a village that generated in a

4436
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
have a village that generated in a
 

4437

plains biome this was an original
 

4439
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,990
plains biome this was an original
testificat village

4440
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
testificat village
 

4441
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,630

built fences around the area we put
 

4447
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,990
built fences around the area we put
lamps in there to keep it nice and

4448
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
lamps in there to keep it nice and
 

4449

and they survived in here for a very
 

4453
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,910
and they survived in here for a very
long time but i think they all

4454
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
long time but i think they all
 

4455
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,470
long time but i think they all
officially died now

4456
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
officially died now
 

4457
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,750

through there
 

4477
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,590
through there
and uh let's see oh

4478
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,600
and uh let's see oh
 

4479
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,270
and uh let's see oh
that's where they are

4480

mind i built a beacon there and then i
 

4485
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,390
mind i built a beacon there and then i
emptied

4486
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:50,400
emptied
 

4487
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,070
emptied
out the iron and i guess that's where

4488
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
out the iron and i guess that's where
 

4489
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,510
out the iron and i guess that's where
they ended up

4490
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
they ended up

and then uh right between the wheat

4494
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,320
and then uh right between the wheat
 

4495
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,870
and then uh right between the wheat
field and the village we built a path

4496
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
field and the village we built a path
 

4497
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,350

with a bow or something it shoots arrows
at the top those land and hit the seeds

4530
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:35,360
at the top those land and hit the seeds
 

4531
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,070
at the top those land and hit the seeds
which pop

4532
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
which pop
 

4533
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,030
which pop
off so that we have enough to replant

4534
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
off so that we have enough to replant
 

4535
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,870
off so that we have enough to replant
this when we harvest it we hit one of

4536
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
this when we harvest it we hit one of
 

4537
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,630
this when we harvest it we hit one of
these buttons

4538
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
these buttons
 

4539
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,870
these buttons
that sends out water to harvest whatever

4540
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
that sends out water to harvest whatever
 

4541
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,990
that sends out water to harvest whatever
is left

4542
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,000
is left
 

4543
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,590
is left
to create the coarse fruit it all gets

4544
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
to create the coarse fruit it all gets
 

4545
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,830
to create the coarse fruit it all gets
washed down into a middle channel here

4546
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
washed down into a middle channel here
 

4547
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,950
washed down into a middle channel here
and it's incredibly laggy

4548
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:54,960
and it's incredibly laggy
 

4549
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,430
and it's incredibly laggy
then the seeds get sorted out and end up

4550
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
then the seeds get sorted out and end up
 

4551
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,910
then the seeds get sorted out and end up
in this chest so we can replant

4552
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
in this chest so we can replant
 

4553
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,990
in this chest so we can replant
water automatically goes away on its own

4554
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
water automatically goes away on its own
 

4555
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,950
water automatically goes away on its own
too

4556
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:02,960
too
 

4557
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,149
too
we have a bit of a path here with some

4558
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:06,159
we have a bit of a path here with some
 

4559
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,189
we have a bit of a path here with some
extra tall acacia trees give us some

4560
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
extra tall acacia trees give us some
 

4561
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,790
extra tall acacia trees give us some
cover from the sun

4562
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:10,800
cover from the sun
 

4563
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,390
cover from the sun
and then this leads over to the

4564
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
and then this leads over to the
 

4565
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,229
and then this leads over to the
blacksmith building

this stuff but yeah that chorus fruit
ends up in the furnaces and then

4586
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
ends up in the furnaces and then
 

4587
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,709
ends up in the furnaces and then
it smelts and we can make purple out of

4588
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
it smelts and we can make purple out of
 

4589
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:37,270
it smelts and we can make purple out of
the

4590
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
the
 

4591
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,790
the
fruit just like so

4592
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:42,800

 

4593
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,790

awesome so we are just about done with

4594
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
awesome so we are just about done with
 

4595
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,390
awesome so we are just about done with
the main area we just got a couple more

4596
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
the main area we just got a couple more
 

4597
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,510
the main area we just got a couple more
builds and then we're going to head off

4598
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,520
builds and then we're going to head off
 

4599
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,470
builds and then we're going to head off
to the nether and

4600
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
to the nether and
 

4601
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,470
to the nether and
check out some of our farther away stuff

4602
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,480
check out some of our farther away stuff
 

4603
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,030
check out some of our farther away stuff
so first off the guardian farm

4604
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
so first off the guardian farm
 

4605
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,709
so first off the guardian farm
we've been working on this more recently

4606
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
we've been working on this more recently
 

4607
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,630
we've been working on this more recently
but originally we built this guardian

4608
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
but originally we built this guardian
 

4609
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,350
but originally we built this guardian
farm

4610
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
farm
 

4611
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,310
farm
in 1.8 when guardians came out uh it

4612
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
in 1.8 when guardians came out uh it
 

4613
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,149
in 1.8 when guardians came out uh it
just so happens my world

4614
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
just so happens my world
 

4615
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,070
just so happens my world
there was a guardian farm underground

4616
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
there was a guardian farm underground
 

4617
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,990
there was a guardian farm underground
here because

4618
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
here because
 

4619
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,550
here because
a little hard to explain but my world

4620
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
a little hard to explain but my world
 

4621
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,470
a little hard to explain but my world
was generated before jungles were even

4622
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:10,480
was generated before jungles were even
 

4623
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,070
was generated before jungles were even
in the game and once i think they added

4624
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:12,080
in the game and once i think they added
 

4625
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,270
in the game and once i think they added
jungles they changed

4626
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,280
jungles they changed
 

4627
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,390
jungles they changed
how seeds generates like the which

4628
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:16,400
how seeds generates like the which
 

4629
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,149
how seeds generates like the which
biomes go where

4630
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
biomes go where
 

4631
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,229
biomes go where
so if you generate my world now with the

4632
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
so if you generate my world now with the
 

4633
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,350
so if you generate my world now with the
same seed

4634
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
same seed
 

4635
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,790
same seed
this is actually ocean where we're

4636
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
this is actually ocean where we're
 

4637
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,950
this is actually ocean where we're
standing and there's a guardian farm

4638
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:24,960
standing and there's a guardian farm
 

4639
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,590
standing and there's a guardian farm
right in this area so if i mined out the

4640
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
right in this area so if i mined out the
 

4641
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,630
right in this area so if i mined out the
ground

4642
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
ground
 

4643
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,110
ground
and put water there with spawn guardians

4644
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
and put water there with spawn guardians
 

4645
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,550
and put water there with spawn guardians
and that's what we did

4646
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:32,560
and that's what we did
 

4647
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,669
and that's what we did
and uh recently we added a mural telling

4648
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:35,679
and uh recently we added a mural telling
 

4649
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,910
and uh recently we added a mural telling
the story about the elder guardian we

4650
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:37,920
the story about the elder guardian we
 

4651
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,590
the story about the elder guardian we
put on top the windmill

4652
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
put on top the windmill
 

4653
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,390
put on top the windmill
got a mini guardian temple there we

4654
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
got a mini guardian temple there we
 

4655
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,990
got a mini guardian temple there we
transported the elder guardian through

4656
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
transported the elder guardian through
 

4657
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,950
transported the elder guardian through
the nether and stashed him on top the

4658
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:46,960
the nether and stashed him on top the
 

4659
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,550
the nether and stashed him on top the
windmill

4660
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
windmill
 

4661
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,310
windmill
where he later despawned for reasons we

4662
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
where he later despawned for reasons we
 

4663
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,149
where he later despawned for reasons we
don't know

4664
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:52,159
don't know
 

4665
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,990
don't know
aha so uh if we go down over here this

4666
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
aha so uh if we go down over here this
 

4667
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,189
aha so uh if we go down over here this
is where the actual killing

4668
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:57,199
is where the actual killing
 

4669
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,630
is where the actual killing
chamber and storage is for it all down

4670
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:00,640
chamber and storage is for it all down
 

4671
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,430
chamber and storage is for it all down
and here they are they're constantly

4672
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
and here they are they're constantly
 

4673
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,709
and here they are they're constantly
getting burnt

4674
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
getting burnt
 

4675
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,550
getting burnt
stuff automatically gets sorted into the

4676
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:06,560
stuff automatically gets sorted into the
 

4677
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,550
stuff automatically gets sorted into the
chest

4678
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,560
chest
 

4679
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,669
chest
as you would expect and then

4680
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
as you would expect and then
 

4681
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,990
as you would expect and then
cook stuff there when i craft stuff i

4682
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
cook stuff there when i craft stuff i
 

4683
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,229
cook stuff there when i craft stuff i
store it over here

4684
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
store it over here
 

4685
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,669
store it over here
um and then there's a manual

4686
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
um and then there's a manual
 

4687
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:24,070
um and then there's a manual
kill mode i think that gets rid of lava

4688
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080

 

4689
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,510

and there's also a way of sending them

4690
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
and there's also a way of sending them
 

4691
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,189
and there's also a way of sending them
to the nether

4692
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
to the nether
 

4693
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,550
to the nether
yeah let's go check out the nether thing

4694
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
yeah let's go check out the nether thing
 

4695
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,310
yeah let's go check out the nether thing
actually so when we hit that

4696
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
actually so when we hit that
 

4697
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,149
actually so when we hit that
switch to go to the nether it makes a

4698
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
switch to go to the nether it makes a
 

4699
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,910
switch to go to the nether it makes a
water bucket come out here

4700
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
water bucket come out here
 

4701
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,790
water bucket come out here
and pistons extend so they can't go down

4702
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
and pistons extend so they can't go down
 

4703
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,310
and pistons extend so they can't go down
anymore and they just funnel through the

4704
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
anymore and they just funnel through the
 

4705
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,070
anymore and they just funnel through the
nether portal

4706
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
nether portal
 

4707
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,390
nether portal
let's go creative

4708
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
let's go creative
 

4709
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,790
let's go creative
let's go back to the spectator oh

4710
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
let's go back to the spectator oh
 

4711
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,750
let's go back to the spectator oh
snappers

4712
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
snappers
 

4713
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,390
snappers
they end up in this uh chamber here

4714
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
they end up in this uh chamber here
 

4715
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,830
they end up in this uh chamber here
where we used to kill them with instant

4716
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
where we used to kill them with instant
 

4717
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,510
where we used to kill them with instant
damage potions and stuff

4718
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
damage potions and stuff
 

4719
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,350
damage potions and stuff
uh now that mob cramming's a thing in

4720
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
uh now that mob cramming's a thing in
 

4721
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,870
uh now that mob cramming's a thing in
the game we can't store like

4722
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
the game we can't store like
 

4723
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,550
the game we can't store like
200 300 here like we used to

4724
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:00,560
200 300 here like we used to
 

4725
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,669
200 300 here like we used to
so it's not really used anymore

4726
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
so it's not really used anymore
 

4727
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,830
so it's not really used anymore
and something we worked on just last

4728
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
and something we worked on just last
 

4729
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,990
and something we worked on just last
episode actually is a new version of the

4730
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
episode actually is a new version of the
 

4731
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,910
episode actually is a new version of the
ender porter which is a system for

4732
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:09,920
ender porter which is a system for
 

4733
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,910
ender porter which is a system for
teleporting large distances in your

4734
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
teleporting large distances in your
 

4735
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,790
teleporting large distances in your
world

4736
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:12,800
world
 

4737
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,189
world
you can store ender pearls on bubble

4738
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
you can store ender pearls on bubble
 

4739
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,189
you can store ender pearls on bubble
columns now very easily

4740
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
columns now very easily
 

4741
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,950
columns now very easily
and then you use redstone to trigger

4742
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
and then you use redstone to trigger
 

4743
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,189
and then you use redstone to trigger
another one of these

4744
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
another one of these
 

4745
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,709
another one of these
at another area in your world that you

4746
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
at another area in your world that you
 

4747
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,390
at another area in your world that you
want to teleport to so if you look at

4748
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
want to teleport to so if you look at
 

4749
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,470
want to teleport to so if you look at
our coordinates we're at minus 240

4750
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
our coordinates we're at minus 240
 

4751
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,669
our coordinates we're at minus 240
700 we hit the button that triggers the

4752
01:19:29,669 --> 01:19:29,679
700 we hit the button that triggers the
 

4753
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:30,390
700 we hit the button that triggers the
ender pearl

4754
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
ender pearl
 

4755
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,550
ender pearl
at our other base location here at our

4756
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
at our other base location here at our
 

4757
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,590
at our other base location here at our
stronghold

4758
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
stronghold
 

4759
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,630
stronghold
and now we're at minus 470 and 850 so we

4760
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
and now we're at minus 470 and 850 so we
 

4761
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,550
and now we're at minus 470 and 850 so we
traveled a long distance there

4762
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
traveled a long distance there
 

4763
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,229
traveled a long distance there
we set up another end of pearl for next

4764
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:40,239
we set up another end of pearl for next
 

4765
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,149
we set up another end of pearl for next
time we want to teleport

4766
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
time we want to teleport
 

4767
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:46,149
time we want to teleport
we can go back if we want to the temple

4768
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
we can go back if we want to the temple
 

4769
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,030
we can go back if we want to the temple
and let's go to the stronghold actually

4770
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,040
and let's go to the stronghold actually
 

4771
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,990
and let's go to the stronghold actually
because that's probably what we want to

4772
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,000
because that's probably what we want to
 

4773
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,070
because that's probably what we want to
see next

4774
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
see next
 

4775
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,990
see next
oh man we got so much stuff left to see

4776
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
oh man we got so much stuff left to see
 

4777
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,270
oh man we got so much stuff left to see
i thought we could do this tour in an

4778
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
i thought we could do this tour in an
 

4779
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,950
i thought we could do this tour in an
hour and a half but i know it's not

4780
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:56,960
hour and a half but i know it's not
 

4781
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,030
hour and a half but i know it's not
going to happen now

4782
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
going to happen now
 

4783
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,430
going to happen now
so at the stronghold base we've made

4784
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
so at the stronghold base we've made
 

4785
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,590
so at the stronghold base we've made
many attempts at starting new bases in

4786
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
many attempts at starting new bases in
 

4787
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,229
many attempts at starting new bases in
our world

4788
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:04,239
our world
 

4789
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:07,910
our world
we have a giant mob system here this is

4790
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
we have a giant mob system here this is
 

4791
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,669
we have a giant mob system here this is
an old-school version they kind of get

4792
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
an old-school version they kind of get
 

4793
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,270
an old-school version they kind of get
trapped in here now

4794
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
trapped in here now
 

4795
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,590
trapped in here now
it's not super good there's also a

4796
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:13,600
it's not super good there's also a
 

4797
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,350
it's not super good there's also a
lighting system with this so we can turn

4798
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360
lighting system with this so we can turn
 

4799
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,709
lighting system with this so we can turn
it on and off

4800
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:16,719
it on and off
 

4801
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:19,510
it on and off
we go flip this lever all the lights

4802
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:19,520
we go flip this lever all the lights
 

4803
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,070
we go flip this lever all the lights
turn on

4804
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
turn on
 

4805
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,390
turn on
oh i think we gotta do it to all the

4806
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
oh i think we gotta do it to all the
 

4807
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,669
oh i think we gotta do it to all the
torches actually

4808
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
torches actually
 

4809
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,430
torches actually
oh yeah it's not even controlled all

4810
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
oh yeah it's not even controlled all
 

4811
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,950
oh yeah it's not even controlled all
together

4812
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:26,960
together
 

4813
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,550
together
why didn't i put them all together uh oh

4814
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
why didn't i put them all together uh oh
 

4815
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,950
why didn't i put them all together uh oh
let's go spectator so yeah all the

4816
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
let's go spectator so yeah all the
 

4817
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,390
let's go spectator so yeah all the
lights are on here so they should stop

4818
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,400
lights are on here so they should stop
 

4819
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,430
lights are on here so they should stop
spawning

4820
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
spawning
 

4821
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,590
spawning
but otherwise they fall down into an

4822
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
but otherwise they fall down into an
 

4823
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,430
but otherwise they fall down into an
area here we have a mob

4824
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
area here we have a mob
 

4825
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,910
area here we have a mob
sorting system oh i think it does

4826
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
sorting system oh i think it does
 

4827
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,669
sorting system oh i think it does
actually work it's just messed up look

4828
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
actually work it's just messed up look
 

4829
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:44,550
actually work it's just messed up look
at the pistons

4830
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,560
at the pistons
 

4831
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,149
at the pistons
we got an arm out and the arms over

4832
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
we got an arm out and the arms over
 

4833
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,149
we got an arm out and the arms over
there i think we got to replace it for

4834
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:48,159
there i think we got to replace it for
 

4835
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,550
there i think we got to replace it for
some reason

4836
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
some reason
 

4837
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,070
some reason
i don't know why they broke or when

4838
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:54,080
i don't know why they broke or when
 

4839
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,149
i don't know why they broke or when
oh let's get that one back there so if

4840
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:56,159
oh let's get that one back there so if
 

4841
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,229
oh let's get that one back there so if
we do that then

4842
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
we do that then
 

4843
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,310
we do that then
creepers get stored to the left zombies

4844
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
creepers get stored to the left zombies
 

4845
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,390
creepers get stored to the left zombies
over there the baby guys

4846
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
over there the baby guys
 

4847
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,910
over there the baby guys
and then uh skeletons get one way

4848
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:05,920
and then uh skeletons get one way
 

4849
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,790
and then uh skeletons get one way
i think as we we uh squeezed them it

4850
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:08,800
i think as we we uh squeezed them it
 

4851
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,149
i think as we we uh squeezed them it
through too quickly there that got

4852
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:10,159
through too quickly there that got
 

4853
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,510
through too quickly there that got
messed up a bit

4854
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
messed up a bit
 

4855
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,510
messed up a bit
but uh there's also a system here for

4856
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
but uh there's also a system here for
 

4857
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,270
but uh there's also a system here for
making the skeletons shoot the creepers

4858
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
making the skeletons shoot the creepers
 

4859
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,390
making the skeletons shoot the creepers
and then they would

4860
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
and then they would
 

4861
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,270
and then they would
explode wherever we wanted them to down

4862
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
explode wherever we wanted them to down
 

4863
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,709
explode wherever we wanted them to down
over here somewhere

4864
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
over here somewhere
 

4865
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,750
over here somewhere
and uh there's also

4866
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
and uh there's also
 

4867
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,550
and uh there's also
a chamber here they used to land down

4868
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,560
a chamber here they used to land down
 

4869
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,070
a chamber here they used to land down
like creepers

4870
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
like creepers
 

4871
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,510
like creepers
zombies and skeletons would get

4872
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
zombies and skeletons would get
 

4873
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,910
zombies and skeletons would get
separated there uh the plan was to make

4874
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
separated there uh the plan was to make
 

4875
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,350
separated there uh the plan was to make
a base location over here

4876
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
a base location over here
 

4877
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,310
a base location over here
after the man cave long long time ago i

4878
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
after the man cave long long time ago i
 

4879
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,990
after the man cave long long time ago i
have a bad habit of not following

4880
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
have a bad habit of not following
 

4881
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,030
have a bad habit of not following
through with my

4882
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,040
through with my
 

4883
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,910
through with my
secondary bases though because we got so

4884
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,920
secondary bases though because we got so
 

4885
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,510
secondary bases though because we got so
much stuff at the man cave it's hard to

4886
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
much stuff at the man cave it's hard to
 

4887
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,790
much stuff at the man cave it's hard to
leave it behind

4888
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
leave it behind
 

4889
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,470
leave it behind
but yeah the plan with this was to build

4890
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
but yeah the plan with this was to build
 

4891
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,149
but yeah the plan with this was to build
our base above uh

4892
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:48,159
our base above uh
 

4893
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,310
our base above uh
end portal and silverfish farm we made a

4894
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,320
end portal and silverfish farm we made a
 

4895
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,149
end portal and silverfish farm we made a
silverfish farm by

4896
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
silverfish farm by
 

4897
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,390
silverfish farm by
detecting when they entered the blocks

4898
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
detecting when they entered the blocks
 

4899
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,870
detecting when they entered the blocks
and then we would generate new stone

4900
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
and then we would generate new stone
 

4901
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,470
and then we would generate new stone
blocks at a

4902
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
blocks at a
 

4903
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,229
blocks at a
stone generator over here with lava

4904
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:00,239
stone generator over here with lava
 

4905
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,750
stone generator over here with lava
above uh

4906
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
above uh
 

4907
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,790
above uh
then the silver fish blocks would get

4908
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
then the silver fish blocks would get
 

4909
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,709
then the silver fish blocks would get
funneled down a chain and stacked

4910
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
funneled down a chain and stacked
 

4911
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,790
funneled down a chain and stacked
together into a big block

4912
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:08,800
together into a big block
 

4913

and this was a way of storing xp back

4914
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
and this was a way of storing xp back
 

4915
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,350
and this was a way of storing xp back
before it was possible

4916

and do one enchantment so the idea was
 

4925
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,310
and do one enchantment so the idea was
to keep this constantly running while we

4926
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,320
to keep this constantly running while we
 

4927
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,310
to keep this constantly running while we
worked on our base uh we gotta go

4928

survival
 

4931
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,830
survival
and then when we were ready we would

4932
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
and then when we were ready we would
 

4933
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,430
and then when we were ready we would
harvest it and i think we used to have

4934
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
harvest it and i think we used to have
 

4935
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,510
harvest it and i think we used to have
like snow golems and

4936
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:31,520
like snow golems and
 

4937
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,550
like snow golems and
all kinds of stuff to get these guys out

4938
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
all kinds of stuff to get these guys out
 

4939
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,310
all kinds of stuff to get these guys out
of the blocks and then we started using

4940
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
of the blocks and then we started using
 

4941
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,550
of the blocks and then we started using
poison potions

4942
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
poison potions
 

4943
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,709
poison potions
and it creates like a runaway chain

4944
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
and it creates like a runaway chain
 

4945
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,390
and it creates like a runaway chain

this is a whole bunch of crazy wacky

4962
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
this is a whole bunch of crazy wacky
 

4963
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,790
this is a whole bunch of crazy wacky
stuff that

4964
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
stuff that
 

4965
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,350
stuff that
didn't make any sense oh i don't know

4966

what that does oh that lets them free
 

4969
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,870
what that does oh that lets them free
and there was also a tunnel that we

4970
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:10,880
and there was also a tunnel that we
 

4971
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,950
and there was also a tunnel that we
would transport them through

4972
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
would transport them through
 

4973
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,189
would transport them through
um they would walk on one side we would

4974
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
um they would walk on one side we would
 

4975
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,790
um they would walk on one side we would
be on the other side of glass

4976
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
be on the other side of glass
 

4977
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,550
be on the other side of glass
and we also got a couple other random

4978
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560
and we also got a couple other random
 

4979
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,149
and we also got a couple other random
builds nearby the stronghold

4980

builds nearby the stronghold
 

4981
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:21,910
builds nearby the stronghold
base that's probably worth mentioning

4982
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
base that's probably worth mentioning
 

4983
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,149
base that's probably worth mentioning
the ice tray this was like the original

4984
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:24,159
the ice tray this was like the original
 

4985

4987
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,669
ice farm
uh eventually this biome changed so

4988
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
uh eventually this biome changed so
 

4989
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,149
uh eventually this biome changed so
water doesn't freeze here anymore

4990
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:30,159
water doesn't freeze here anymore
 

4991
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,709
water doesn't freeze here anymore
but we had a whole system for like

4992
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
but we had a whole system for like
 

4993
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,030
but we had a whole system for like
seeding the ice blocks

4994
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,040
seeding the ice blocks
 

4995
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,310

pistons would go down or up we would put

4996
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
pistons would go down or up we would put
 

4997
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,310
pistons would go down or up we would put
them down when we wanted the

4998
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:40,320
them down when we wanted the
 

4999
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,070
them down when we wanted the
water buckets dispensed and that would

5000
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:42,080
water buckets dispensed and that would
 

5001
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,510
water buckets dispensed and that would
fill the area with water and then we'd

5002
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
fill the area with water and then we'd
 

5003
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,270
fill the area with water and then we'd
put the blocks up so it would freeze

5004
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
put the blocks up so it would freeze
 

5005
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,310
put the blocks up so it would freeze
faster

5006
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
faster
 

5007
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,070
faster
and then down when we wanted to harvest

5008
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,080
and then down when we wanted to harvest
 

5009
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,550
and then down when we wanted to harvest
the ice nearby here we also got the

5010
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
the ice nearby here we also got the
 

5011
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,330
the ice nearby here we also got the
zombie purifier

5012

we made a whole giant contraption here

5016
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:55,840
we made a whole giant contraption here
 

5017
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,870
we made a whole giant contraption here
for turning

5018
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
for turning
 

5019
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,510
for turning
zombie villagers into villagers there

5020

zombie villagers into villagers there
 

5021
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,070
zombie villagers into villagers there
was a zombie spawner back there uh

5022
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
was a zombie spawner back there uh
 

5023
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,590
was a zombie spawner back there uh
used to be able to get zombie villagers

5024
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
used to be able to get zombie villagers
 

5025

i know
 

5029
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,550
i know
um and then we had a lighting switch to

5030
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
um and then we had a lighting switch to
 

5031
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,990
um and then we had a lighting switch to
turn it on and off

5032
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,000
turn it on and off
 

5033
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,910
turn it on and off
and then there was a junction if we

5034
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
and then there was a junction if we
 

5035
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,430
and then there was a junction if we
wanted to send

5036
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
wanted to send
 

5037
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,110
wanted to send
the zombie villagers to the curing

5038
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
the zombie villagers to the curing
 

5039
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,550
the zombie villagers to the curing
stations they would land down here

5040
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
stations they would land down here
 

5041
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,390
stations they would land down here
otherwise they would go to

5042
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:18,400
otherwise they would go to
 

5043
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,990
otherwise they would go to
a killing spot here for the regular

5044
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
a killing spot here for the regular
 

5045
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,070
a killing spot here for the regular
zombies okay i think i gotta figure it

5046
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:22,080
zombies okay i think i gotta figure it
 

5047
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,030
zombies okay i think i gotta figure it
out so

5048
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
out so
 

5049
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,629
out so
it only works if there's a zombie

5050
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
it only works if there's a zombie
 

5051
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,189
it only works if there's a zombie
villager in here it turns on some lights

5052
01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:27,199
villager in here it turns on some lights
 

5053
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,350
villager in here it turns on some lights
and the tripwire gets activated

5054
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
and the tripwire gets activated
 

5055
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,030
and the tripwire gets activated
and then when we hit the medicine button

5056
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
and then when we hit the medicine button
 

5057
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,750
and then when we hit the medicine button
oh that was really flu only the ones

5058
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
oh that was really flu only the ones
 

5059

oh that was really flu only the ones
that have the zombies in will have the

5060
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
that have the zombies in will have the
 

5061
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,030
that have the zombies in will have the
weakness potions dispensed

5062
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
weakness potions dispensed
 

5063
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,669
weakness potions dispensed
otherwise it doesn't waste them and i

5064
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:41,679
otherwise it doesn't waste them and i
 

5065
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,189
otherwise it doesn't waste them and i
think there's also

5066
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
think there's also
 

5067
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,550
think there's also
oh yeah and then when they would get

5068
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
oh yeah and then when they would get
 

5069
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,070
oh yeah and then when they would get
cured that would get them out of the

5070
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,080
cured that would get them out of the
 

5071
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,830
cured that would get them out of the
station with this button

5072
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
station with this button
 

5073
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,510
station with this button
and then there's a furnace minecart to

5074
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,520
and then there's a furnace minecart to
 

5075
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,310
and then there's a furnace minecart to
get them through the portal

5076
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:54,320

i think we finally covered everything in
 

5151
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,070
i think we finally covered everything in
the main area we can start heading to

5152
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:12,080
the main area we can start heading to
 

5153
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,950
the main area we can start heading to
the nether

we skipped over the crimson wood and
 

5157
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,030
we skipped over the crimson wood and
worked wood farm here we just built this

5158
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,040
worked wood farm here we just built this
 

5159

recently

5160
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
recently
 

5161

so let's head back to sandy city
 

5165
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,189
so let's head back to sandy city
there's a secret nether portal down here

5166
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:25,199
there's a secret nether portal down here
 

5167
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,510
there's a secret nether portal down here
land on the pressure plate it pushes us

5168
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
land on the pressure plate it pushes us
 

5169
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,790
land on the pressure plate it pushes us
into the portal

01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
into the portal
 

5171
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,430
into the portal
then it closes behind us and we're

5172
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,440
then it closes behind us and we're
 

5173
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:31,990
then it closes behind us and we're
finally

finally
 

5175
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,990
finally
into the nether our nether hub is right

5176
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,000
into the nether our nether hub is right
 

5177
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,189
into the nether our nether hub is right
over here

5178
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
over here

01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,040
builds this one
 

5189
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,430
builds this one
is mostly just for farming we got a sand

5190
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:47,440
is mostly just for farming we got a sand
 

5191
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,310

farm
 

5193
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,390
farm
and ice farm down this way nothing else

5194
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:50,400
and ice farm down this way nothing else
 

5195
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,750
and ice farm down this way nothing else
really so we

5196
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:51,760
really so we
 

5197
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,709
really so we
probably won't end up going there uh-huh

5198
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:54,719
probably won't end up going there uh-huh
 

5199
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,310
probably won't end up going there uh-huh
so something we just did recently

5200
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
so something we just did recently
 

5201
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,229
so something we just did recently
actually is we mapped out our nether and

5202
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
actually is we mapped out our nether and
 

5203
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,149
actually is we mapped out our nether and
marked a lot of the key locations with

5204
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:00,159
marked a lot of the key locations with
 

5205
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,030
marked a lot of the key locations with
banners

5206
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
banners
 

5207
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,149
banners
we're gonna be checking out some of

5208
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
we're gonna be checking out some of
 

5209
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,470
we're gonna be checking out some of
these in just a second you'll notice a

5210
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,480
these in just a second you'll notice a
 

5211
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,149
these in just a second you'll notice a
lot of our nether portals have

5212
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
lot of our nether portals have
 

5213
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,750
lot of our nether portals have
buttons on these are for lighting and

5214
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:09,760
buttons on these are for lighting and
 

5215
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,990
buttons on these are for lighting and
shutting off portals and some of them

5216
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
shutting off portals and some of them
 

5217
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,470
shutting off portals and some of them
will light it and then shut it off

5218
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
will light it and then shut it off
 

5219
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,830
will light it and then shut it off
after we go through um this is part of

5220
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
after we go through um this is part of
 

5221
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:18,070
after we go through um this is part of
the

5222
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,080
the
 

5223
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,990
the
portal network which doesn't work

5224
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:20,000
portal network which doesn't work
 

5225
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,070
portal network which doesn't work
anymore but we used to have codes

5226
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
anymore but we used to have codes
 

5227
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,550
anymore but we used to have codes
to go into different locations uh we

5228
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560
to go into different locations uh we
 

5229
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,310
to go into different locations uh we
would set the code by the delay on the

5230
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
would set the code by the delay on the
 

5231
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,110
would set the code by the delay on the
repeaters

5232
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
repeaters
 

5233
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,110
repeaters
and then it would break all the portals

5234
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,120
and then it would break all the portals
 

5235
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,110
and then it would break all the portals
that aren't that code and then it would

5236
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:33,120
that aren't that code and then it would
 

5237
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,870
that aren't that code and then it would
light the only one that was

5238
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
light the only one that was
 

5239
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,070
light the only one that was
i'm trying to think of the best way to

5240
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
i'm trying to think of the best way to
 

5241
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,310
i'm trying to think of the best way to
explain this but basically if a portal

5242
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320
explain this but basically if a portal
 

5243
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,110
explain this but basically if a portal
wasn't

5244
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,120
wasn't
 

5245
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,110
wasn't
available if it wasn't lit it would

5246
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,120
available if it wasn't lit it would
 

5247
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,350
available if it wasn't lit it would
search up to 128 blocks

5248
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:43,360
search up to 128 blocks
 

5249
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,750
search up to 128 blocks
in the nether for another one that was

5250
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
in the nether for another one that was
 

5251
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,510
in the nether for another one that was
so you could control which one you

5252
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
so you could control which one you
 

5253
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,270
so you could control which one you
wanted to go to that way

5254
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:49,280
wanted to go to that way
 

5255
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,149
wanted to go to that way
and basically get a free thousand block

5256
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:52,159
and basically get a free thousand block
 

5257
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,910
and basically get a free thousand block
uh teleport from the overworld to the

5258
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
uh teleport from the overworld to the
 

5259
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,910
uh teleport from the overworld to the
nether and then you go through

5260
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
nether and then you go through
 

5261
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,750
nether and then you go through
the different nether portal you ended up

5262
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:57,760
the different nether portal you ended up
 

5263
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,990
the different nether portal you ended up
at and it was all linked together with

5264
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
at and it was all linked together with
 

5265
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,910
at and it was all linked together with
two-way repeaters and there was a

5266
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
two-way repeaters and there was a
 

5267
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,070
two-way repeaters and there was a
decoding system to figure out which

5268
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:04,080
decoding system to figure out which
 

5269
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,510
decoding system to figure out which
portal he would go to based on the

5270
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
portal he would go to based on the
 

5271
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,950
portal he would go to based on the
repeater strength

5272
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
repeater strength
 

5273
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,310
repeater strength
and uh yeah anyways let's uh check out

5274
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
and uh yeah anyways let's uh check out
 

5275
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,590
and uh yeah anyways let's uh check out
some other stuff that's a little easier

5276
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:11,600
some other stuff that's a little easier
 

5277
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,110
some other stuff that's a little easier
to understand we got a light show that

5278
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,120
to understand we got a light show that
 

5279
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,629
to understand we got a light show that
goes around here

5280
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:14,639
goes around here
 

5281
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,189
goes around here
we also got the decotonizer 9000 at the

5282
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
we also got the decotonizer 9000 at the
 

5283
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,390
we also got the decotonizer 9000 at the
hub here so

5284
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:18,400
hub here so
 

5285
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,910
hub here so
i was very stubborn about building an

5286
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:19,920
i was very stubborn about building an
 

5287
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,830
i was very stubborn about building an
iron farm and i was wasting a lot of

5288
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
iron farm and i was wasting a lot of
 

5289
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,990
iron farm and i was wasting a lot of
iron on buckets so

5290
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
iron on buckets so
 

5291
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,350
iron on buckets so
we made a way to buy them

5292
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,360
we made a way to buy them
 

5293
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,709
we made a way to buy them
it would empty the car out of the

5294
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:28,719
it would empty the car out of the
 

5295
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:31,110
it would empty the car out of the
buckets and then they end up in here

5296
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:31,120
buckets and then they end up in here
 

5297
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,110
buckets and then they end up in here
no over here yeah and we also have a

5298
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,120
no over here yeah and we also have a
 

5299
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,870
no over here yeah and we also have a
horse swapping station we could choose

5300
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:34,880
horse swapping station we could choose
 

5301
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,110
horse swapping station we could choose
between a mule or a fast horse for going

5302
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
between a mule or a fast horse for going
 

5303
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,470
between a mule or a fast horse for going
down our nether tunnels

5304
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
down our nether tunnels
 

5305
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,229
down our nether tunnels
if we wanted to transport stuff we would

5306
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
if we wanted to transport stuff we would
 

5307
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,229
if we wanted to transport stuff we would
pick the mule but uh

5308
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
pick the mule but uh
 

5309
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,910
pick the mule but uh
the game has changed quite a bit since

5310
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
the game has changed quite a bit since
 

5311
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,709
the game has changed quite a bit since
then we got shocker boxes and

5312
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:46,719
then we got shocker boxes and
 

5313
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,189
then we got shocker boxes and
ice roads and all kinds of better ways

5314
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:49,199
ice roads and all kinds of better ways
 

5315
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,310
ice roads and all kinds of better ways
of getting around now

5316
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
of getting around now
 

5317
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,709
of getting around now
and moving things uh we got blue ice

5318
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:52,719
and moving things uh we got blue ice
 

5319
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,310
and moving things uh we got blue ice
running down the center of our roads

5320
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
running down the center of our roads
 

5321
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,990
running down the center of our roads
here so we can get around very

5322
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
here so we can get around very
 

5323
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,149
here so we can get around very
quickly now and i'm thinking we'll want

5324
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
quickly now and i'm thinking we'll want
 

5325
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,270
quickly now and i'm thinking we'll want
to skip a lot of the

5326
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
to skip a lot of the
 

5327
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,270
to skip a lot of the
transport time down the nether just to

5328
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,280
transport time down the nether just to
 

5329
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,430
transport time down the nether just to
save episode time

5330
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
save episode time
 

5331
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,229
save episode time
because it's getting super long but we

5332
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
because it's getting super long but we
 

5333
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,990
because it's getting super long but we
got about 10 000 blocks of nether

5334
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,000
got about 10 000 blocks of nether
 

5335
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,750
got about 10 000 blocks of nether
tunnels i think at this point is pretty

5336
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:09,760
tunnels i think at this point is pretty
 

5337
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,950
tunnels i think at this point is pretty
insane

5338
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
insane
 

5339
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,270
insane
uh this is slab city guys this was

5340
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:13,280
uh this is slab city guys this was
 

5341
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,430
uh this is slab city guys this was
another attempt at making a new base

5342
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:15,440
another attempt at making a new base
 

5343
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,430
another attempt at making a new base
the restriction for this one is we had

5344
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
the restriction for this one is we had
 

5345
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,030
the restriction for this one is we had
to build using

5346
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,040
to build using
 

5347
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,229
to build using
nine by four chunks of building

5348
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:22,239
nine by four chunks of building
 

5349
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,430
nine by four chunks of building
materials

5350
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
materials
 

5351
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,629
materials
and it was a cool thought but

5352
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
and it was a cool thought but
 

5353
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:27,990
and it was a cool thought but
at the same time it also made it

5354
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:28,000
at the same time it also made it
 

5355
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,070
at the same time it also made it
extremely difficult to decorate

5356
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
extremely difficult to decorate
 

5357
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,830
extremely difficult to decorate
so i struggled a lot with this and i

5358
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
so i struggled a lot with this and i
 

5359
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,030
so i struggled a lot with this and i
don't know if we're going to continue it

5360
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040
don't know if we're going to continue it
 

5361
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,629
don't know if we're going to continue it
or not

5362
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:34,639
or not
 

5363
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,550
or not
i'll see what you guys say about it but

5364
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,560
i'll see what you guys say about it but
 

5365
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,990
i'll see what you guys say about it but
i found it really hard to make it look

5366
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,000
i found it really hard to make it look
 

5367
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,110
i found it really hard to make it look
good because um by nature we have to

5368
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:41,120
good because um by nature we have to
 

5369
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,310
good because um by nature we have to
keep the walls flat

5370
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:42,320
keep the walls flat
 

5371
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,070
keep the walls flat
and if you want to make things look good

5372
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
and if you want to make things look good
 

5373
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,990
and if you want to make things look good
in minecraft it can't be flat

5374
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
in minecraft it can't be flat
 

5375
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,669
in minecraft it can't be flat
because then you don't get the shadows

5376
01:29:47,669 --> 01:29:47,679
because then you don't get the shadows
 

5377
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,510
because then you don't get the shadows
and stuff unless you're using

5378
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,520
and stuff unless you're using
 

5379
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,910
and stuff unless you're using
shaders it's a different story we had a

5380
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
shaders it's a different story we had a
 

5381
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,750
shaders it's a different story we had a
concrete maker over here just a simple

5382
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
concrete maker over here just a simple
 

5383
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,070
concrete maker over here just a simple
one where we could uh turn the dust

5384
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
one where we could uh turn the dust
 

5385
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,270
one where we could uh turn the dust
into uh solid concrete we had a minecart

5386
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
into uh solid concrete we had a minecart
 

5387
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,110
into uh solid concrete we had a minecart
storage system here as well so let's say

5388
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
storage system here as well so let's say
 

5389
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,709
storage system here as well so let's say
we were looking for a block like pink

5390
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
we were looking for a block like pink
 

5391
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,390
we were looking for a block like pink
concrete i don't know if that'll show up

5392
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,400
concrete i don't know if that'll show up
 

5393
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,990
concrete i don't know if that'll show up
oh yeah there's some in there we also

5394
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
oh yeah there's some in there we also
 

5395
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,750
oh yeah there's some in there we also
had a tree farm system

5396
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:07,760
had a tree farm system
 

5397
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,030
had a tree farm system
so we would get our saplings

5398
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
so we would get our saplings
 

5399
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,669
so we would get our saplings
is it automated oh it tried tried to

5400
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
is it automated oh it tried tried to
 

5401
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,709
is it automated oh it tried tried to
grow it

5402
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:14,719
grow it
 

5403
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,990
grow it
what about this one moving on the next

5404
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
what about this one moving on the next
 

5405
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,790
what about this one moving on the next
stop in our

5406
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
stop in our
 

5407
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,430
stop in our
nether journey is the amplified base

5408
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
nether journey is the amplified base
 

5409
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,310
nether journey is the amplified base
guys

5410
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
guys
 

5411
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,390
guys
so at one point in the series when

5412
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
so at one point in the series when
 

5413
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,229
so at one point in the series when
amplified terrain became a possibility

5414
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
amplified terrain became a possibility
 

5415
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,550
amplified terrain became a possibility
we did update our world that was one

5416
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
we did update our world that was one
 

5417
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,709
we did update our world that was one
like uh outside of the game adjustment

5418
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
like uh outside of the game adjustment
 

5419
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,070
like uh outside of the game adjustment
we made to our world

5420
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,080
we made to our world
 

5421
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,990
we made to our world
so now we get amplified terrain when we

5422
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:34,000
so now we get amplified terrain when we
 

5423
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,430
so now we get amplified terrain when we
explore further out

5424
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440
explore further out
 

5425
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,950
explore further out
and we tried to make this place

5426
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:38,960
and we tried to make this place
 

5427
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,990
and we tried to make this place
work a bit but uh

5428
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
work a bit but uh
 

5429
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,030
work a bit but uh
it became just a big mess basically um

5430
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
it became just a big mess basically um
 

5431
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,790
it became just a big mess basically um
there's a clock over here that would

5432
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:46,800
there's a clock over here that would
 

5433
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,310
there's a clock over here that would
sync itself to

5434
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
sync itself to
 

5435
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,470
sync itself to
the proper time i don't think we ever

5436
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
the proper time i don't think we ever
 

5437
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,510
the proper time i don't think we ever
finished that

5438
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,520
finished that
 

5439
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,470
finished that
um let's see the idea was to use like a

5440
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
um let's see the idea was to use like a
 

5441
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,070
um let's see the idea was to use like a
bunch of slime launchers to get around

5442
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
bunch of slime launchers to get around
 

5443
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,830
bunch of slime launchers to get around
this place and then slime blocks kind of

5444
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:57,840
this place and then slime blocks kind of
 

5445
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,229
this place and then slime blocks kind of
broke for a few years well we had a

5446
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239
broke for a few years well we had a
 

5447
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:00,950
broke for a few years well we had a
bunch of slime

5448
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
bunch of slime
 

5449
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,030
bunch of slime
launchers for getting up the mountains

5450
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
launchers for getting up the mountains
 

5451
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,669
launchers for getting up the mountains
and stuff these work now though which is

5452
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
and stuff these work now though which is
 

5453
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,669
and stuff these work now though which is
kind of cool they were broken for a long

5454
01:31:07,669 --> 01:31:07,679
kind of cool they were broken for a long
 

5455
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,229
kind of cool they were broken for a long
time um

5456
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
time um
 

5457
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:13,750
time um
let's see here we had oh i forgot about

5458
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:13,760
let's see here we had oh i forgot about
 

5459
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,950
let's see here we had oh i forgot about
that that's like a tree farm

5460
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960
that that's like a tree farm
 

5461
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,790
that that's like a tree farm
this is a cool thing though we had a way

5462
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
this is a cool thing though we had a way
 

5463
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,070
this is a cool thing though we had a way
of moving

5464
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
of moving
 

5465
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,830
of moving
a bunch of mine carts like a storage

5466
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:19,840
a bunch of mine carts like a storage
 

5467
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,790
a bunch of mine carts like a storage
system made out of storage mine carts

5468
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
system made out of storage mine carts
 

5469
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,270
system made out of storage mine carts
we hit the button and it would

5470
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,280
we hit the button and it would
 

5471
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,669
we hit the button and it would
automatically move to the next station

5472
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:27,679
automatically move to the next station
 

5473
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,870
automatically move to the next station
in our amplified base area

5474
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:30,880
in our amplified base area
 

5475
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,510
in our amplified base area
i think the next one on the list is over

5476
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:33,520
i think the next one on the list is over
 

5477
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,830
i think the next one on the list is over
here

5478
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:35,840
here
 

5479
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,590
here
they should end up over here if it still

5480
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:37,600
they should end up over here if it still
 

5481
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,590
they should end up over here if it still
works yep here they come and

5482
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:39,600
works yep here they come and
 

5483
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,629
works yep here they come and
everything goes in the exact same order

5484
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:42,639
everything goes in the exact same order
 

5485
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:43,910
everything goes in the exact same order
which is pretty cool and then there's

5486
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:43,920
which is pretty cool and then there's
 

5487
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,510
which is pretty cool and then there's
one more station after this and then

5488
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,520
one more station after this and then
 

5489
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,709
one more station after this and then
they end up back at the first one there

5490
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
they end up back at the first one there
 

5491
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,550
they end up back at the first one there
we had some kind of weird chicken farm

5492
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,560
we had some kind of weird chicken farm
 

5493
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,229
we had some kind of weird chicken farm
here too they would like get

5494
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
here too they would like get
 

5495
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:55,430
here too they would like get
shot out and fall down a big hole here

5496
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,440
shot out and fall down a big hole here
 

5497
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,189
shot out and fall down a big hole here
and this area is a flower forest so at

5498
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:57,199
and this area is a flower forest so at
 

5499
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:58,870
and this area is a flower forest so at
the very top of the hill we actually had

5500
01:31:58,870 --> 01:31:58,880
the very top of the hill we actually had
 

5501
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,470
the very top of the hill we actually had
a flower farm

5502
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:00,480
a flower farm
 

5503
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:05,110
a flower farm
which uh i don't think works very well

5504
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120

 

5505
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,550

it's okay it's okay it's just uh

5506
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
it's okay it's okay it's just uh
 

5507
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,629
it's okay it's okay it's just uh
not the best we'd have to manually plant

5508
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
not the best we'd have to manually plant
 

5509
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,950
not the best we'd have to manually plant
them next stop down our nether tunnel is

5510
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
them next stop down our nether tunnel is
 

5511
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,110
them next stop down our nether tunnel is
the mesa mining zone

5512
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,120
the mesa mining zone
 

5513
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,990
the mesa mining zone
we had a way of uh sending out storage

5514
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
we had a way of uh sending out storage
 

5515
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,669
we had a way of uh sending out storage
mine carts to where we would do our

5516
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
mine carts to where we would do our
 

5517
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:20,709
mine carts to where we would do our
mining

5518
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:20,719
mining
 

5519
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,310
mining
we would send as many as we wanted and

5520
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:22,320
we would send as many as we wanted and
 

5521
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,070
we would send as many as we wanted and
then we would hop on ourselves

5522
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,080
then we would hop on ourselves
 

5523
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,590
then we would hop on ourselves
and go there uh most of this is uh

5524
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:27,600
and go there uh most of this is uh
 

5525
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,430
and go there uh most of this is uh
kind of mined out we use shocker boxes

5526
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:29,440
kind of mined out we use shocker boxes
 

5527
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,990
kind of mined out we use shocker boxes
nowadays for moving stuff so that's all

5528
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
nowadays for moving stuff so that's all
 

5529
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,070
nowadays for moving stuff so that's all
kind of pointless

5530
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
kind of pointless
 

5531
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,590
kind of pointless
but when we would return the storage

5532
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:35,600
but when we would return the storage
 

5533
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,510
but when we would return the storage
minecarts full of the clay it would go

5534
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:37,520
minecarts full of the clay it would go
 

5535
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,229
minecarts full of the clay it would go
up into

5536
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
up into
 

5537
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,310
up into
a sorting system and it would all

5538
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
a sorting system and it would all
 

5539
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,310
a sorting system and it would all
organize according to its color

5540
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,320
organize according to its color
 

5541
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,790
organize according to its color
in the chess so white would go in here

5542
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
in the chess so white would go in here
 

5543
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,470
in the chess so white would go in here
and light gray in here that sort of

5544
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
and light gray in here that sort of
 

5545
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,350
and light gray in here that sort of
thing

5546
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:47,360
thing
 

5547
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,229
thing
uh also in this area is drearyville up

5548
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
uh also in this area is drearyville up
 

5549
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,030
uh also in this area is drearyville up
these stairs

5550
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
these stairs
 

5551
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,510
these stairs
let's head over there and do the special

5552
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
let's head over there and do the special
 

5553
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,030
let's head over there and do the special
and you know i think we're gonna change

5554
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040
and you know i think we're gonna change
 

5555
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,310
and you know i think we're gonna change
it up this time just for a bit of

5556
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:56,320
it up this time just for a bit of
 

5557
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,149
it up this time just for a bit of
variety because we've seen this uh

5558
01:32:58,149 --> 01:32:58,159
variety because we've seen this uh
 

5559
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,229
variety because we've seen this uh
show several times at this point we've

5560
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
show several times at this point we've
 

5561
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,550
show several times at this point we've
never seen it with shaders on before

here and then we get to the edge and
 

5637
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,910
here and then we get to the edge and
then the piston thing launches us

5638

then the piston thing launches us
 

5639
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,189
then the piston thing launches us
forward and then we

5640
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:43,199
forward and then we
 

5641
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,030
forward and then we
press left on our keyboard and we start

5648
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
and then they go up a bubble elevator
 

5649
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,669
and then they go up a bubble elevator
and into the storage over here and don't

we've been working on since the nether

5656
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,520
we've been working on since the nether
 

5657
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,950
we've been working on since the nether
update came out

5658
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:00,960
update came out
 

5659
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,229
update came out
uh the general idea is to take a bastion

5660
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
uh the general idea is to take a bastion
 

5661
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:08,470
uh the general idea is to take a bastion
and turn it into a fancy bastion

5662
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:08,480

 

5663
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,950

so we've uh got some basics down here

5664
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
so we've uh got some basics down here
 

5665
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,390
so we've uh got some basics down here
we're switching out the ground with

5666

we're switching out the ground with
 

5667
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,430
we're switching out the ground with
nylium

5668
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440

railing
 

5673
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,950
railing
and the big thing we got built at the

5674
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
and the big thing we got built at the
 

5675
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,109
and the big thing we got built at the
moment is a

5676
01:35:21,109 --> 01:35:21,119
moment is a
 

5677
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,030
moment is a
piglen bartering system so we put the

5678
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
piglen bartering system so we put the
 

5679
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,109
piglen bartering system so we put the
golden up here

5680
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:25,119
golden up here
 

5681
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,350
golden up here
and then it gets delivered to 12

5682
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
and then it gets delivered to 12
 

5683
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,470
and then it gets delivered to 12
different uh

5684
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
different uh
 

5685
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,109
different uh
piglens and then uh runs through a bunch

5686
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:31,119
piglens and then uh runs through a bunch
 

5687
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:33,189
piglens and then uh runs through a bunch
of item filters at four times

5688
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
of item filters at four times
 

5689
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:36,149
of item filters at four times
hopper speed and we can get a lot of

5690
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:36,159
hopper speed and we can get a lot of
 

5691
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,629
hopper speed and we can get a lot of
items very quickly if we got the gold

5692
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
items very quickly if we got the gold
 

5693
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,550
items very quickly if we got the gold
which we generally don't have yet but

5694
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
which we generally don't have yet but
 

5695
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,830
which we generally don't have yet but
yeah all the items we get from the

5696
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:41,840
yeah all the items we get from the
 

5697
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,830
yeah all the items we get from the
piglens get automatically sorted into

5698
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
piglens get automatically sorted into
 

5699
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,270
piglens get automatically sorted into
the chests according to where they

5700
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,280
the chests according to where they
 

5701
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,070
the chests according to where they
belong

5702
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
belong
 

5703
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,149
belong
which is pretty nice cool so that's

5704
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
which is pretty nice cool so that's
 

5705
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,270
which is pretty nice cool so that's
another branch done

5706
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
another branch done
 

5707
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,189
another branch done
in our nether hub now we're back here i

5708
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
in our nether hub now we're back here i
 

5709
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,790
in our nether hub now we're back here i
want to go in spectator mode and just

5710
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
want to go in spectator mode and just
 

5711
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,470
want to go in spectator mode and just
show you what we got going on in the

5712
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,480
show you what we got going on in the
 

5713
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,430
show you what we got going on in the
area

5714
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
area
 

5715
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,830
area
so up above our nether hub is a gold

5716
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
so up above our nether hub is a gold
 

5717
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,709
so up above our nether hub is a gold
farm

5718
01:35:58,709 --> 01:35:58,719
farm
 

5719
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,629
farm
that kind of got abandoned this was our

5720
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:00,639
that kind of got abandoned this was our
 

5721
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,070
that kind of got abandoned this was our
first attempt at it

5722
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,080
first attempt at it
 

5723
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,470
first attempt at it
and then we rebuilt another one above

5724
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
and then we rebuilt another one above
 

5725
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,510
and then we rebuilt another one above
that

5726
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,520
that
 

5727
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,109
that

there's some trip wires
 

5739
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,870
there's some trip wires
um there's a lot of spawning space here

5740
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:20,880
um there's a lot of spawning space here
 

5741
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,990
um there's a lot of spawning space here
actually

5742
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:22,000
actually
 

5743
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,750

nether portals all over the place
 

5747
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,669
nether portals all over the place
and then over at this end we have some

5748
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
and then over at this end we have some
 

5749
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,350
and then over at this end we have some
buttons for controlling that

that one's for lighting it usually we
 

5753
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,030
that one's for lighting it usually we
keep these off because otherwise it

5754
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,040
keep these off because otherwise it
 

5755
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,229
keep these off because otherwise it
causes a lot of lag

5756
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
causes a lot of lag
 

5757
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,229

furnace and then it would
extract the water all right and then

5970
01:40:22,629 --> 01:40:22,639
extract the water all right and then
 

5971

then there's a minecraft that runs
 

6075
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:19,990
then there's a minecraft that runs

first off is the witch farm
 

6103
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,510
first off is the witch farm
it's uh definitely in need of more work

6104
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
it's uh definitely in need of more work
 

6105
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,350
it's uh definitely in need of more work
still it's not very decorated

6106
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:53,360
still it's not very decorated
 

6107
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,590
still it's not very decorated
but the witches spawn up above they fall

6108
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
but the witches spawn up above they fall

um i've actually had a big problem in my

6116
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:03,440
um i've actually had a big problem in my
 

6117
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,590
um i've actually had a big problem in my
world with finding witch farms

6118
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:05,600
world with finding witch farms
 

6119
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,189
world with finding witch farms
let's see we got the area pretty lit up

6120
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
let's see we got the area pretty lit up
 

6121
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,709
let's see we got the area pretty lit up
which is good

6122
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
which is good
 

6123
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,590
which is good
because we started the world so early it

6124
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,600
because we started the world so early it
 

6125
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,750
because we started the world so early it
was before which farms were a thing

6126
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:13,760
was before which farms were a thing
 

6127
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,990
was before which farms were a thing
and then we switched to amplified so

6128
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,000
and then we switched to amplified so
 

6129
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,149
and then we switched to amplified so
it's like impossible to

6130
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:18,159
it's like impossible to
 

6131
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,870
it's like impossible to
find a flat area to actually build one

6132
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:20,880
find a flat area to actually build one
 

6133
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,950
find a flat area to actually build one
without having to remove giant mountains

6134
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:22,960
without having to remove giant mountains
 

6135
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,990
without having to remove giant mountains
and stuff or light them

6136
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
and stuff or light them
 

6137
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,629
and stuff or light them
up but yeah they spawn over here and

6138
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
up but yeah they spawn over here and
 

6139
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,470
up but yeah they spawn over here and
then the shifting floors drop them down

6140
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
then the shifting floors drop them down
 

6141
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,910
then the shifting floors drop them down
below

6142
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:29,920
below
 

6143
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,910
below
uh this is good for the most part but a

6144
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
uh this is good for the most part but a
 

6145
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,270
uh this is good for the most part but a
little bit of the mountains are within

6146
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:33,280
little bit of the mountains are within
 

6147
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,149
little bit of the mountains are within
range of

6148
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
range of
 

6149
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,709
range of
where we stand so it's not the most

6150
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
where we stand so it's not the most
 

6151
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,270
where we stand so it's not the most
efficient farm and it's only a single

6152
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:39,280
efficient farm and it's only a single
 

6153
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,750
efficient farm and it's only a single
farm and i find there's much better ways

6154
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
farm and i find there's much better ways
 

6155
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,189
farm and i find there's much better ways
of getting redstone actually

6156
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
of getting redstone actually
 

6157
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,350
of getting redstone actually
so i don't use it too often at the very

6158
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
so i don't use it too often at the very
 

6159
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,590
so i don't use it too often at the very
end of this very long nether tunnel we

6160
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:47,600
end of this very long nether tunnel we
 

6161
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,229
end of this very long nether tunnel we
have the

6162
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:48,239
have the
 

6163
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,430
have the
underwater base guys yet again another

6164
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
underwater base guys yet again another
 

6165
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:51,990
underwater base guys yet again another
one of our

6166
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
one of our
 

6167
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,870
one of our
unfinished bases this is the one i'm

6168
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
unfinished bases this is the one i'm
 

6169
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,950
unfinished bases this is the one i'm
most likely to return to though

6170
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:56,960
most likely to return to though
 

6171
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,189
most likely to return to though
i think it has the most potential we did

6172
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
i think it has the most potential we did
 

6173
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,270
i think it has the most potential we did
a couple wacky builds here we have an

6174
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
a couple wacky builds here we have an
 

6175
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,990
a couple wacky builds here we have an
underwater

6176

underwater
 

6177
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,470
underwater
tree farm it definitely takes a bit of

6178
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:04,480
tree farm it definitely takes a bit of
 

6179
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,030
tree farm it definitely takes a bit of
time

6180
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
time
 

6181
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,830
time
oh there it goes okay so it does grow so

6182
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:07,840
oh there it goes okay so it does grow so
 

6183
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,590
oh there it goes okay so it does grow so
on the retraction of the blocks it

6184
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
on the retraction of the blocks it
 

6185
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,669
on the retraction of the blocks it
leaves a little air pocket for a brief

6186
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
leaves a little air pocket for a brief
 

6187
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,669
leaves a little air pocket for a brief
moment and in that moment we have to try

6188
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:13,679
moment and in that moment we have to try
 

6189
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:15,109
moment and in that moment we have to try
grow the tree

6190
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:15,119
grow the tree
 

6191
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,750
grow the tree
uh if we step here it removes the oak

6192
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
uh if we step here it removes the oak
 

6193
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,109
uh if we step here it removes the oak
block in the way

6194
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:19,119
block in the way
 

6195
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:20,629
block in the way
and then there's a dispenser here for

6196
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:20,639
and then there's a dispenser here for
 

6197
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,470
and then there's a dispenser here for
more saplings

6198
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:22,480
more saplings
 

6199
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,550
more saplings
and i guess it grows leaves under water

6200
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
and i guess it grows leaves under water
 

6201
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,709
and i guess it grows leaves under water
now that's a new thing

6202
01:44:26,709 --> 01:44:26,719
now that's a new thing
 

6203
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,510
now that's a new thing
it used to just leave the wood we got a

6204
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,520
it used to just leave the wood we got a
 

6205
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,189
it used to just leave the wood we got a
sea pickle farm over here i don't think

6206
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:31,199
sea pickle farm over here i don't think
 

6207
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,390
sea pickle farm over here i don't think
i want to demonstrate that though i

6208
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
i want to demonstrate that though i
 

6209
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,510
i want to demonstrate that though i
don't think it works too well

6210
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:33,520
don't think it works too well
 

6211
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,229
don't think it works too well
we have an underwater enchanting station

6212
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
we have an underwater enchanting station
 

6213
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,390
we have an underwater enchanting station
same kind of gimmick we have to

6214
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,400
same kind of gimmick we have to
 

6215
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,470
same kind of gimmick we have to
activate the enchanting at the exact

the bookshelves retract

6220
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:45,760
the bookshelves retract
 

6221
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,109
the bookshelves retract
oh there we go yeah we right click the

6222
01:44:47,109 --> 01:44:47,119
oh there we go yeah we right click the
 

6223
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,270
oh there we go yeah we right click the
note block they extend and then they

6224
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
note block they extend and then they
 

6225
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,149
note block they extend and then they
retract

6226
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
retract
 

6227
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,550
retract
leave some air pockets behind so we can

6228
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:52,560
leave some air pockets behind so we can
 

6229
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,470
leave some air pockets behind so we can
get to level 30 that way

6230
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:54,480
get to level 30 that way
 

6231
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,390
get to level 30 that way
otherwise the water blocks them we also

6232
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,400
otherwise the water blocks them we also
 

6233
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,390
otherwise the water blocks them we also
got a hostile mob system in this area

6234
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:58,400
got a hostile mob system in this area
 

6235
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,550
got a hostile mob system in this area
that's mostly to stop drown mobs from

6236
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:00,560
that's mostly to stop drown mobs from
 

6237
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,629
that's mostly to stop drown mobs from
spawning and attacking us if

6238
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
spawning and attacking us if
 

6239
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:05,270
spawning and attacking us if
we got the regular guys spawning it cuts

6240
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
we got the regular guys spawning it cuts
 

6241
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,149
we got the regular guys spawning it cuts
down on the mob

6242
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:06,159
down on the mob
 

6243
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:09,270
down on the mob
cap they spawn on the platforms and then

6244
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,280
cap they spawn on the platforms and then
 

6245
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:09,910
cap they spawn on the platforms and then
they move

6246
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:09,920
they move
 

6247
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,109
they move
into a water elevator here

6248
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
into a water elevator here
 

6249
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,750
into a water elevator here
which is a pretty good design actually

6250
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:15,760
which is a pretty good design actually
 

6251
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,149
which is a pretty good design actually
they

6252
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:16,159
they
 

6253
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:18,709
they
get flown up a bubble elevator to the

6254
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:18,719
get flown up a bubble elevator to the
 

6255
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,790
get flown up a bubble elevator to the
top they fall down

6256
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
top they fall down
 

6257
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,390
top they fall down
at the end here and land over here

6258
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
at the end here and land over here
 

6259
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,430
at the end here and land over here
and there's also a way of switching it

6260
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
and there's also a way of switching it
 

6261
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,109
and there's also a way of switching it
i think that makes some pistons extend

6262
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
i think that makes some pistons extend
 

6263
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,550
i think that makes some pistons extend
and then they end up over here and we

6264
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:30,560
and then they end up over here and we
 

6265
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,109
and then they end up over here and we
can manually kill them if we want to

6266
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:33,119
can manually kill them if we want to
 

6267
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,030
can manually kill them if we want to
i guess there's a light system for the

6268
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,040
i guess there's a light system for the
 

6269
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,310
i guess there's a light system for the
farm i don't know what that's about i

6270
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
farm i don't know what that's about i
 

6271
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,669
farm i don't know what that's about i
think there is actually

6272
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
think there is actually
 

6273
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,590
think there is actually
oh yeah check it out we got lamps above

6274
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:39,600
oh yeah check it out we got lamps above
 

6275
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,870
oh yeah check it out we got lamps above
the spawning pads so

6276
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:40,880
the spawning pads so
 

6277
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,390
the spawning pads so
when those are on it's too bright for

6278
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:42,400
when those are on it's too bright for
 

6279
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,229
when those are on it's too bright for
them to spawn on the platforms and then

6280
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
them to spawn on the platforms and then
 

6281
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,910
them to spawn on the platforms and then
we'll start getting a bunch of

6282
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:45,920
we'll start getting a bunch of
 

6283
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,590
we'll start getting a bunch of
drowned guys spawning in the water

6284
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:47,600
drowned guys spawning in the water
 

6285
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,709
drowned guys spawning in the water
around us and the final build to check

6286
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,719
around us and the final build to check
 

6287
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,070
around us and the final build to check
out through our nether hub

6288
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,080
out through our nether hub
 

6289
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,950
out through our nether hub
is the pillager outpost so this was one

6290
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:54,960
is the pillager outpost so this was one
 

6291
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,629
is the pillager outpost so this was one
of those pillager structures we

6292
01:45:56,629 --> 01:45:56,639
of those pillager structures we
 

6293
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:57,430
of those pillager structures we
bulldozed

6294
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,440
bulldozed
 

6295
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,590
bulldozed
and we made a farm out of it just for

6296
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
and we made a farm out of it just for
 

6297
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,990
and we made a farm out of it just for
the the funds of it

6298
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,000
the the funds of it
 

6299
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,229
the the funds of it
i actually had plans on uh making this

6300
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:04,239
i actually had plans on uh making this
 

6301
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:06,070
i actually had plans on uh making this
into a raid farm there used to be a way

6302
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:06,080
into a raid farm there used to be a way
 

6303
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:06,950
into a raid farm there used to be a way
of spawning

6304
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
of spawning
 

6305
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,149
of spawning
multiple raids at the same time and then

6306
01:46:10,149 --> 01:46:10,159
multiple raids at the same time and then
 

6307
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,590
multiple raids at the same time and then
that kind of got patched out of the game

6308
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:11,600
that kind of got patched out of the game
 

6309
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:11,990
that kind of got patched out of the game
so now

6310
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,000
so now
 

6311
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,950
so now
it's kind of just a gimmicky goofy farm

6312
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960
it's kind of just a gimmicky goofy farm
 

6313
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,790
it's kind of just a gimmicky goofy farm
iron golems in the middle to attract the

6314
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:16,800
iron golems in the middle to attract the
 

6315
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,629
iron golems in the middle to attract the
pillagers into these bubble

6316
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:18,639
pillagers into these bubble
 

6317
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,470
pillagers into these bubble
elevators they go up and then

6318
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,480
elevators they go up and then
 

6319
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,950
elevators they go up and then
fall down in the middle here and it

6320
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
fall down in the middle here and it
 

6321
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,629
fall down in the middle here and it
actually works pretty good as a

6322
01:46:26,629 --> 01:46:26,639
actually works pretty good as a
 

6323
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,910
actually works pretty good as a
xp farm and if for some reason what you

6324
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
xp farm and if for some reason what you
 

6325
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,669
xp farm and if for some reason what you
want to

6326
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:31,679
want to
 

6327
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,910
want to
farm crossbows this is a way to do it

6328
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
farm crossbows this is a way to do it
 

6329
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,550
farm crossbows this is a way to do it
too

6330
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560

 

6331
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,270

yeah that goes down into a system here

6332
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,280
yeah that goes down into a system here
 

6333
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,550
yeah that goes down into a system here
for

6334
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
for
 

6335
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,310
for
separating the junk i think we just

6336
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:42,320
separating the junk i think we just
 

6337
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,390
separating the junk i think we just
press q

6338
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
press q
 

6339
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,990
press q
oh and it doesn't land in the lava it

6340
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:46,000
oh and it doesn't land in the lava it
 

6341
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,669
oh and it doesn't land in the lava it
lands on the ledge i forgot about that

6342
01:46:47,669 --> 01:46:47,679
lands on the ledge i forgot about that
 

6343
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,990
lands on the ledge i forgot about that
i was supposed to fix that well this is

6344
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,000
i was supposed to fix that well this is
 

6345
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,669
i was supposed to fix that well this is
it everybody we've seen everything in

6346
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:51,679
it everybody we've seen everything in
 

6347
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:52,390
it everybody we've seen everything in
the main world

6348
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,400
the main world
 

6349
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,910
the main world
and also everything connected through

6350
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
and also everything connected through
 

6351
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,430
and also everything connected through
the nether hub this

6352
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:55,440
the nether hub this
 

6353
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,590
the nether hub this
tunnel goes from the man cave to the

6354
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:57,600
tunnel goes from the man cave to the
 

6355
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,910
tunnel goes from the man cave to the
stronghold base and this is how we get

6356
01:46:59,910 --> 01:46:59,920
stronghold base and this is how we get
 

6357
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,709
stronghold base and this is how we get
to

6358
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:00,719
to
 

6359
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,030
to
the end we save the end for the end

6360
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
the end we save the end for the end
 

6361
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,790
the end we save the end for the end
so there's three main things to check

6362
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:06,800
so there's three main things to check
 

6363
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,149
so there's three main things to check
out here

6364
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
out here
 

6365
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:11,510
out here
first off is the ender ender

6366
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:11,520
first off is the ender ender
 

6367
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,270
first off is the ender ender
1.0 this was the original enderman farm

6368
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,280
1.0 this was the original enderman farm
 

6369
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,790
1.0 this was the original enderman farm
uh if you don't know the history behind

6370
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
uh if you don't know the history behind
 

6371
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,390
uh if you don't know the history behind
this this is pretty key to

6372
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
this this is pretty key to
 

6373
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,990
this this is pretty key to
current endermen farms that exist today

6374
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,000
current endermen farms that exist today
 

6375
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,830
current endermen farms that exist today
i had the idea of building an enderman

6376
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840
i had the idea of building an enderman
 

6377
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,070
i had the idea of building an enderman
farm off away from the main island

6378
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,080
farm off away from the main island
 

6379
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,990
farm off away from the main island
in the past people used to flood those

6380
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:28,000
in the past people used to flood those
 

6381
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,070
in the past people used to flood those
and light them up and

6382
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:30,080
and light them up and
 

6383
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,109
and light them up and
uh it never really worked out too well

6384
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
uh it never really worked out too well
 

6385
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,189
uh it never really worked out too well
so i built one way off from the island

6386
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:35,199
so i built one way off from the island
 

6387
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,270
so i built one way off from the island
and uh i made a spawning

6388
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
and uh i made a spawning
 

6389
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,030
and uh i made a spawning
pad system up above here just the

6390
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:39,040
pad system up above here just the
 

6391
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,270
pad system up above here just the
standard flat

6392
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
standard flat
 

6393
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,629
standard flat
they spawn on the pressure plates and

6394
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:42,639
they spawn on the pressure plates and
 

6395
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,470
they spawn on the pressure plates and
get pushed down sort of thing

6396
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:44,480
get pushed down sort of thing
 

6397
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:47,270
get pushed down sort of thing
get down to a one hit kill we brought a

6398
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
get down to a one hit kill we brought a
 

6399
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,390
get down to a one hit kill we brought a
horse over here we could ride around to

6400
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
horse over here we could ride around to
 

6401
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,149
horse over here we could ride around to
punch him to death and uh

6402
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
punch him to death and uh
 

6403
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,510
punch him to death and uh
it's kind of funny i think it was during

6404
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:55,520
it's kind of funny i think it was during
 

6405
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,350
it's kind of funny i think it was during
one of my episodes i was here like

6406
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:57,360
one of my episodes i was here like
 

6407
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,350
one of my episodes i was here like
looking at the guys and

6408
01:47:59,350 --> 01:47:59,360
looking at the guys and
 

6409
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,750
looking at the guys and
farming them up as like you know i

6410
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:01,760
farming them up as like you know i
 

6411
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,430
farming them up as like you know i
originally just made this for collecting

6412
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:03,440
originally just made this for collecting
 

6413
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,550
originally just made this for collecting
ender pearls

6414
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:04,560
ender pearls
 

6415
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,070
ender pearls
and i was like wait a minute i'm getting

6416
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,080
and i was like wait a minute i'm getting
 

6417
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,550
and i was like wait a minute i'm getting
tons of xp doing this and uh

6418
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
tons of xp doing this and uh
 

6419
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,629
tons of xp doing this and uh
kind of realize this is one of the best

6420
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
kind of realize this is one of the best
 

6421
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:13,430
kind of realize this is one of the best
ways of making an xp farm in the game

6422
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
ways of making an xp farm in the game
 

6423
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,109
ways of making an xp farm in the game
again this was back when you needed 50

6424
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
again this was back when you needed 50
 

6425
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,590
again this was back when you needed 50
levels and all that kind of stuff

6426
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:17,600
levels and all that kind of stuff
 

6427
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,590
levels and all that kind of stuff
then eventually we outgrew that one and

6428
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:19,600
then eventually we outgrew that one and
 

6429
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,229
then eventually we outgrew that one and
we started the second enderman farm

6430
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
we started the second enderman farm
 

6431
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:24,070
we started the second enderman farm
out over this one this one's much more

6432
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
out over this one this one's much more
 

6433
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,830
out over this one this one's much more
refined we used the

6434
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:25,840
refined we used the
 

6435
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,990
refined we used the
vine trick that the zip crowd figured

6436
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
vine trick that the zip crowd figured
 

6437
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,070
vine trick that the zip crowd figured
out for stacking multiple

6438
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,080
out for stacking multiple
 

6439
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,790
out for stacking multiple
platforms together and yeah i remember

6440
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:32,800
platforms together and yeah i remember
 

6441
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,550
platforms together and yeah i remember
building this thing i think i stayed up

6442
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:34,560
building this thing i think i stayed up
 

6443
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,030
building this thing i think i stayed up
to

6444
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:35,040
to
 

6445
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,790
to
like 6 a.m that night took like over 10

6446
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:38,800
like 6 a.m that night took like over 10
 

6447
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,470
like 6 a.m that night took like over 10
hours or something crazy

6448
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
hours or something crazy
 

6449
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,709
hours or something crazy
this thing's huge lots and lots of

6450
01:48:42,709 --> 01:48:42,719
this thing's huge lots and lots of
 

6451
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:43,990
this thing's huge lots and lots of
layers to it

6452
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000
layers to it
 

6453
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,510
layers to it
the gimmick with this one though is i

6454
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,520
the gimmick with this one though is i
 

6455
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,950
the gimmick with this one though is i
figured out uh we could use tnt

6456
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:48,960
figured out uh we could use tnt
 

6457
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,550
figured out uh we could use tnt
and flame bows to farm them all at once

6458
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:52,560
and flame bows to farm them all at once
 

6459
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,790
and flame bows to farm them all at once
instead of using our sword

6460
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:54,800
instead of using our sword
 

6461
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,790
instead of using our sword
although i guess you can't uh do that

6462
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
although i guess you can't uh do that
 

6463
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,189
although i guess you can't uh do that
anymore can you

6464
01:48:59,189 --> 01:48:59,199
anymore can you
 

6465
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:02,229
anymore can you
oh the water puts the flame bow out now

6466
01:49:02,229 --> 01:49:02,239
oh the water puts the flame bow out now
 

6467
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:03,189
oh the water puts the flame bow out now
it didn't used to

6468
01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:03,199
it didn't used to
 

6469
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,310
it didn't used to
it would shoot through it

6470
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,320

 

6471
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,109

although this is gonna be hard to

6472
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
although this is gonna be hard to
 

6473
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:12,070
although this is gonna be hard to
demonstrate i guess this is broken now

6474
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:12,080
demonstrate i guess this is broken now
 

6475
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,270
demonstrate i guess this is broken now
we gotta shoot that and then put the

6476
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,280
we gotta shoot that and then put the
 

6477
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,709
we gotta shoot that and then put the
water back otherwise it'll blow up the

6478
01:49:14,709 --> 01:49:14,719
water back otherwise it'll blow up the
 

6479
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,629
water back otherwise it'll blow up the
farm

6480
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:16,639
farm
 

6481
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:17,830
farm
but yeah that's what it would do would

6482
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:17,840
but yeah that's what it would do would
 

6483
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,430
but yeah that's what it would do would
blow up all the enderman we get all the

6484
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:19,440
blow up all the enderman we get all the
 

6485
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,709
blow up all the enderman we get all the
xp still

6486
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:20,719
xp still
 

6487
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,629
xp still
and if we stood here all the xp orbs

6488
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
and if we stood here all the xp orbs
 

6489
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,550
and if we stood here all the xp orbs
would slowly flow towards us

6490
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:24,560
would slowly flow towards us
 

6491
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,629
would slowly flow towards us
and we got the enchanting station with

6492
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:26,639
and we got the enchanting station with
 

6493
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,470
and we got the enchanting station with
the cinderman farm we also had a system

6494
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:28,480
the cinderman farm we also had a system
 

6495
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,229
the cinderman farm we also had a system
for moving ender pearls through these

6496
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239
for moving ender pearls through these
 

6497
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,910
for moving ender pearls through these
water streams that would go up to the

6498
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:31,920
water streams that would go up to the
 

6499
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,709
water streams that would go up to the
main island

6500
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:32,719
main island
 

6501
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,790
main island
and then that would go through the ender

6502
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:34,800
and then that would go through the ender
 

6503
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,990
and then that would go through the ender
portal

6504
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
portal
 

6505
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,629
portal
back to the overworld in that uh true

6506
01:49:38,629 --> 01:49:38,639
back to the overworld in that uh true
 

6507
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,070
back to the overworld in that uh true
spawn thing we saw earlier in the

6508
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
spawn thing we saw earlier in the
 

6509
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,109
spawn thing we saw earlier in the
episode

6510
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:41,119
episode
 

6511
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,790
episode
so we can automatically store ender

6512
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:42,800
so we can automatically store ender
 

6513
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,790
so we can automatically store ender
pearls that way

6514
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:44,800
pearls that way
 

6515
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,950
pearls that way
off this direction is the ender ender

6516
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:46,960
off this direction is the ender ender
 

6517
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,750
off this direction is the ender ender
3.0 this is the one we currently use

6518
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:49,760
3.0 this is the one we currently use
 

6519
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,990
3.0 this is the one we currently use
and still works pretty good although

6520
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:52,000
and still works pretty good although
 

6521
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,430
and still works pretty good although
generally if you're building an enderman

6522
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
generally if you're building an enderman
 

6523
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,270
generally if you're building an enderman
farm it's better to build it lower in

6524
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280
farm it's better to build it lower in
 

6525
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,589
farm it's better to build it lower in
the world so you get better spawn rates

6526
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
the world so you get better spawn rates
 

6527
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,830
the world so you get better spawn rates
but uh yeah we got like a pixel arts

6528
01:49:59,830 --> 01:49:59,840
but uh yeah we got like a pixel arts
 

6529
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,109
but uh yeah we got like a pixel arts
design here

6530
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:01,119
design here
 

6531
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,350
design here
endermen looking ready to fight the

6532
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:03,360
endermen looking ready to fight the

they're mortal enemies um giant spawning

they're mortal enemies um giant spawning

endermites in a minecart and then they
