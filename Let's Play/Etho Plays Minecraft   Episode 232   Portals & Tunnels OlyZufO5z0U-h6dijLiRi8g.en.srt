129
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,830

and then they'll re-enter the blocks

130
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

131
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,750

hmm it actually takes them a while to

132
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
hmm it actually takes them a while to
 

133
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,949
hmm it actually takes them a while to
re-enter doesn't it

134
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959

 

135
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,630

138
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
just see what happens
 

139
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,830
just see what happens
might need to bring more of them over

140
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

141
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,309

here

142
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319

 

143
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,789

come on guys where are you at there

144
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
come on guys where are you at there
 

145
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,030
come on guys where are you at there
should be lots of them around

146
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040

 

147
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,309

and i'll never be able to kill them like

148
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
and i'll never be able to kill them like
 

149
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,149
and i'll never be able to kill them like
this because whenever they enter a block

150
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
this because whenever they enter a block
 

151
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,630
this because whenever they enter a block
again

152
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
again
 

153
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,509

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,590
here but this is a good start
this is a really good start uh maybe

180
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
this is a really good start uh maybe
 

181
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,270
this is a really good start uh maybe
next episode or something

182
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
next episode or something
 

183
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,790
next episode or something
we'll try this again with more

184
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800

 

185
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,070

well guys what's new what's going on

186
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
well guys what's new what's going on
 

187
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,749
well guys what's new what's going on
uh i think the only thing i've changed

188
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
uh i think the only thing i've changed
 

189
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,430
uh i think the only thing i've changed
since last episode i went to the nether

190
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
since last episode i went to the nether
 

191
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,670
since last episode i went to the nether
i did some work on the hub a little bit

192
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
i did some work on the hub a little bit
 

193
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,990
i did some work on the hub a little bit
just minor things and around here i

194
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
just minor things and around here i
 

195
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,550
just minor things and around here i
started to organize a little bit with

196
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
started to organize a little bit with
 

197
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,070
started to organize a little bit with
these chests this stuff is not

198
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
these chests this stuff is not
 

199
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,990
these chests this stuff is not
officially in place so

200
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
officially in place so
 

201
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,710
officially in place so
i'm just playing around with how all the

202
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
i'm just playing around with how all the
 

203
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,230
i'm just playing around with how all the
items fit together

204
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
items fit together
 

205
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,150
items fit together
in their groups um

206
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
in their groups um
 

207
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,510
in their groups um
and that's really hard to do there's so

208
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
and that's really hard to do there's so
 

209
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,749
and that's really hard to do there's so
many different items

210
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
many different items
 

211
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,390
many different items
and the thing is it's like what i gotta

212
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
and the thing is it's like what i gotta
 

213
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,990
and the thing is it's like what i gotta
do is i gotta collect one of everything

214
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
do is i gotta collect one of everything
 

215
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,189
do is i gotta collect one of everything
which is

216
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
which is
 

217
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,029
which is
really challenging actually

218
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
really challenging actually
 

219
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,070
really challenging actually
but yeah i'm working that out

220
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
but yeah i'm working that out
 

221
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,710
but yeah i'm working that out
let's go check out the end see how many

222
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
let's go check out the end see how many
 

223
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,070
let's go check out the end see how many
drops we get that's what we got right

224
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
drops we get that's what we got right
 

225
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,430
drops we get that's what we got right
now

226
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
now
 

227
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,510
now
now i have been afk for a long time so

228
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
now i have been afk for a long time so
 

229
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,550
now i have been afk for a long time so
if i don't get

230
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
if i don't get
 

231
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,830
if i don't get
at least like a stack and a half of

232
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
at least like a stack and a half of
 

233
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,790
at least like a stack and a half of
gunpowder

234
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
gunpowder
 

235
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,830
gunpowder
and i know that stuff is despawning or

236
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
and i know that stuff is despawning or
 

237
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,590
and i know that stuff is despawning or
at least i'm pretty sure

238
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600

 

239
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,390

did i yeah so something's wrong

240
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
did i yeah so something's wrong
 

241
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,070
did i yeah so something's wrong
something's definitely wrong it's gotta

242
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
something's definitely wrong it's gotta
 

243
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,029
something's definitely wrong it's gotta
be

244
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039

 

245
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,110

hmm i wonder what the deal is

246
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
hmm i wonder what the deal is
 

247
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,270
hmm i wonder what the deal is
i'm trying to think of an experiment we

248
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
i'm trying to think of an experiment we
 

249
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,469
i'm trying to think of an experiment we
could do where we could

250
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
could do where we could
 

251
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,990
could do where we could
actually time how long

252
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
actually time how long
 

253
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,749
actually time how long
the world loads when we send something

254
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
the world loads when we send something
 

255
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,070
the world loads when we send something
through a portal

256
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
through a portal
 

257
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,510
through a portal
that would be tough to do because i

258
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
that would be tough to do because i
 

259
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,309
that would be tough to do because i
think redstone

260
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
think redstone
 

261
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,309
think redstone
behaves weird i'm not sure

262
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319

 

263
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,830

i've done it before like i've had a

264
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
i've done it before like i've had a
 

265
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,909
i've done it before like i've had a
redstone circuit go

266
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
redstone circuit go
 

267
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,029
redstone circuit go
after i enter a portal and it always

268
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
after i enter a portal and it always
 

269
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,909
after i enter a portal and it always
completes itself so i don't

270
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
completes itself so i don't
 

271
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,870
completes itself so i don't
i don't know if it waits for that to

272
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
i don't know if it waits for that to
 

273
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,589
i don't know if it waits for that to
finish but

274
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
finish but
 

275
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,189
finish but
i don't think we could use redstone to

276
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
i don't think we could use redstone to
 

277
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,830
i don't think we could use redstone to
time it

278
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

279
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,909

um what are we doing today what are we

280
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
um what are we doing today what are we
 

281
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,270
um what are we doing today what are we
doing i don't know

282
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
doing i don't know
 

283
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,749
doing i don't know
what should we do what i kind of wanted

284
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759

 

285
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,390

you know that's actually i'll meet you

286
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
you know that's actually i'll meet you
 

287
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,350
you know that's actually i'll meet you
there one sec

288
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
there one sec
 

289
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,230
there one sec
so we're over here now i'm just here to

290
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
so we're over here now i'm just here to
 

291
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,830
so we're over here now i'm just here to
get the coordinates so we're at x

292
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840

 

293
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,670

540 just writing it down and zed

294
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
540 just writing it down and zed
 

295
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,790
540 just writing it down and zed
about 900.

296
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
about 900.
 

297
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,230
about 900.
y52 just in case we need it oops

298
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
y52 just in case we need it oops
 

299
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,309
y52 just in case we need it oops
i'm thinking about running a track from

300
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
i'm thinking about running a track from
 

301
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,270
i'm thinking about running a track from
here all the way to

302
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
here all the way to
 

303
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,870
here all the way to
over here which is at x

304
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
over here which is at x
 

305
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,950
over here which is at x
negative 245

306
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
negative 245
 

307
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,670
negative 245
and zed about 600

308
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680

 

309
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,950

hmm that's uh that's a little ways isn't

310
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
hmm that's uh that's a little ways isn't
 

311
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,830
hmm that's uh that's a little ways isn't
it that's

312
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
it that's
 

313
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,309
it that's
uh uh 300 block difference on the zed

314
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
uh uh 300 block difference on the zed
 

315
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,790
uh uh 300 block difference on the zed
and 200 or about 300 on

316
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
and 200 or about 300 on
 

317
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,909
and 200 or about 300 on
the x as well that's a ways you know

318
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
the x as well that's a ways you know
 

319
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,430
the x as well that's a ways you know
what i should do with that

320
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
what i should do with that
 

321
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,270
what i should do with that
that purifier thing is set up another

322
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
that purifier thing is set up another
 

323
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,110
that purifier thing is set up another
portal system for it so we could just

324
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
portal system for it so we could just
 

325
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,710
portal system for it so we could just
have another portal here

326
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
have another portal here
 

327
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,950
have another portal here
one over there and then it won't be all

328
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
one over there and then it won't be all
 

329
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,950
one over there and then it won't be all
that far to send villagers

330
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
that far to send villagers
 

331
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,990
that far to send villagers
because what i would like to do is

332
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
because what i would like to do is
 

333
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,390
because what i would like to do is
fix up this village since it's the

334
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
fix up this village since it's the
 

335
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,950
fix up this village since it's the
original one

336
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
original one
 

337
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,629
original one
in my world here where i got villagers

338
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
in my world here where i got villagers
 

339
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,230
in my world here where i got villagers
from

340
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
from
 

341
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,829
from
and they're all gone all of them

342
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

343
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,389

so

344
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
so
 

345
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,909
so
hmm i guess we could put a fence around

346

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
want to check out
 

407
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,870
want to check out
i wasn't sure what the final verdict was

408
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
i wasn't sure what the final verdict was
 

409
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,310
i wasn't sure what the final verdict was
on this in the game

410
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
on this in the game
 

411
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,790
on this in the game
can you can you send a mob in a minecart

412
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
can you can you send a mob in a minecart
 

413
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,790
can you can you send a mob in a minecart
through portal and have them

414
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
through portal and have them
 

415
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,710
through portal and have them
go through and if they go through do

416
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
go through and if they go through do
 

417
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,030
go through and if they go through do

they stay in the minecarts
 

419
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,550
they stay in the minecarts
that is what we're trying to figure out

420
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
that is what we're trying to figure out
 

421
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,630
that is what we're trying to figure out
first of all

422
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
first of all
 

423
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,230
first of all
so we'll just quickly set up a portal

424
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
so we'll just quickly set up a portal
 

425
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,670
so we'll just quickly set up a portal
and then we'll send one of these dummies

426
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
and then we'll send one of these dummies
 

427
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,110
and then we'll send one of these dummies
through

428
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120

 

429
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,790

501
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,430
okay so i tracked it down and to set up
a portal for

502
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
a portal for
 

503
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,190
a portal for
that purifier i think we got to put it

504

that purifier i think we got to put it
 

505
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,670
that purifier i think we got to put it
over here

506
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
over here
 

507
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,829
over here
pretty sure and it's not that much

508
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
pretty sure and it's not that much
 

509
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,190
pretty sure and it's not that much
farther away from this one but that's

510
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
farther away from this one but that's
 

511
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,590
farther away from this one but that's
okay uh it's far enough where we could

512
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
okay uh it's far enough where we could
 

513
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,910
okay uh it's far enough where we could
keep them separate if we want

514
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920

 

515
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,190

and has to go about right here
but it would cut through this other

566
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
but it would cut through this other
 

567
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,670
but it would cut through this other
tunnel i'm supposed to make for myself

568
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
tunnel i'm supposed to make for myself
 

569
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,790
tunnel i'm supposed to make for myself
so yeah we got to set some rules i think

570
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
so yeah we got to set some rules i think
 

571
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,230
so yeah we got to set some rules i think
in my world to keep things organized so

572
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
in my world to keep things organized so
 

573
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,110
in my world to keep things organized so
any silverfish dedicated tunnel i think

574
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
any silverfish dedicated tunnel i think
 

575
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
any silverfish dedicated tunnel i think
should go

576
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
should go
 

577
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,470
should go
like five blocks below my tunnels and

578
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
like five blocks below my tunnels and
 

579
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,350
like five blocks below my tunnels and
like for me and any village or tunnel

580
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
like for me and any village or tunnel
 

581
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,430
like for me and any village or tunnel
should maybe go five blocks above

582
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
should maybe go five blocks above
 

583
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,110
should maybe go five blocks above
any of my tunnels like them like uh

584
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
any of my tunnels like them like uh
 

585
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,670
any of my tunnels like them like uh
my tunnels are at y 65 i think

586
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680

 

587
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,069

i think that's what it is so if we go to

588
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
i think that's what it is so if we go to
 

589
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,910
i think that's what it is so if we go to
y70 or so

590
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
y70 or so
 

591
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,790
y70 or so
with the villagers that should be okay

592
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800

 

593
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,110

you know what's funny this pig you guys

594
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
you know what's funny this pig you guys

remember this pig
he's still in the well he's been there a

598
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
he's still in the well he's been there a
 

599
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,750
he's still in the well he's been there a
long

600
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
long
 

601
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,990
long
time he's getting all soggy

602
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
time he's getting all soggy
 

603
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,470
time he's getting all soggy
so if i figured this out right uh this

604
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
so if i figured this out right uh this
 

605
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,350
so if i figured this out right uh this
should link up

606
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
should link up
 

607
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,189
should link up
where i want it to in the nether

608
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
where i want it to in the nether
 

609
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,949
where i want it to in the nether
oh let's just put the portal right here

610
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
oh let's just put the portal right here
 

611
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,910
oh let's just put the portal right here
for now i guess

612
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920

 

613
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,350

we'll probably move it later

614
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360

 

615
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,350

and go right there

616
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360

 

617
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,310

okay let's see what happens where will

618
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
okay let's see what happens where will
 

619
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,310
okay let's see what happens where will

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,629
out that's good
and try it go the other way

628
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639

 

629
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,670

sweet

630
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680

 

631
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,389

yeah that's gonna work so with

632
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
yeah that's gonna work so with
 

633
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,189

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
so you don't need mine carts or anything
 

639
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,430
so you don't need mine carts or anything
for them

640
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
for them
 

641
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,590
for them
uh nor could you move that many with

642
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
uh nor could you move that many with
 

643
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,710
uh nor could you move that many with
minecarts

644
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
minecarts
 

645
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,269
minecarts
but the villagers they don't like to

646
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
but the villagers they don't like to
 

647
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,949
but the villagers they don't like to
cooperate and there's no

655
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,990
anything like that so
what we got to do is set up a track i

656
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
what we got to do is set up a track i
 

657
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,069
what we got to do is set up a track i
think

658
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
think
 

659
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,790
think
uh this portal i'm gonna align the other

660
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
uh this portal i'm gonna align the other
 

661
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,990
uh this portal i'm gonna align the other
way

662
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
way
 

663
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,189
way
and

664
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199

 

665
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,069

with this
 

669
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,829
with this
or not today anyway

670
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
or not today anyway
 

671
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,790
or not today anyway
i think i'll just get a track in here

672
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
i think i'll just get a track in here
 

673
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,030
i think i'll just get a track in here
real basic track

674
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
real basic track
 

675
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,390
real basic track
and just get it going

676
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400

 

677
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,150

690
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
one over here
 

691
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,990
one over here
tried one over here and what it comes

692
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
tried one over here and what it comes
 

693
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,390
tried one over here and what it comes
down to is i can't have it up this high

694
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
down to is i can't have it up this high
 

695
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,310
down to is i can't have it up this high
so if i go in it takes us where we want

696
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
so if i go in it takes us where we want
 

697
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,390
so if i go in it takes us where we want
it to take us

698
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
it to take us
 

699
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,430
it to take us
here but when we go through this one it

700
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
here but when we go through this one it
 

701
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,789
here but when we go through this one it
does not take us back

702
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
does not take us back
 

703
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,470
does not take us back
through that portal takes us to the

704
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
through that portal takes us to the
 

705
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,590
through that portal takes us to the
other one

706
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600

 

707
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,789

and the main reason is because this

708
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
and the main reason is because this
 

709
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,110
and the main reason is because this
portal

710
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120

 

711
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,350

this portal here will always be closer

712
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
this portal here will always be closer
 

713
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,430
this portal here will always be closer
than that one even if

714
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
than that one even if
 

715
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,070
than that one even if
even if that one's in the right position

716
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
even if that one's in the right position
 

717
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,590
even if that one's in the right position
like x and z

718
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
like x and z
 

719
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,070
like x and z
this one is closer on the y-coordinate

720
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
this one is closer on the y-coordinate
 

721
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,470
this one is closer on the y-coordinate
because it's down lower

722
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
because it's down lower
 

723
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,350
because it's down lower
so i'm gonna have to actually move it

724
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
so i'm gonna have to actually move it
 

725
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,669
so i'm gonna have to actually move it
down to where it was originally

726
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
down to where it was originally
 

727
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,990
down to where it was originally
oh boy so yeah

728
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
oh boy so yeah
 

729
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,070
oh boy so yeah
and i guess what i'll have to do is make

730
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
and i guess what i'll have to do is make
 

731
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,190
and i guess what i'll have to do is make
it go

732
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
it go
 

733
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,510
it go
make the villagers go uphill and still

734
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
make the villagers go uphill and still
 

735
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,190
make the villagers go uphill and still
have the tunnel up higher

736
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
have the tunnel up higher
 

737
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,150
have the tunnel up higher
would be better i think

738
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160

 

739
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,630

okay let's start laying down our fence

740
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
okay let's start laying down our fence
 

741
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,590
okay let's start laying down our fence
here

742
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
here
 

743
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,750
here
so with this village i think my first

744
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
so with this village i think my first
 

745
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,190
so with this village i think my first
priority is just going to be getting

746
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
priority is just going to be getting
 

747
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,909
priority is just going to be getting
life back

748
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
life back
 

749
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,190
life back
into it so

750
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
into it so
 

751
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,029
into it so
like this fence and anything

752
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
like this fence and anything
 

753
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,630
like this fence and anything
a lot of the things i build will

754
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
a lot of the things i build will
 

755
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,390
a lot of the things i build will
probably be temporary and if we want to

756
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
probably be temporary and if we want to
 

757
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,549
probably be temporary and if we want to
expand it later we can

758
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
expand it later we can
 

759
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,909
expand it later we can
i don't know if i'm going to do like

760
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
i don't know if i'm going to do like
 

761
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,110
i don't know if i'm going to do like
i don't know what i'm doing with it

762
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
i don't know what i'm doing with it
 

763
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,870
i don't know what i'm doing with it
basically i just want to get life to it

764
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
basically i just want to get life to it
 

765
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,510
basically i just want to get life to it
because

766
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
because
 

767
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,230
because
it it was a important village in this

768
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
it it was a important village in this
 

769
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,750
it it was a important village in this
world and it's dead right now

770
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
world and it's dead right now
 

771
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,789

axe like a diamond axe so uh the shovel

842
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
axe like a diamond axe so uh the shovel
 

843
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,270
axe like a diamond axe so uh the shovel
only costs one diamond

844
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
only costs one diamond
 

845
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,830
only costs one diamond
diamond axe costs three um

846
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840

 

847
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,230

it doesn't take any like it still only

848
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
it doesn't take any like it still only
 

849

for the shovel does

852
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
for the shovel does
 

853

for the shovel does
doesn't take any extra uses so it's

854
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
doesn't take any extra uses so it's
 

855
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,549
doesn't take any extra uses so it's
cheaper and also it's more versatile

856
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
cheaper and also it's more versatile
 

857
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,590
cheaper and also it's more versatile
because you can use it

858
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
