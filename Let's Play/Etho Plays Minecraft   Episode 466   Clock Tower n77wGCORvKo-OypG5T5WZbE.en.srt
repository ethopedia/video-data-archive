ladders

510
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079

 

511
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,430

might i better remove those just in case

front view camera whatever it is
you do the fall and then the fly and

532
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560

 

533
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,030

episode here today we're gonna try to do
 

537
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,910
episode here today we're gonna try to do
some building now

538
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
some building now
 

539
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,150
some building now
and i'm just like having fun figuring

540
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
and i'm just like having fun figuring
 

541
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,750
and i'm just like having fun figuring
out how to fly in third person view

542
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
out how to fly in third person view
 

543
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,550
out how to fly in third person view
there

544
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
there
 

545
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,829
there
getting a lot better at it now um

546
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
getting a lot better at it now um
 

547
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,350
getting a lot better at it now um
yeah so we're over here at the amplified

548
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
yeah so we're over here at the amplified
 

549
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,910
yeah so we're over here at the amplified
terrain base i have a project in mind

550
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
terrain base i have a project in mind
 

551
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,590
terrain base i have a project in mind
that i think is going to be pretty cool

552
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
that i think is going to be pretty cool
 

553
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,230
that i think is going to be pretty cool
if we can get it to work here

554
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
if we can get it to work here
 

555
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,430
if we can get it to work here
uh i want to try to build a clock tower

556
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
uh i want to try to build a clock tower
 

557
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,430
uh i want to try to build a clock tower
oh not enough altitude

558
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
oh not enough altitude
 

559
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,870
oh not enough altitude
you know what i didn't put on this bow

560
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
you know what i didn't put on this bow
 

561
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,470
you know what i didn't put on this bow
is unbreaking so it's like

562
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
is unbreaking so it's like
 

563
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,829
is unbreaking so it's like
breaking very quickly kind of a problem

564
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
breaking very quickly kind of a problem
 

565
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,350
breaking very quickly kind of a problem
uh gonna have to stop using it here

566
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
uh gonna have to stop using it here
 

567
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,389
uh gonna have to stop using it here
pretty soon oh no

568
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
pretty soon oh no
 

569
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,990
pretty soon oh no
i can't get up

570
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000

 

571
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,310

up into the sky up up and away all right

572
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
up into the sky up up and away all right
 

573
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,230
up into the sky up up and away all right
so i want to try to get over

574
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
so i want to try to get over
 

575
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,389
so i want to try to get over
over to there right yeah we're gonna try

576
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
over to there right yeah we're gonna try
 

577
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,030
over to there right yeah we're gonna try
to build a clock tower guys which uh

578
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
to build a clock tower guys which uh
 

579
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,870
to build a clock tower guys which uh
isn't a super difficult thing to do in

580
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
isn't a super difficult thing to do in
 

581
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,030
isn't a super difficult thing to do in
minecraft but to make a working

582
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
minecraft but to make a working
 

583
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,710
minecraft but to make a working
clock tower it's gonna be pretty tricky

584
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
clock tower it's gonna be pretty tricky
 

585
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,710
clock tower it's gonna be pretty tricky
i think it'll be a good challenge

586
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
i think it'll be a good challenge
 

587
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,710
i think it'll be a good challenge
and i wanna maybe build it like right

588
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
and i wanna maybe build it like right
 

589
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,190
and i wanna maybe build it like right
right up on the wall like above the the

590
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
right up on the wall like above the the
 

591
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,430
right up on the wall like above the the
tunnel here or else maybe up over there

592
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
tunnel here or else maybe up over there
 

593
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,949
tunnel here or else maybe up over there
it's got to be somewhere we can see it

594
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
it's got to be somewhere we can see it
 

595
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,110
it's got to be somewhere we can see it
though there's not a lot of spots

596
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
though there's not a lot of spots
 

597
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,910
though there's not a lot of spots
unless we're flying we would see it a

598
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
unless we're flying we would see it a
 

599
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,470
unless we're flying we would see it a
lot easier if it was up there

600
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
lot easier if it was up there
 

601
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,310
lot easier if it was up there
we'll think about it for a second here

602
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
we'll think about it for a second here
 

603
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,470
we'll think about it for a second here
but yeah to build a clock in minecraft

604
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
but yeah to build a clock in minecraft
 

605
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,230
but yeah to build a clock in minecraft
like not a digital clock i'm talking an

606
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
like not a digital clock i'm talking an
 

607
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,870
like not a digital clock i'm talking an
analog

608
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
analog
 

609
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,990
analog
12-hour clock with the with the hands

610
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
12-hour clock with the with the hands
 

611
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,110
12-hour clock with the with the hands
and all that stuff right

612
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
and all that stuff right
 

613
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,949
and all that stuff right
no minute hand just the hour hand

614
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
no minute hand just the hour hand
 

615
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,269
no minute hand just the hour hand
probably is all we're gonna do

616
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
probably is all we're gonna do
 

617
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,629
probably is all we're gonna do
uh is very difficult because

618
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
uh is very difficult because
 

619
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,550
uh is very difficult because
let's say we set the time on this clock

620
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
let's say we set the time on this clock
 

621
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,629
let's say we set the time on this clock
and then we leave the area here the time

622
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
and then we leave the area here the time
 

623
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,230
and then we leave the area here the time
in the game is still going to

624
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
in the game is still going to
 

625
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,829
in the game is still going to
keep running but the chunks are going to

626
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
keep running but the chunks are going to
 

627
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,269
keep running but the chunks are going to
unload here

628
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
unload here
 

629
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,710
unload here
so the clock's going to stop and then

630
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
so the clock's going to stop and then
 

631
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,990
so the clock's going to stop and then
when we come back it's going to be the

632
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
when we come back it's going to be the
 

633
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,590
when we come back it's going to be the
wrong time right

634
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
wrong time right
 

635
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,790
wrong time right
or if we sleep in a bed it's going to

636
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
or if we sleep in a bed it's going to
 

637
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,389
or if we sleep in a bed it's going to
change the time in game and the clock

638
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
change the time in game and the clock
 

639
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,310
change the time in game and the clock
isn't going to change so

640
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
isn't going to change so
 

641
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,310
isn't going to change so
how are we going to deal with that i am

642
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
how are we going to deal with that i am
 

643
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,710
how are we going to deal with that i am
not exactly sure

644
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
not exactly sure
 

645
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,870
not exactly sure
that is the challenge with this so i was

646
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
that is the challenge with this so i was
 

647
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,550
that is the challenge with this so i was
thinking about using daylight sensors

648
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
thinking about using daylight sensors
 

649
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,910
thinking about using daylight sensors
for it

650
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
for it
 

651
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,910
for it
uh but it turns out they're not super

652
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
uh but it turns out they're not super
 

653
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,629
uh but it turns out they're not super
good either because

654
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
good either because
 

655
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,350
good either because
they mostly detect oh hello

656
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
they mostly detect oh hello
 

657
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,150
they mostly detect oh hello
mr scary pants over here they mostly

658
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
mr scary pants over here they mostly
 

659
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,470
mr scary pants over here they mostly
detect like the sunrise and the sunset

660
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
detect like the sunrise and the sunset
 

661
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,990
detect like the sunrise and the sunset
that's when they change the most like

662
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
that's when they change the most like
 

663
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,949
that's when they change the most like
you can get a signal out of these

664
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
you can get a signal out of these
 

665
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,509
you can get a signal out of these
i'm not comfortable over here there's a

666
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
i'm not comfortable over here there's a
 

667
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,790
i'm not comfortable over here there's a
lot of

668
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
lot of

lot of
oh actually i might not have the oh i

670
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
oh actually i might not have the oh i
 

671
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,710
oh actually i might not have the oh i
don't have a nope

672
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
don't have a nope
 

673
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,150
don't have a nope
we're not on the side right now

674
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160

 

675
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,470

okay so i decided to hop into a creative

676
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
okay so i decided to hop into a creative
 

677
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,990
okay so i decided to hop into a creative
world just to show you guys this makes

678
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
world just to show you guys this makes
 

679
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,430
world just to show you guys this makes
it a lot easier

680
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
it a lot easier
 

681
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,030
it a lot easier
um the minecraft day is divided into 24

682
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
um the minecraft day is divided into 24
 

683
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,670
um the minecraft day is divided into 24
000 ticks so like every thousand is one

684
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
000 ticks so like every thousand is one
 

685
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,470
000 ticks so like every thousand is one
hour

686
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
hour
 

687
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,550
hour
in game one hour on the clock that we

688
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
in game one hour on the clock that we
 

689
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,470
in game one hour on the clock that we
want to want to show here

690
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
want to want to show here
 

691
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,509
want to want to show here
so if we go to 23 000 that's like 11

692
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
so if we go to 23 000 that's like 11
 

693
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,829
so if we go to 23 000 that's like 11
o'clock

694
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
o'clock
 

695
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,230
o'clock
in-game and you see the redstone is at

696
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
in-game and you see the redstone is at
 

697
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,509
in-game and you see the redstone is at
two right now

698
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
two right now
 

699
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,470
two right now
just switch to three if we go ahead one

700
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
just switch to three if we go ahead one
 

701
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,949
just switch to three if we go ahead one
hour

702
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
hour
 

703
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,350
hour
in game to twelve o'clock

704
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360

 

705
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,870

it goes way up like seven or eight right

706
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
it goes way up like seven or eight right
 

707
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,509
it goes way up like seven or eight right
so it's not like every one hour in game

708
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
so it's not like every one hour in game
 

709
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,550
so it's not like every one hour in game
moves the redstone

710
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
moves the redstone
 

711
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,790
moves the redstone
one block uh that makes it very

712
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
one block uh that makes it very
 

713
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,590
one block uh that makes it very
difficult to

714
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
difficult to
 

715
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,829
difficult to
to use this for timing the daylight

716
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
to use this for timing the daylight
 

717
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,110
to use this for timing the daylight
sensors here

718
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
sensors here
 

719
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,189
sensors here
but what we're going to use these for is

720
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
but what we're going to use these for is
 

721
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,949
but what we're going to use these for is
for re-syncing the clock

722
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
for re-syncing the clock
 

723
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,509
for re-syncing the clock
every day i think so we're going to use

724
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
every day i think so we're going to use
 

725
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,430
every day i think so we're going to use
like a hopper timer or something to

726
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
like a hopper timer or something to
 

727
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,590
like a hopper timer or something to
keep track of the time because that's

728
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
keep track of the time because that's
 

729
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,629
keep track of the time because that's
consistent

730
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
consistent
 

731
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,069
consistent
this is inconsistent

732
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079

 

733
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,389

and then like if we leave the chunks or

734
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
and then like if we leave the chunks or
 

735
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,910
and then like if we leave the chunks or
if we sleep in our bed

736
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
if we sleep in our bed
 

737
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,629
if we sleep in our bed
every day just after that we're gonna

738
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
every day just after that we're gonna
 

739
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,829
every day just after that we're gonna
set the the clock

740
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
set the the clock
 

741
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,430
set the the clock
again um using something like this if

742
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
again um using something like this if
 

743
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,150
again um using something like this if
you

744
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
you
 

745
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,310
you
this is a cool trick you can do with uh

746
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
this is a cool trick you can do with uh
 

747
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,670
this is a cool trick you can do with uh
comparators by the way

748
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
comparators by the way
 

749
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,990
comparators by the way
put a redstone torch then a repeater

750
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
put a redstone torch then a repeater
 

751
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,350
put a redstone torch then a repeater
hook them together and then another

752
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
hook them together and then another
 

753
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,949
hook them together and then another
redstone torch

754
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
redstone torch
 

755
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,590
redstone torch
this allows you to detect a specific

756
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
this allows you to detect a specific
 

757
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,430
this allows you to detect a specific
redstone distance so this will detect

758
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
redstone distance so this will detect
 

759
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,949
redstone distance so this will detect
the third one wherever the redstone

760
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
the third one wherever the redstone
 

761
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,310
the third one wherever the redstone
torch is here

762
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
torch is here
 

763
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,509
torch is here
uh so if we go to 22 000 for example

764
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
uh so if we go to 22 000 for example
 

765
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,670
uh so if we go to 22 000 for example
the redstone shuts off here if we go to

766
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
the redstone shuts off here if we go to
 

767
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,509
the redstone shuts off here if we go to
24 000 though it's going to turn it all

768
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
24 000 though it's going to turn it all
 

769
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,670
24 000 though it's going to turn it all
on again

770
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
on again
 

771
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,509
on again
but it didn't activate the note block

772
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
but it didn't activate the note block
 

773
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,030
but it didn't activate the note block
here it's only

774
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
here it's only
 

775
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,749
here it's only
if it's exactly three that it'll

776
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
if it's exactly three that it'll
 

777
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,350
if it's exactly three that it'll
activate so if we go to twenty three

778
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
activate so if we go to twenty three
 

779
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,389
activate so if we go to twenty three
thousand

780
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
thousand
 

781
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,310
thousand
it's at two right now

782
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320

 

783
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,069

jumps to three then it activates the

784
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
jumps to three then it activates the
 

785
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,829
jumps to three then it activates the
note block so that's how we can detect

786
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
note block so that's how we can detect
 

787
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,629
note block so that's how we can detect
when it's a certain time in the day like

788
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
when it's a certain time in the day like
 

789
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,990
when it's a certain time in the day like
right after we sleep

790
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
right after we sleep
 

791
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,310
right after we sleep
then we're going to set the clock and i

792
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
then we're going to set the clock and i
 

793
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,670
then we're going to set the clock and i
was just playing around with the layout

794
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
was just playing around with the layout
 

795
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,949
was just playing around with the layout
here i think this is what we're going to

796
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
here i think this is what we're going to
 

797
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,710
here i think this is what we're going to
go with it seems like a good spacing

798
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
go with it seems like a good spacing
 

799
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,389
go with it seems like a good spacing
between the hours here

800
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
between the hours here
 

801
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,829
between the hours here
so that would be twelve o'clock one

802
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
so that would be twelve o'clock one
 

803
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,590
so that would be twelve o'clock one
o'clock two o'clock three o'clock and so

804
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
o'clock two o'clock three o'clock and so
 

805
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,550
o'clock two o'clock three o'clock and so
on

806
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
on
 

807
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,870
on
um if you compress it smaller it just

808
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
um if you compress it smaller it just
 

809
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,230
um if you compress it smaller it just
doesn't look as good i don't think and

810
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
doesn't look as good i don't think and
 

811
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,910
doesn't look as good i don't think and
this makes it

812
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
this makes it
 

813
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,829
this makes it
pretty nice because we can draw a hand

814
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
pretty nice because we can draw a hand
 

815
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,350
pretty nice because we can draw a hand
like that

816
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
like that
 

817
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,670
like that
i will probably use pistons sticky

818
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
i will probably use pistons sticky
 

819
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,590
i will probably use pistons sticky
pistons to make the hand come out

820
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
pistons to make the hand come out
 

821
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,389
pistons to make the hand come out
too i think that'll work out pretty good

822
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
too i think that'll work out pretty good
 

823
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,949
too i think that'll work out pretty good
so we're back in our world again now and

824
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
so we're back in our world again now and
 

825
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,590
so we're back in our world again now and
i got

826
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
i got
 

827
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,910
i got
unbreaking three on the bow i put it on

828
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
unbreaking three on the bow i put it on
 

829
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,749
unbreaking three on the bow i put it on
fixed it up a little bit

830
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
fixed it up a little bit
 

831
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,110
fixed it up a little bit
and i have started on the clock

832
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
and i have started on the clock
 

833
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,230
and i have started on the clock
it uh it's gonna be crazy

834
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
it uh it's gonna be crazy
 

835
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,470
it uh it's gonna be crazy
you see all that green those are pistons

836
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
you see all that green those are pistons
 

837
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,470
you see all that green those are pistons
i don't know if we're gonna be able to

838
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
i don't know if we're gonna be able to
 

839
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,269
i don't know if we're gonna be able to
control it as well as i would like to

840
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
control it as well as i would like to
 

841
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,350
control it as well as i would like to
without having trouble with like budding

842
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
without having trouble with like budding
 

843
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,429
without having trouble with like budding
and stuff but we'll see

844
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
and stuff but we'll see
 

845
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,069
and stuff but we'll see
we will see and yeah we're not going to

846
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
we will see and yeah we're not going to
 

847
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,510
we will see and yeah we're not going to
worry too much about the looks today

848
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
worry too much about the looks today
 

849
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,110
worry too much about the looks today
we're just trying to get that working

850
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
we're just trying to get that working
 

851
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,069
we're just trying to get that working
but i would like the tower to be maybe

852
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
but i would like the tower to be maybe
 

853
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,949
but i would like the tower to be maybe
like

854
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
like
 

855
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,390
like
at least that tall and go down to

856
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
at least that tall and go down to
 

857
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,390
at least that tall and go down to
like there at least i'm going to remove

858
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
like there at least i'm going to remove
 

859
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,990
like there at least i'm going to remove
a lot of that land over there

860
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
a lot of that land over there
 

861
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,949
a lot of that land over there
and then make a flat spot for the tower

862
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
and then make a flat spot for the tower
 

863
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,029
and then make a flat spot for the tower
to sit on i think would look pretty cool

864
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
to sit on i think would look pretty cool
 

865
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,950
to sit on i think would look pretty cool
and i put it out way out there so

866
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
and i put it out way out there so
 

867
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,510
and i put it out way out there so
you know you can see it from a wide wide

868
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
you know you can see it from a wide wide
 

869
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,230
you know you can see it from a wide wide
range of angles hopefully

870
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
range of angles hopefully
 

871
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,950
range of angles hopefully
not just like if we're just up here

872
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
not just like if we're just up here
 

873
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,830
not just like if we're just up here
looking there

874
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
looking there
 

875
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,870
looking there
you know should be quite doable

876
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
you know should be quite doable
 

877
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,029
you know should be quite doable
over there so uh what i'm gonna do next

878
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
over there so uh what i'm gonna do next
 

879
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,830
over there so uh what i'm gonna do next
trying to figure out how to activate

880
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
trying to figure out how to activate
 

881
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,710
trying to figure out how to activate
these pistons probably

882
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
these pistons probably
 

883
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,750
these pistons probably
i don't know let's see where's the

884
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
i don't know let's see where's the
 

885
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,750
i don't know let's see where's the
center

886
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
center
 

887
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,390
center
this is gonna be nuts i might make it

888
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
this is gonna be nuts i might make it
 

889
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,070
this is gonna be nuts i might make it
where i get rid of these ones

890
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
where i get rid of these ones
 

891
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,669
where i get rid of these ones
just to make it a little bit easier on

892
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
just to make it a little bit easier on
 

893
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,870
just to make it a little bit easier on
myself but we'll see

894
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880

 

895
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,270

well i tried i really did try here

896
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
well i tried i really did try here
 

897
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,190
well i tried i really did try here
but i can't figure it out this is a head

898
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
but i can't figure it out this is a head
 

899
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,390
but i can't figure it out this is a head
scratcher

900
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
scratcher
 

901
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,750
scratcher
uh i almost think it's not possible

902
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
uh i almost think it's not possible
 

903
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,350
uh i almost think it's not possible
but this is a good challenge for you

904
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
but this is a good challenge for you
 

905
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,270
but this is a good challenge for you
guys maybe you can figure out a way

906
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
guys maybe you can figure out a way
 

907
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,590
guys maybe you can figure out a way
so i got i got that 12 o'clock working

908
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
so i got i got that 12 o'clock working
 

909
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,070
so i got i got that 12 o'clock working
you see the the hand comes out like that

910
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
you see the the hand comes out like that
 

911
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,750
you see the the hand comes out like that
no problem uh

912
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
no problem uh
 

913
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,070
no problem uh
where's it where is it there it is okay

914
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
where's it where is it there it is okay
 

915
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,350
where's it where is it there it is okay
then this one

916
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
then this one
 

917
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,950
then this one
i thought i was going clockwise but i

918
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
i thought i was going clockwise but i
 

919
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,669
i thought i was going clockwise but i
forgot i'm on the back side here so

920
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
forgot i'm on the back side here so
 

921
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,470
forgot i'm on the back side here so
i'm doing counterclockwise apparently

922
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
i'm doing counterclockwise apparently
 

923
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,590
i'm doing counterclockwise apparently
from where i started

924
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
from where i started
 

925
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,669
from where i started
so that's 11 o'clock that's working good

926
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
so that's 11 o'clock that's working good
 

927
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,110
so that's 11 o'clock that's working good
that's that's doing what it's supposed

928
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
that's that's doing what it's supposed
 

929
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,430
that's that's doing what it's supposed
to

930
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
to
 

931
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,150
to
no problem there uh but then beyond that

932
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
no problem there uh but then beyond that
 

933
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,590
no problem there uh but then beyond that
like that really tricky thing about

934
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
like that really tricky thing about
 

935
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,950
like that really tricky thing about
working with pistons is you got to be

936
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
working with pistons is you got to be
 

937
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,110
working with pistons is you got to be
careful of budding and all that stuff

938
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
careful of budding and all that stuff
 

939
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,430
careful of budding and all that stuff
and generally you need two blocks tall

940
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
and generally you need two blocks tall
 

941
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,630
and generally you need two blocks tall
to activate them um

942
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
to activate them um
 

943
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,990
to activate them um
which doesn't work when you have the

944
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
which doesn't work when you have the
 

945
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,750
which doesn't work when you have the
pistons all clumped together like i do

946
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
pistons all clumped together like i do
 

947
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,549
pistons all clumped together like i do
here

948
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
here
 

949
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,350
here
so that's 10 o'clock and you see there's

950
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
so that's 10 o'clock and you see there's
 

951
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,950
so that's 10 o'clock and you see there's
a piston there that's supposed to be out

952
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
a piston there that's supposed to be out
 

953
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,029
a piston there that's supposed to be out
and i just can't get it to

954
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
and i just can't get it to
 

955
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,669
and i just can't get it to
to work even to get this one to work as

956
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
to work even to get this one to work as
 

957
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,830
to work even to get this one to work as
well as it did i had to do like a

958
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
well as it did i had to do like a
 

959
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,430
well as it did i had to do like a
update trick here and uh

960
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
update trick here and uh
 

961
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,270
update trick here and uh
yeah beyond that it just kind of keeps

962
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
yeah beyond that it just kind of keeps
 

963
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,710
yeah beyond that it just kind of keeps
getting worse and worse i'm running out

964
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
getting worse and worse i'm running out
 

965
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,830
getting worse and worse i'm running out
of space here to

966
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
of space here to
 

967
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,510
of space here to
to do the wiring so

968
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
to do the wiring so
 

969
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,430
to do the wiring so
yeah not really sure what to do about

970
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
yeah not really sure what to do about
 

971
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,630
yeah not really sure what to do about
this

972
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
this
 

973
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,830
this
we might just have to only light up the

974
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
we might just have to only light up the
 

975
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,070
we might just have to only light up the
lamps

976
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
lamps
 

977
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,990
lamps
which kind of stinks

978
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000

 

979
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,230

alright guys so i decided to i just go

980
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
alright guys so i decided to i just go
 

981
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,990
alright guys so i decided to i just go
ahead with it here anyways it's not

982
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
ahead with it here anyways it's not
 

983
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,669
ahead with it here anyways it's not
going to be quite as cool as i have

984
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
going to be quite as cool as i have
 

985
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,510
going to be quite as cool as i have
originally hoped but

986
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
originally hoped but
 

987
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,830
originally hoped but
should be cool nonetheless we can

988
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
should be cool nonetheless we can
 

989
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,270
should be cool nonetheless we can
activate like three out of the four

990
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
activate like three out of the four
 

991
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,950
activate like three out of the four
pistons on the arm so

992
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
pistons on the arm so
 

993
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,150
pistons on the arm so
we'll see what it looks like hopefully

994
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
we'll see what it looks like hopefully
 

995
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,789
we'll see what it looks like hopefully
it's not too derpy um

996
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
it's not too derpy um
 

997
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,150
it's not too derpy um
this might be a really derpy build i

998
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
this might be a really derpy build i
 

999
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,070
this might be a really derpy build i
haven't built it yet so who knows how

1000
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
haven't built it yet so who knows how
 

1001
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,990
haven't built it yet so who knows how
it's going to turn out here

1002
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
it's going to turn out here
 

1003
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,230
it's going to turn out here
but let's see here what we got to do now

1004
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
but let's see here what we got to do now
 

1005
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,630
but let's see here what we got to do now
uh so all the arms are are sort of

1006
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
uh so all the arms are are sort of
 

1007
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,669
uh so all the arms are are sort of
figured out like how

1008
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
figured out like how
 

1009
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,669
figured out like how
how to activate the pistons and all

1010
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
how to activate the pistons and all
 

1011
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,190
how to activate the pistons and all
these levers that you see are the

1012
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
these levers that you see are the
 

1013
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,669
these levers that you see are the
connection points so this would be

1014
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
connection points so this would be
 

1015
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,870
connection points so this would be
the 12 o'clock one o'clock

1016
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
the 12 o'clock one o'clock
 

1017
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,149
the 12 o'clock one o'clock
two three four five six

1018
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
two three four five six
 

1019
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,110
two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven that's where

1020
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
seven eight nine ten eleven that's where
 

1021
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,070
seven eight nine ten eleven that's where
we have to connect

1022
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
we have to connect
 

1023
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,990
we have to connect
to make the arm pop out like that and

1024
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
to make the arm pop out like that and
 

1025
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,590
to make the arm pop out like that and
the light to turn on

1026
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
the light to turn on
 

1027
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,029
the light to turn on
um so if it's if it's three o'clock

1028
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
um so if it's if it's three o'clock
 

1029
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,870
um so if it's if it's three o'clock
for example we want that to be on

1030
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
for example we want that to be on
 

1031
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,630
for example we want that to be on
right but we don't want any of the other

1032
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
right but we don't want any of the other
 

1033
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,149
right but we don't want any of the other
arms to be on

1034
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
arms to be on
 

1035
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,789
arms to be on
uh which is a tricky thing but i realize

1036
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
uh which is a tricky thing but i realize
 

1037
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,149
uh which is a tricky thing but i realize
we can just do that trick we

1038
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
we can just do that trick we
 

1039
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,669
we can just do that trick we
we were planning on doing for sinking

1040
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
we were planning on doing for sinking
 

1041
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,830
we were planning on doing for sinking
the time as well with this

1042
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
the time as well with this
 

1043
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,990
the time as well with this
so this is not like the ideal place to

1044
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
so this is not like the ideal place to
 

1045
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,590
so this is not like the ideal place to
do redstone

1046
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
do redstone
 

1047
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,710
do redstone
kind of floating in the mid-air here uh

1048
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
kind of floating in the mid-air here uh
 

1049
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,990
kind of floating in the mid-air here uh
but yeah basically what we're going to

1050
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
but yeah basically what we're going to
 

1051
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,990
but yeah basically what we're going to
do is have a dropper

1052
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
do is have a dropper
 

1053
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,590
do is have a dropper
output a signal and then we'll do that

1054
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
output a signal and then we'll do that
 

1055
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,310
output a signal and then we'll do that
whole redstone torch repeater trick

1056
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
whole redstone torch repeater trick
 

1057
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,909
whole redstone torch repeater trick
that we did before and then then we'll

1058
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
that we did before and then then we'll
 

1059
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,430
that we did before and then then we'll
know if it's exactly

1060
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
know if it's exactly
 

1061
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,149
know if it's exactly
like one o'clock exactly two o'clock and

1062
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
like one o'clock exactly two o'clock and
 

1063
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,029
like one o'clock exactly two o'clock and
so on and so forth

1064
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
so on and so forth
 

1065
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,710
so on and so forth
all right so here we go guys i thought

1066
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
all right so here we go guys i thought
 

1067
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,470
all right so here we go guys i thought
i'd show you this before i add any more

1068
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
i'd show you this before i add any more
 

1069
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,350
i'd show you this before i add any more
onto it

1070
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
onto it
 

1071
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,029
onto it
because it's just going to get more and

1072
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
because it's just going to get more and
 

1073
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,789
because it's just going to get more and
more crazy looking

1074
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
more crazy looking
 

1075
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,230
more crazy looking
but it's actually very simple it's that

1076
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
but it's actually very simple it's that
 

1077
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,070
but it's actually very simple it's that
trick i showed you earlier with the

1078
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
trick i showed you earlier with the
 

1079
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,590
trick i showed you earlier with the
redstone torch and the repeater

1080
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
redstone torch and the repeater
 

1081
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,390
redstone torch and the repeater
it's just repeated many times here so

1082
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
it's just repeated many times here so
 

1083
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,310
it's just repeated many times here so
this device over here is what keeps

1084
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
this device over here is what keeps
 

1085
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,990
this device over here is what keeps
track of what time

1086
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
track of what time
 

1087
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,230
track of what time
to display on the clock depending on how

1088
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
to display on the clock depending on how
 

1089
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,149
to display on the clock depending on how
many swords are in the dropper

1090
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
many swords are in the dropper
 

1091
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,669
many swords are in the dropper
changes the hand on the clock so it's

1092
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
changes the hand on the clock so it's
 

1093
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,630
changes the hand on the clock so it's
it's actually a fairly simple concept so

1094
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
it's actually a fairly simple concept so
 

1095
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,270
it's actually a fairly simple concept so
we can

1096
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
we can
 

1097
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,710
we can
we can switch them between this dropper

1098
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
we can switch them between this dropper
 

1099
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,669
we can switch them between this dropper
and this one um

1100
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
and this one um
 

1101
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,270
and this one um
if we shut it all the way off here let's

1102
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
if we shut it all the way off here let's
 

1103
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,789
if we shut it all the way off here let's
go see what time it is i think it should

1104
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
go see what time it is i think it should
 

1105
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,830
go see what time it is i think it should
be

1106
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
be
 

1107
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,909
be
six something i realized

1108
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
six something i realized
 

1109
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,990
six something i realized
while doing this like the time zero in

1110
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
while doing this like the time zero in
 

1111
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,789
while doing this like the time zero in
minecraft is when the sun comes up right

1112
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
minecraft is when the sun comes up right
 

1113
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,990
minecraft is when the sun comes up right
but in the real world

1114
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
but in the real world
 

1115
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,630
but in the real world
you know the sun doesn't come up at noon

1116
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
you know the sun doesn't come up at noon
 

1117
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,350
you know the sun doesn't come up at noon
or at midnight uh so i had to

1118
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
or at midnight uh so i had to
 

1119
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,310
or at midnight uh so i had to
i decided to shift it over six hours so

1120
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
i decided to shift it over six hours so
 

1121
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,990
i decided to shift it over six hours so
the sun's gonna come up at

1122
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
the sun's gonna come up at
 

1123
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,390
the sun's gonna come up at
six am uh seven or eight am

1124
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
six am uh seven or eight am
 

1125
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,149
six am uh seven or eight am
might might have been better now that i

1126
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
might might have been better now that i
 

1127
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,310
might might have been better now that i
think of it but it's at 6am that's what

1128
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
think of it but it's at 6am that's what
 

1129
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,350
think of it but it's at 6am that's what
i did that's what we're going to live

1130
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
i did that's what we're going to live
 

1131
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,630
i did that's what we're going to live
with here

1132
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
with here
 

1133
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,230
with here
depending on where you live in the world

1134
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
depending on where you live in the world
 

1135
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,549
depending on where you live in the world
and what season is and all that stuff

1136
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
and what season is and all that stuff
 

1137
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,510
and what season is and all that stuff
affects it right we're going by harvest

1138
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
affects it right we're going by harvest
 

1139
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,990
affects it right we're going by harvest
harvest moon rules here

1140
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
harvest moon rules here
 

1141
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,669
harvest moon rules here
okay so 6am the sun rises um you can see

1142
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
okay so 6am the sun rises um you can see
 

1143
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,470
okay so 6am the sun rises um you can see
this wire is totally off uh when one

1144
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
this wire is totally off uh when one
 

1145
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,789
this wire is totally off uh when one
sword goes into here

1146
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
sword goes into here
 

1147
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,510
sword goes into here
this signal goes a distance of two that

1148
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
this signal goes a distance of two that
 

1149
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,669
this signal goes a distance of two that
shuts off this redstone torch so this is

1150
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
shuts off this redstone torch so this is
 

1151
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,789
shuts off this redstone torch so this is
the one that controls

1152
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
the one that controls
 

1153
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,990
the one that controls
the hour six hands so if this

1154
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
the hour six hands so if this
 

1155
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,190
the hour six hands so if this
wires off then the hour six is not

1156
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
wires off then the hour six is not
 

1157
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,350
wires off then the hour six is not
out anymore um then we do the trick here

1158
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
out anymore um then we do the trick here
 

1159
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,789
out anymore um then we do the trick here
so right now it's at this one so we

1160
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
so right now it's at this one so we
 

1161
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,430
so right now it's at this one so we
should be whoa i fall down

1162
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
should be whoa i fall down
 

1163
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,110
should be whoa i fall down
wait a minute getting really good at the

1164
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
wait a minute getting really good at the
 

1165
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,430
wait a minute getting really good at the
parkour here yeah so now we're on hour

1166
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
parkour here yeah so now we're on hour
 

1167
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,310
parkour here yeah so now we're on hour
seven

1168
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
seven
 

1169
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,669
seven
uh and you can see what i thought i'm

1170
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
uh and you can see what i thought i'm
 

1171
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,190
uh and you can see what i thought i'm
talking about with the the whole hand

1172
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
talking about with the the whole hand
 

1173
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,029
talking about with the the whole hand
being a little bit derpy

1174
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
being a little bit derpy
 

1175
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,750
being a little bit derpy
um yeah we're missing pistons

1176
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
um yeah we're missing pistons
 

1177
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,230
um yeah we're missing pistons
in places which i don't quite like but

1178
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
in places which i don't quite like but
 

1179
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,390
in places which i don't quite like but
it's better than nothing right

1180
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
it's better than nothing right
 

1181
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,710
it's better than nothing right
we got two swords in there shifts one

1182
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
we got two swords in there shifts one
 

1183
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,630
we got two swords in there shifts one
more hour on the clock

1184
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
more hour on the clock
 

1185
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,630
more hour on the clock
so it should be eight o'clock now and

1186
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
so it should be eight o'clock now and
 

1187
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,549
so it should be eight o'clock now and
then nine ten eleven twelve

1188
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
then nine ten eleven twelve
 

1189
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,230
then nine ten eleven twelve
i only got it up to 12 right now i

1190
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
i only got it up to 12 right now i
 

1191
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,830
i only got it up to 12 right now i
haven't done one two three four

1192
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
haven't done one two three four
 

1193
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,070
haven't done one two three four
five which is going to be the second

1194
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
five which is going to be the second
 

1195
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,669
five which is going to be the second
half we're just going to copy the same

1196
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
half we're just going to copy the same
 

1197
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,470
half we're just going to copy the same
concept over there

1198
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
concept over there
 

1199
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,789
concept over there
so once this gets to

1200
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799

 

1201
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,789

6 seven then we start adding to that one

1202
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
6 seven then we start adding to that one
 

1203
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,430
6 seven then we start adding to that one
um we'll need a device to to switch it

1204
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
um we'll need a device to to switch it
 

1205
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,230
um we'll need a device to to switch it
over

1206
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
over
 

1207
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,510
over
and then uh what we're gonna do

1208
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
and then uh what we're gonna do
 

1209
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,110
and then uh what we're gonna do
is every morning right after you sleep

1210
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
is every morning right after you sleep
 

1211
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,430
is every morning right after you sleep
we're gonna get all these swords to go

1212
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
we're gonna get all these swords to go
 

1213
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,190
we're gonna get all these swords to go
back

1214
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
back
 

1215
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,029
back
into this dropper that'll set it to 6

1216
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
into this dropper that'll set it to 6
 

1217
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,110
into this dropper that'll set it to 6
a.m on the clock there

1218
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
a.m on the clock there
 

1219
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,070
a.m on the clock there
basically and then every night we'll

1220
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
basically and then every night we'll
 

1221
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,510
basically and then every night we'll
probably use a moonlight

1222
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
probably use a moonlight
 

1223
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,070
probably use a moonlight
detector as well to sync it so every 12

1224
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
detector as well to sync it so every 12
 

1225
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,909
detector as well to sync it so every 12
hours we're going to resync the clock

1226
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
hours we're going to resync the clock
 

1227
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,669
hours we're going to resync the clock
basically

1228
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
basically
 

1229
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,789
basically
and then we're going to use a hopper

1230
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
and then we're going to use a hopper
 

1231
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,350
and then we're going to use a hopper
timer every thousand game ticks

1232
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
timer every thousand game ticks
 

1233
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,110
timer every thousand game ticks
to add one hour all right guys

1234
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
to add one hour all right guys
 

1235
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,590
to add one hour all right guys
so this episode is getting a little long

1236
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
so this episode is getting a little long
 

1237
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,510
so this episode is getting a little long
already here so i decided just to

1238
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
already here so i decided just to
 

1239
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,190
already here so i decided just to
uh plow through this get it done um

1240
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
uh plow through this get it done um
 

1241
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,110
uh plow through this get it done um
and it's just about all done here i'm

1242
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
and it's just about all done here i'm
 

1243
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,390
and it's just about all done here i'm
gonna run you through it here

1244
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
gonna run you through it here
 

1245
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,630
gonna run you through it here
in just a second but you can see we got

1246
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
in just a second but you can see we got
 

1247
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,470
in just a second but you can see we got
the hopper timer running there that's

1248
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
the hopper timer running there that's
 

1249
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,590
the hopper timer running there that's
supposed to add an

1250
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
supposed to add an
 

1251
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,830
supposed to add an
hour onto the clock every time it it

1252
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
hour onto the clock every time it it
 

1253
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,269
hour onto the clock every time it it
does a cycle

1254
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
does a cycle
 

1255
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,750
does a cycle
uh at the moment i got it really sped up

1256
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
uh at the moment i got it really sped up
 

1257
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,510
uh at the moment i got it really sped up
just so we can

1258
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
just so we can
 

1259
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,149
just so we can
see this changing quickly but that's

1260
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
see this changing quickly but that's
 

1261
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:56,789
see this changing quickly but that's
supposed to run

1262
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
supposed to run
 

1263
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,990
supposed to run
every 50 seconds of real time to

1264
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
every 50 seconds of real time to
 

1265
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,909
every 50 seconds of real time to
add one hour on the clock here um

1266
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
add one hour on the clock here um
 

1267
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,029
add one hour on the clock here um
the way this works we have a reset

1268
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
the way this works we have a reset
 

1269
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,470
the way this works we have a reset
right over here this is kind of where i

1270
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
right over here this is kind of where i
 

1271
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,510
right over here this is kind of where i
left off on it

1272
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520

 

1273
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,669

and basically the reset gets all these

1274
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
and basically the reset gets all these
 

1275
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,750
and basically the reset gets all these
swords back into this dropper here

1276
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
swords back into this dropper here
 

1277
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,110
swords back into this dropper here
sends it seven pulses or whatever

1278
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
sends it seven pulses or whatever
 

1279
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,909
sends it seven pulses or whatever
and that sets it back to six o'clock on

1280
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
and that sets it back to six o'clock on
 

1281
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,789
and that sets it back to six o'clock on
our clock here

1282
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
our clock here
 

1283
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,990
our clock here
so i'm just going to flip this real

1284
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
so i'm just going to flip this real
 

1285
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,149
so i'm just going to flip this real
quick and we'll go take a viewing spot

1286
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
quick and we'll go take a viewing spot
 

1287
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,110
quick and we'll go take a viewing spot
over here

1288
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
over here
 

1289
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,190
over here
you should be able to see it uh counting

1290
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
you should be able to see it uh counting
 

1291
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,870
you should be able to see it uh counting
okay so we missed six a.m but it's at

1292
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
okay so we missed six a.m but it's at
 

1293
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,549
okay so we missed six a.m but it's at
seven eight

1294
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559

 

1295
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,830

and nine kind of goes around the clock

1296
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
and nine kind of goes around the clock
 

1297
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,630
and nine kind of goes around the clock
here

1298
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
here
 

1299
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,950
here
when it gets to 5 it's going to stop and

1300
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
when it gets to 5 it's going to stop and
 

1301
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,830
when it gets to 5 it's going to stop and
what we got to do

1302
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
what we got to do
 

1303
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,909
what we got to do
is resync it using daylight and

1304
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
is resync it using daylight and
 

1305
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,510
is resync it using daylight and
moonlight sensors

1306
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520

 

1307
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,190

so that's that's the last part of this i

1308
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
so that's that's the last part of this i
 

1309
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,590
so that's that's the last part of this i
haven't done yet

1310
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
haven't done yet
 

1311
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,430
haven't done yet
but yeah it seems to seems to work

1312
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
but yeah it seems to seems to work
 

1313
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,190
but yeah it seems to seems to work
pretty good i need to

1314
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
pretty good i need to
 

1315
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,390
pretty good i need to
really figure out how i'm going to do

1316
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
really figure out how i'm going to do
 

1317
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,390
really figure out how i'm going to do
this face on this clock how to make it

1318
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
this face on this clock how to make it
 

1319
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,110
this face on this clock how to make it
look good

1320
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
look good
 

1321
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,110
look good
as soon as we add some blocks over top

1322
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
as soon as we add some blocks over top
 

1323
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,870
as soon as we add some blocks over top
of it it's going to create more shadows

1324
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
of it it's going to create more shadows
 

1325
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,549
of it it's going to create more shadows
on the clock and it'll look a lot better

1326
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
on the clock and it'll look a lot better
 

1327
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,630
on the clock and it'll look a lot better
than it is currently because right now

1328
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
than it is currently because right now
 

1329
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,310
than it is currently because right now
it's kind of exposed to the sunlight

1330
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
it's kind of exposed to the sunlight
 

1331
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,789
it's kind of exposed to the sunlight
um yeah so it goes to 5

1332
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
um yeah so it goes to 5
 

1333
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,710
um yeah so it goes to 5
and then before it goes to 6 we would

1334
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
and then before it goes to 6 we would
 

1335
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,990
and then before it goes to 6 we would
resync it again

1336
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000

 

1337
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,350

otherwise it's just going to shut off

1338
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
otherwise it's just going to shut off
 

1339
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,149
otherwise it's just going to shut off
like that is the plan

1340
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
like that is the plan
 

1341
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,070
like that is the plan
so to resync it is

1342
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080

 

1343
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,789

a relatively simple thing to do here

1344
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799

 

1345
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,110

if he can get around oh getting lag

1346
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
if he can get around oh getting lag
 

1347
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,990
if he can get around oh getting lag
spikes too it's not

1348
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
spikes too it's not
 

1349
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,470
spikes too it's not
helping

1350
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480

 

1351
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,870

okay okay so i'm trying to hurry here

1352
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
okay okay so i'm trying to hurry here
 

1353
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,789
okay okay so i'm trying to hurry here
before the sun comes up

1354
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
before the sun comes up
 

1355
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,110
before the sun comes up
we can test this out i got a daylight

1356
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
we can test this out i got a daylight
 

1357
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,390
we can test this out i got a daylight
sensor set up there

1358
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
sensor set up there
 

1359
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,549
sensor set up there
uh what i figured out in creative before

1360
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
uh what i figured out in creative before
 

1361
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,510
uh what i figured out in creative before
is if i

1362
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
is if i
 

1363
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,350
is if i
uh run at a distance of seven that's

1364
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
uh run at a distance of seven that's
 

1365
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,590
uh run at a distance of seven that's
right after you wake up in a bed

1366
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
right after you wake up in a bed
 

1367
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,990
right after you wake up in a bed
which is probably the best time to

1368
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
which is probably the best time to
 

1369
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,390
which is probably the best time to
resync the clock so if we ever sleep

1370
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
resync the clock so if we ever sleep
 

1371
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,510
resync the clock so if we ever sleep
it's going to be the right time

1372
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
it's going to be the right time
 

1373
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,630
it's going to be the right time
basically um what we got to do is just

1374
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
basically um what we got to do is just
 

1375
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,149
basically um what we got to do is just
connect to over here

1376
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
connect to over here
 

1377
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,310
connect to over here
let's kind of put this in a random

1378
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
let's kind of put this in a random
 

1379
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,190
let's kind of put this in a random
random spot

1380
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
random spot
 

1381
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,070
random spot
i'll have to move it later but i just

1382
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,080
i'll have to move it later but i just
 

1383
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,669
i'll have to move it later but i just
want to try this

1384
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
want to try this
 

1385
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,590
want to try this
okay do this so that's going to

1386
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
okay do this so that's going to
 

1387
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,190
okay do this so that's going to
turn on uh right when we sleep here

1388
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
turn on uh right when we sleep here
 

1389
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,029
turn on uh right when we sleep here
let's go get our bed quickly

1390
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039

 

1391
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,870

and we should be able to see the clock

1392
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
and we should be able to see the clock
 

1393
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,269
and we should be able to see the clock
turn to

1394
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
turn to
 

1395
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,510
turn to
six right i believe right okay

1396
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520

 

1397
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,750

oh actually do we have time let's turn

1398
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
oh actually do we have time let's turn
 

1399
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,190
oh actually do we have time let's turn
the clock on yeah we got a little bit of

1400
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
the clock on yeah we got a little bit of
 

1401
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,830
the clock on yeah we got a little bit of
time here

1402
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
time here
 

1403
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,710
time here
let's turn the clock on again and we'll

1404
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
let's turn the clock on again and we'll
 

1405
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,230
let's turn the clock on again and we'll
try to re-sync it while it's running

1406
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
try to re-sync it while it's running
 

1407
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,590
try to re-sync it while it's running
here

1408
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
here
 

1409
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,590
here
just to show you that it can be done so

1410
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
just to show you that it can be done so
 

1411
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,590
just to show you that it can be done so
i'm going to flip the lever

1412
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
i'm going to flip the lever
 

1413
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,350
i'm going to flip the lever
can you tell i had no torches while

1414
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
can you tell i had no torches while
 

1415
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,549
can you tell i had no torches while
while building this whole thing

1416
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559
while building this whole thing
 

1417
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,430
while building this whole thing
all right yeah so we'll do that we'll

1418
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
all right yeah so we'll do that we'll
 

1419
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,990
all right yeah so we'll do that we'll
get it running

1420
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
get it running
 

1421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,389
get it running
again oh

1422
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
again oh
 

1423
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,549
again oh
and i guess let's sleep over here so

1424
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
and i guess let's sleep over here so
 

1425
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,310
and i guess let's sleep over here so
yeah you see it's running up over there

1426
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
yeah you see it's running up over there
 

1427
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,909
yeah you see it's running up over there
so when we sleep in our bed it's gonna

1428
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
so when we sleep in our bed it's gonna
 

1429
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,909
so when we sleep in our bed it's gonna
turn it back to six o'clock

1430
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
turn it back to six o'clock
 

1431
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,590
turn it back to six o'clock
that's what it's supposed to do anyway

1432
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
that's what it's supposed to do anyway
 

1433
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,470
that's what it's supposed to do anyway
okay here we go and then again we gotta

1434
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
okay here we go and then again we gotta
 

1435
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,070
okay here we go and then again we gotta
do that with a moonlight sensor as well

1436
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
do that with a moonlight sensor as well
 

1437
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,070
do that with a moonlight sensor as well
i think that would probably be at seven

1438
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
i think that would probably be at seven
 

1439
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,669
i think that would probably be at seven
distance as well oh oh

1440
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
distance as well oh oh
 

1441
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,389
distance as well oh oh
oh wow it actually works like that okay

1442
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
oh wow it actually works like that okay
 

1443
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,990
oh wow it actually works like that okay
you can actually see it go back that's

1444
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
you can actually see it go back that's
 

1445
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,430
you can actually see it go back that's
weird

1446
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440

 

1447
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,669

all right so are you confused as i am

1448
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
all right so are you confused as i am
 

1449
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,470
all right so are you confused as i am
basically what we're doing though we're

1450
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
basically what we're doing though we're
 

1451
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,990
basically what we're doing though we're
gonna have a moonlight sensor as well

1452
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
gonna have a moonlight sensor as well
 

1453
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,310
gonna have a moonlight sensor as well
to set it to 6 p.m when it's that time

1454
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
to set it to 6 p.m when it's that time
 

1455
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,350
to set it to 6 p.m when it's that time
and as long as we're in this area for at

1456
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
and as long as we're in this area for at
 

1457
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,430
and as long as we're in this area for at
least 10 minutes at the absolute longest

1458
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
least 10 minutes at the absolute longest
 

1459
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,190
least 10 minutes at the absolute longest
or if we sleep

1460
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
or if we sleep
 

1461
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,950
or if we sleep
at any time it's going to set it to the

1462
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
at any time it's going to set it to the
 

1463
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,950
at any time it's going to set it to the
correct time on the clock again

1464
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
correct time on the clock again
 

1465
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,789
correct time on the clock again
so that way if we leave the area and

1466
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
so that way if we leave the area and
 

1467
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,789
so that way if we leave the area and
come back and the chunks unload

1468
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
come back and the chunks unload
 

1469
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,350
come back and the chunks unload
that's not going to be an issue it'll

1470
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
that's not going to be an issue it'll
 

1471
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,870
that's not going to be an issue it'll
it'll fix itself

1472
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
it'll fix itself
 

1473
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,269
it'll fix itself
is the whole concept of this clock so i

1474
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
is the whole concept of this clock so i
 

1475
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,190
is the whole concept of this clock so i
think that's pretty cool

1476
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
think that's pretty cool
 

1477
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,110
think that's pretty cool
pretty cool so um

1478
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
pretty cool so um
 

1479
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,710
pretty cool so um
just run you through it quickly we saw

1480
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
just run you through it quickly we saw
 

1481
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,190
just run you through it quickly we saw
most of this again it looks crazy and

1482
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
most of this again it looks crazy and
 

1483
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,029
most of this again it looks crazy and
complicated that's just uh

1484
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:21,039
complicated that's just uh
 

1485
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,950
complicated that's just uh
that trick we did repeated many times

1486
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
that trick we did repeated many times
 

1487
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,310
that trick we did repeated many times
and i had to connect

1488
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
and i had to connect
 

1489
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,389
and i had to connect
each of those to one of the one of the

1490
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
each of those to one of the one of the
 

1491
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,510
each of those to one of the one of the
hands on the clock

1492
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
hands on the clock
 

1493
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,430
hands on the clock
so that made a lot of wiring here that

1494
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
so that made a lot of wiring here that
 

1495
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,669
so that made a lot of wiring here that
that's what makes this look confusing

1496
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
that's what makes this look confusing
 

1497
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,669
that's what makes this look confusing
but from the daylight detector and the

1498
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
but from the daylight detector and the
 

1499
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,110
but from the daylight detector and the
moonlight detector

1500
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
moonlight detector
 

1501
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,110
moonlight detector
um whenever we want to reset it to six

1502
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
um whenever we want to reset it to six
 

1503
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,149
um whenever we want to reset it to six
o'clock

1504
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
o'clock
 

1505
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,190
o'clock
uh we pull the signal from that send it

1506
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
uh we pull the signal from that send it
 

1507
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,510
uh we pull the signal from that send it
down this line here

1508
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
down this line here
 

1509
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,750
down this line here
got a little monostable circuit there to

1510
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
got a little monostable circuit there to
 

1511
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,870
got a little monostable circuit there to
make sure

1512
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
make sure
 

1513
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,789
make sure
uh it doesn't stay on for long i don't

1514
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
uh it doesn't stay on for long i don't
 

1515
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,549
uh it doesn't stay on for long i don't
think that's important actually

1516
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
think that's important actually
 

1517
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,190
think that's important actually
then we have a well actually it kind of

1518
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
then we have a well actually it kind of
 

1519
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,389
then we have a well actually it kind of
matters because otherwise

1520
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
matters because otherwise
 

1521
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,950
matters because otherwise
a clock would run for a long time here

1522
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
a clock would run for a long time here
 

1523
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,950
a clock would run for a long time here
but we have a pulse extender here

1524
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
but we have a pulse extender here
 

1525
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,870
but we have a pulse extender here
to make sure at least seven pulses get

1526
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
to make sure at least seven pulses get
 

1527
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,549
to make sure at least seven pulses get
sent to the reset

1528
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
sent to the reset
 

1529
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,070
sent to the reset
comparator clock which sends the pulses

1530
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
comparator clock which sends the pulses
 

1531
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
comparator clock which sends the pulses
uh those go down to here so this is our

1532
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
uh those go down to here so this is our
 

1533
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,990
uh those go down to here so this is our
reset line over here

1534
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
reset line over here
 

1535
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,870
reset line over here
this is our addition line right right

1536
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
this is our addition line right right
 

1537
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,909
this is our addition line right right
over here that the

1538
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
over here that the
 

1539
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,630
over here that the
the hopper timer is running to so every

1540
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:18,640
the hopper timer is running to so every
 

1541
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,549
the hopper timer is running to so every
time it goes over this it adds

1542
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
time it goes over this it adds
 

1543
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,870
time it goes over this it adds
to this dropper and you can see we got a

1544
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
to this dropper and you can see we got a
 

1545
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,510
to this dropper and you can see we got a
little piston mechanism here

1546
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
little piston mechanism here
 

1547
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,789
little piston mechanism here
uh this only goes up once once all the

1548
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
uh this only goes up once once all the
 

1549
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,630
uh this only goes up once once all the
swords are out of this dropper

1550
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
swords are out of this dropper
 

1551
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,470
swords are out of this dropper
so then it starts adding to this one i

1552
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
so then it starts adding to this one i
 

1553
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,710
so then it starts adding to this one i
had to split it into two

1554
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
had to split it into two
 

1555
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,269
had to split it into two
because there's only nine spots in the

1556
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
because there's only nine spots in the
 

1557
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,830
because there's only nine spots in the
dropper inventory and there's 12 hours

1558
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
dropper inventory and there's 12 hours
 

1559
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,950
dropper inventory and there's 12 hours
on a clock right another way i could

1560
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
on a clock right another way i could
 

1561
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,630
on a clock right another way i could
have done it is use ender pearls

1562
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
have done it is use ender pearls
 

1563
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,350
have done it is use ender pearls
and just like detect the signal from 0

1564
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
and just like detect the signal from 0
 

1565
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,789
and just like detect the signal from 0
to 15

1566
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
to 15
 

1567
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,510
to 15
and do 0 from 12 that way but i kind of

1568
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
and do 0 from 12 that way but i kind of
 

1569
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,269
and do 0 from 12 that way but i kind of
want the signal to spread out further

1570
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
want the signal to spread out further
 

1571
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,510
want the signal to spread out further
here so that i'd have space to

1572
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
here so that i'd have space to
 

1573
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,789
here so that i'd have space to
to do this trick here um

1574
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
to do this trick here um
 

1575
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,509
to do this trick here um
but yeah anyways that's really all there

1576
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
but yeah anyways that's really all there
 

1577
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,710
but yeah anyways that's really all there
is to it

1578
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
is to it
 

1579
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,549
is to it
complicated confusing yes yes yes

1580
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
complicated confusing yes yes yes
 

1581
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,470
complicated confusing yes yes yes
hope uh hope i made some sense there

1582
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
hope uh hope i made some sense there
 

1583
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,990
hope uh hope i made some sense there
though and uh

1584
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
though and uh
 

1585
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,590
though and uh
basically got the clock done here i'm

1586
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
basically got the clock done here i'm
 

1587
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,350
basically got the clock done here i'm
gonna have to do a couple more a couple

1588
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,360
gonna have to do a couple more a couple
 

1589
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,190
gonna have to do a couple more a couple
more things in testing

1590
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
more things in testing
 

1591
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,269
more things in testing
and then we can build our actual tower

1592
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
and then we can build our actual tower
 

1593
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,230
and then we can build our actual tower
which will

1594
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
which will
 

1595
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,950
which will
make it look cool hopefully

1596
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960

 

1597
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,990

whoa don't see that too often uh so on a

1598
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
whoa don't see that too often uh so on a
 

1599
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,470
whoa don't see that too often uh so on a
sad note guys unfortunately

1600
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
sad note guys unfortunately
 

1601
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,710
sad note guys unfortunately
polar bears are gone i don't know what

1602
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
polar bears are gone i don't know what
 

1603
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,549
polar bears are gone i don't know what
happened like when i left

1604
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
happened like when i left
 

1605
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,070
happened like when i left
they were here like when i went through

1606
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
they were here like when i went through
 

1607
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,909
they were here like when i went through
the portal to the amplified terrain they

1608
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
the portal to the amplified terrain they
 

1609
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,789
the portal to the amplified terrain they
were here

1610
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
were here
 

1611
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,990
were here
when i came back they were gone

1612
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,000
when i came back they were gone
 

1613
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,310
when i came back they were gone
so yeah maybe you guys can fill me in do

1614
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
so yeah maybe you guys can fill me in do
 

1615
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,590
so yeah maybe you guys can fill me in do
they despawn

1616
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
they despawn
 

1617
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,190
they despawn
because i don't know much about them to

1618
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
because i don't know much about them to
 

1619
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,630
because i don't know much about them to
be honest

1620
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
be honest
 

1621
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,310
be honest
and i couldn't see any drops in the

1622
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
and i couldn't see any drops in the
 

1623
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,310
and i couldn't see any drops in the
water here like no fish

1624
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
water here like no fish
 

1625
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,950
water here like no fish
from them dying so i'm kind of thinking

1626
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
from them dying so i'm kind of thinking
 

1627
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,950
from them dying so i'm kind of thinking
they despawned somehow

1628
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
they despawned somehow
 

1629
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,430
they despawned somehow
but one other thing though i believe

1630
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440
but one other thing though i believe
 

1631
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,070
but one other thing though i believe
this area here might be part of my spawn

1632
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
this area here might be part of my spawn
 

1633
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,750
this area here might be part of my spawn
chunks so possibly

1634
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
chunks so possibly
 

1635
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,750
chunks so possibly
the area was loaded while i was at the

1636
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
the area was loaded while i was at the
 

1637
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,269
the area was loaded while i was at the
amplified terrain base

1638
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
amplified terrain base
 

1639
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,870
amplified terrain base
and they could either kill themselves or

1640
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
and they could either kill themselves or
 

1641
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,110
