I haven't put forth the effort to learn

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,010
I haven't put forth the effort to learn
 

41
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,390
I haven't put forth the effort to learn
them I I think anybody can learn them to

42
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
them I I think anybody can learn them to
 

43
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,539
them I I think anybody can learn them to
a certain degree anyway just by putting

44
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:08,549
a certain degree anyway just by putting
 

45
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,690
a certain degree anyway just by putting
effort until actually learning them and

46
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:10,700
effort until actually learning them and
 

47
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,090
effort until actually learning them and
I think the the time that actually

48
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,100
I think the the time that actually
 

49
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,160
I think the the time that actually
started changing with me is when I start

50
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,170
started changing with me is when I start
 

51
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,780
started changing with me is when I start
playing minecraft because a lot of what

52
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:17,790
playing minecraft because a lot of what
 

53
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,399
playing minecraft because a lot of what
you do in Minecraft is like building

54
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:19,409
you do in Minecraft is like building
 

55
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,399
you do in Minecraft is like building
things and then looking at them and

56
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:22,409
things and then looking at them and
 

57
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,260
things and then looking at them and
deciding if you like them or not and

58
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,270
deciding if you like them or not and
 

59
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,999
deciding if you like them or not and
then comparing them with other things I

60
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,009
then comparing them with other things I
 

61
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,280
then comparing them with other things I
used to see like stuff people built in

62
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,290
used to see like stuff people built in
 

63
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,020

67
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,300
like that but I didn't know why and now
most of the time I can answer why I like

68
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,310
most of the time I can answer why I like
 

69
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,890
most of the time I can answer why I like
that or why something is better than

70
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:36,900
that or why something is better than
 

71
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,190
that or why something is better than
than something else so I feel to a

72
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
than something else so I feel to a
 

73
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,399
than something else so I feel to a
certain extent I've learned arts may be

74
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:43,409

75
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,190

the bare basics right but it's learn
 

77
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,700
the bare basics right but it's learn
about right even like colors before I

78
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:49,710
about right even like colors before I
 

79
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,499
about right even like colors before I
start playing minecraft I could not put

80
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:51,509
start playing minecraft I could not put
 

81
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,810
start playing minecraft I could not put
colors together at all and now I have

colors together at all and now I have
 

83
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,510

heard things that if you don't learn
 

93
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,690
heard things that if you don't learn
perfect pitch before you're 8 years old

94

perfect pitch before you're 8 years old
 

95
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,580
perfect pitch before you're 8 years old
that you'll you'll never be able to

96
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590
that you'll you'll never be able to
 

97
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,140
that you'll you'll never be able to
learn it but I've seen things now that

98
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,150
learn it but I've seen things now that
 

99
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,670
learn it but I've seen things now that
it's like people with perfect pitch it's

100
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
it's like people with perfect pitch it's
 

101
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,070
it's like people with perfect pitch it's
not actually something that necessarily

102
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,080
not actually something that necessarily

to effort basically that's my

108
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,650
to effort basically that's my
 

109
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,410
to effort basically that's my
perspective now you guys can disagree

110
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,420

with me in the comments maybe there is

112
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,670
with me in the comments maybe there is
 

113
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,720
with me in the comments maybe there is
some natural affinity or talents

114
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:28,730
some natural affinity or talents
 

115
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,160
some natural affinity or talents
associated with becoming among the best

in the world I think in general anybody
 

119
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,110
in the world I think in general anybody
can learn something right uh-huh

120
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
can learn something right uh-huh
 

121
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,640
can learn something right uh-huh
anyways there is actually a point to all

122
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:37,650
anyways there is actually a point to all
 

123
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,589
anyways there is actually a point to all
this there's a reason I'm bringing it up

basically I've been trying to learn
 

129
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,290
basically I've been trying to learn
music theory lately putting forth an

music theory lately putting forth an
 

131
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,140
music theory lately putting forth an
effort into that with very little effort

132
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,150
effort into that with very little effort

together why don't we play everything
 

141
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,089
together why don't we play everything
and see stuff like that like I've learnt

142
00:02:59,089 --> 00:02:59,099
and see stuff like that like I've learnt
 

143
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,309
and see stuff like that like I've learnt
that learnt a little bit about reading

144
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:01,319
that learnt a little bit about reading
 

145
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,350
that learnt a little bit about reading
notes like I knew how to play tabs on a

didn't actually know how the notes were

152
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
didn't actually know how the notes were
 

153
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,770
didn't actually know how the notes were
laid out on the guitar stuff like that

154
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:11,780
laid out on the guitar stuff like that
 

155
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,850

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,580
Minecraft here that's that's the reason
for this long explanation anyways here

170

just the like part of the melody I

176
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,680
just the like part of the melody I
 

177
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,679
just the like part of the melody I
didn't do the full song or anything like

178
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:06,689
didn't do the full song or anything like
 

179
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,780
didn't do the full song or anything like
that ah let's get to some of the

180
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:08,790
that ah let's get to some of the
 

181
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,640
that ah let's get to some of the
mechanics here so to play the song we

182
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,650
mechanics here so to play the song we
 

183
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,160
mechanics here so to play the song we
just opened the trapdoor activates an

184
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,170
just opened the trapdoor activates an
 

185
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,280
just opened the trapdoor activates an
observer here and then stop it we close

186
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,290
observer here and then stop it we close
 

187
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,610
observer here and then stop it we close
it

188
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:16,620
it
 

189
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,860
it
it'll keep playing on a loop as long as

190
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:18,870
it'll keep playing on a loop as long as
 

191
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,810
it'll keep playing on a loop as long as
that trap door is open like endlessly

192
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:20,820
that trap door is open like endlessly
 

193
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,379
that trap door is open like endlessly
and the range is actually pretty good I

194
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:26,389
and the range is actually pretty good I
 

195
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,129
and the range is actually pretty good I
didn't hear it all the way over here

196
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:28,139
didn't hear it all the way over here
 

197
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,620
didn't hear it all the way over here
which is cool once you get like out here

198
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,630
which is cool once you get like out here
 

199
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,330
which is cool once you get like out here
though it goes quiet like when we

200
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,340
though it goes quiet like when we
 

201
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,909
though it goes quiet like when we
transition from the rooms so that worked

202
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:34,919
transition from the rooms so that worked
 

203
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,710
transition from the rooms so that worked
out pretty good I would say yeah it just

204
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
out pretty good I would say yeah it just
 

205
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,740
out pretty good I would say yeah it just
start over here listen to this part

206
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:42,750
start over here listen to this part
 

207
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,830
start over here listen to this part
that's coming up I'll tell you when

208
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840

 

209
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,439

right here you see it went like

210
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:51,449
right here you see it went like
 

211
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,040
right here you see it went like
high-pitched and then it drops an octave

212
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,050
high-pitched and then it drops an octave
 

213
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,540
high-pitched and then it drops an octave
that's a problem I don't really know how

214
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:56,550
that's a problem I don't really know how
 

215
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,089
that's a problem I don't really know how
to deal with

216
00:04:59,089 --> 00:04:59,099
to deal with
 

217
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,600
to deal with
let's let's let this finish you see the

218
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:03,610
let's let's let this finish you see the
 

219
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,279
let's let's let this finish you see the
redstone turns on here and then I move a

220
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,289
redstone turns on here and then I move a
 

221
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,860
redstone turns on here and then I move a
piston out of the way to stop it this

222
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:07,870
piston out of the way to stop it this
 

223
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,900

isn't the mechanism for starting

224
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:09,910
isn't the mechanism for starting
 

225
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,100
isn't the mechanism for starting

the observers up over there uh-huh but

228
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:14,349
the observers up over there uh-huh but
 

229
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,650

octaves like that's the range of pitches

238
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
octaves like that's the range of pitches
 

239
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,180

just twenty-four different notes we need

240
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,190
just twenty-four different notes we need

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:40,630
music that's kind of what I'm hoping
 

247
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,270
music that's kind of what I'm hoping
they might change it to eventually now

248
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,280
they might change it to eventually now
 

249
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,420

that there's options for more blocks in

250
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,430
that there's options for more blocks in
 

251
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,029
that there's options for more blocks in
Minecraft maybe more data kind of hoping

252
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:48,039
Minecraft maybe more data kind of hoping
 

253
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,980
Minecraft maybe more data kind of hoping
they'd redo note blocks and give them a

254
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:49,990
they'd redo note blocks and give them a
 

255
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,230
they'd redo note blocks and give them a
better interface and stuff so that we

256
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
better interface and stuff so that we
 

257
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,870
better interface and stuff so that we
can have more range more instruments and

258
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
can have more range more instruments and
 

259

like you see the note here then the

264
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:02,199
like you see the note here then the
 

265
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,839

some texture packs do I'm kind of hoping

272
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:12,820
some texture packs do I'm kind of hoping
 

273
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,719
some texture packs do I'm kind of hoping
they change that because it's really

274
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:15,729
they change that because it's really
 

275
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,820
they change that because it's really
hard to actually encode a song in

want to see it working right so we've

300
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,020
want to see it working right so we've
 

301
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,450
want to see it working right so we've
built a lot of the components to our

302
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,460
built a lot of the components to our
 

303
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,010
built a lot of the components to our
mastermind game here now we're kind of

304
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,020
mastermind game here now we're kind of
 

305
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,930
mastermind game here now we're kind of
at the point where we got most of the

306
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:54,940
at the point where we got most of the
 

307
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,370
at the point where we got most of the
important stuff built but we got to

308
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:56,380
important stuff built but we got to
 

309
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,129
important stuff built but we got to
start linking it together to finalize it

310
00:06:59,129 --> 00:06:59,139
start linking it together to finalize it
 

311
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,839
start linking it together to finalize it
to actually get all the pieces working

312
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:00,849
to actually get all the pieces working
 

313
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,270
to actually get all the pieces working
together like a big puzzle that's

314
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280

makes sense okay anyways so one thing

318
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:08,860
makes sense okay anyways so one thing
 

319
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,529
makes sense okay anyways so one thing
I've done now is that added these water

320
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:10,539
I've done now is that added these water
 

321
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,700
I've done now is that added these water
streams

322
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:11,710
streams
 

323
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,920
streams
on both sides here these connect the

324
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:13,930
on both sides here these connect the
 

325
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,219
on both sides here these connect the
code randomizer to the part of the of

326
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:17,229
code randomizer to the part of the of
 

327
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,550
code randomizer to the part of the of
the game here that handles the logic so

328
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
the game here that handles the logic so
 

329
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,159
the game here that handles the logic so
you know that ice stream thing so

330
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:23,169
you know that ice stream thing so
 

331
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,430
you know that ice stream thing so
basically let's just show that we got

332
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:26,440
basically let's just show that we got
 

333
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,120
basically let's just show that we got
our random code thing here purple blue

334
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,130
our random code thing here purple blue
 

335
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,740
our random code thing here purple blue
orange red right we hit this button it

336
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:31,750
orange red right we hit this button it
 

337
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,480
orange red right we hit this button it
randomizes the new code so we'll do that

338
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,490
randomizes the new code so we'll do that
 

339
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,890
randomizes the new code so we'll do that
at the start of the game it'll make a

340
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:34,900
at the start of the game it'll make a
 

341
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,560
at the start of the game it'll make a
random code that we can't see that we

342
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,570
random code that we can't see that we
 

343
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,560
random code that we can't see that we
have to guess inside here I put some

344
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,570
have to guess inside here I put some
 

345
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,469
have to guess inside here I put some
concrete powder now and basically when

346
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:43,479
concrete powder now and basically when
 

347
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,680
concrete powder now and basically when
we press this button over here at the

348
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:46,690
we press this button over here at the
 

349
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,029
we press this button over here at the
start of the game this is gonna happen

350
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:48,039
start of the game this is gonna happen
 

351
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,089
start of the game this is gonna happen
as well we eject some concrete powder

352
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:54,099
as well we eject some concrete powder
 

353
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,620
as well we eject some concrete powder
out of those shell core boxes and they

354
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,630
out of those shell core boxes and they
 

355
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,240
out of those shell core boxes and they
go into the water streams on both sides

356
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,250
go into the water streams on both sides
 

357
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,600
go into the water streams on both sides
here and then they end up at the ice

358
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,610
here and then they end up at the ice
 

359
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,320
here and then they end up at the ice
stream below up over here so this is our

360
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,330
stream below up over here so this is our
 

361
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,990
stream below up over here so this is our
code green green yellow orange I just

362
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,000
code green green yellow orange I just
 

363
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,749
code green green yellow orange I just
wondered did I mirror that by accidents

364
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
wondered did I mirror that by accidents
 

365
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,620
wondered did I mirror that by accidents
so it was I gotta make sure

366
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,630
so it was I gotta make sure
 

367
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,560
so it was I gotta make sure
so it's green green yellow orange what

368
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,570
so it's green green yellow orange what
 

369
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,460
so it's green green yellow orange what
does that thing say here green green

370
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,470
does that thing say here green green
 

371
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,420
does that thing say here green green
orange yellow oh so I got the yellow and

372
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,430
orange yellow oh so I got the yellow and
 

373
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,779
orange yellow oh so I got the yellow and
orange mixed up how did I do that the

374
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:27,789
orange mixed up how did I do that the
 

375
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,279
orange mixed up how did I do that the
green and the green might be mixed up to

376
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,289
green and the green might be mixed up to
 

377
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,779
green and the green might be mixed up to
you then because they're both the same I

378
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:30,789
you then because they're both the same I
 

379
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,510
you then because they're both the same I
can't tell ya I'll have to fix that

380
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:33,520
can't tell ya I'll have to fix that
 

381
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,920
can't tell ya I'll have to fix that
because they should line up with each

382
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:34,930
because they should line up with each
 

383
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,240
because they should line up with each
other according to what we see on the

384
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,250
other according to what we see on the
 

385
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,969
other according to what we see on the
code there but that'll get them down

386
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:38,979
code there but that'll get them down
 

387
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,579
code there but that'll get them down
there right so that's all good I had to

388
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:41,589
there right so that's all good I had to
 

389
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,320
there right so that's all good I had to
do something here with upside down

390
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,330
do something here with upside down
 

391
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,769
do something here with upside down
stairs we're using these to align the

392
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:46,779
stairs we're using these to align the
 

393
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,460
stairs we're using these to align the
blocks because I realized something I

394
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,470
blocks because I realized something I
 

395
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,730
blocks because I realized something I
had like an item on one side of the

396
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:52,740
had like an item on one side of the
 

397
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,960
had like an item on one side of the
block here and I was realizing when I

398
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:54,970
block here and I was realizing when I
 

399
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,140
block here and I was realizing when I
was sending another item down the other

400
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,150
was sending another item down the other
 

401
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,880
was sending another item down the other
side they don't actually join together

402
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,890
side they don't actually join together
 

403
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,030
side they don't actually join together
they don't stack which is what we use in

404
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
they don't stack which is what we use in
 

405
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,519
they don't stack which is what we use in
our logic part of the game so in order

406
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:05,529
our logic part of the game so in order
 

407
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,530
our logic part of the game so in order
to make sure the item ends up like in

408
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:07,540
to make sure the item ends up like in
 

409
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,400
to make sure the item ends up like in
the middle we use some some stairs here

410
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,410
the middle we use some some stairs here
 

411
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,470
the middle we use some some stairs here
so when it's going this way the stair

412
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,480
so when it's going this way the stair
 

413
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,380
so when it's going this way the stair
stops it like instead of going all the

414
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,390
stops it like instead of going all the
 

415
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,180
stops it like instead of going all the
way to over here it stops it like that

416
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,190
way to over here it stops it like that
 

417
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,180
way to over here it stops it like that
over here and then again this way it

418
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,190
over here and then again this way it
 

419
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,329
over here and then again this way it
stops it this way so instead of going

420
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:24,339
stops it this way so instead of going
 

421
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,560
stops it this way so instead of going
all the way over to here

422
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,570
all the way over to here
 

423
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,910
all the way over to here
all the way over to here so it ends up

424
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:26,920
all the way over to here so it ends up
 

425
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,440
all the way over to here so it ends up
like right in the middle of this block

426
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,450
like right in the middle of this block
 

427
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,630
like right in the middle of this block
when it falls down and it falls straight

428
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
when it falls down and it falls straight
 

429
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,430
when it falls down and it falls straight
down it doesn't slide on the ice so

430
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
down it doesn't slide on the ice so
 

431
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,810
down it doesn't slide on the ice so
that's that's the way we're doing that

432
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:33,820
that's that's the way we're doing that
 

433
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,140
that's that's the way we're doing that
um you know I might just do this lazy

434
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,150
um you know I might just do this lazy
 

435
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,540
um you know I might just do this lazy
way I don't want to redo the whole

436
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:39,550
way I don't want to redo the whole
 

437
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,300
way I don't want to redo the whole
stream so we'll do it like this we'll

438
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,310
stream so we'll do it like this we'll
 

439
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,270
stream so we'll do it like this we'll
just instead of this stream going up and

440
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,280
just instead of this stream going up and
 

441
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,400
just instead of this stream going up and
around this way we'll make it go through

442
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,410
around this way we'll make it go through
 

443
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,100
around this way we'll make it go through
here and connect over here and then this

444
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,110
here and connect over here and then this
 

445
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,840
here and connect over here and then this
one we will run a nice stream across

446
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:53,850
one we will run a nice stream across
 

447
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,940
one we will run a nice stream across
this way and down okay

448
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:58,950
this way and down okay
 

449
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,380
this way and down okay
okay that'll work so every one of these

450
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,390
okay that'll work so every one of these
 

451
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,450
okay that'll work so every one of these
it's different color so we got green

452
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:03,460
it's different color so we got green
 

453
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,380
it's different color so we got green
orange red blue green orange red blue

454
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,390
orange red blue green orange red blue
 

455
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,180
orange red blue green orange red blue
okay so let's send this down I think I

456
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,190
okay so let's send this down I think I
 

457
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,580
okay so let's send this down I think I
got it switched now properly but I

458
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,590
got it switched now properly but I
 

459
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,660
got it switched now properly but I
realize there's one more thing that

460
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:15,670
realize there's one more thing that
 

461
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,900
realize there's one more thing that
needs to line up okay so we got red

462
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:18,910
needs to line up okay so we got red
 

463
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,190
needs to line up okay so we got red
going down there I'm blue going down

464
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,200
going down there I'm blue going down
 

465
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,080
going down there I'm blue going down
there so it's blue red orange green if

466
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,090
there so it's blue red orange green if
 

467
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,890
there so it's blue red orange green if
we look down here we got blue red orange

468
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:31,900
we look down here we got blue red orange
 

469
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,560
we look down here we got blue red orange
green so that's the right order but we

470
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,570
green so that's the right order but we
 

471
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,290
green so that's the right order but we
also got to make sure so our switcheroo

472
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:37,300
also got to make sure so our switcheroo
 

473
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,960
also got to make sure so our switcheroo
was good there good stuff good stuff so

474
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:39,970
was good there good stuff good stuff so
 

475
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,550
was good there good stuff good stuff so
we also got to make sure our input lines

476
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:41,560
we also got to make sure our input lines
 

477
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,760
we also got to make sure our input lines
up too so if we enter blue red orange

478
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:47,770
up too so if we enter blue red orange
 

479
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,690
up too so if we enter blue red orange
green it needs to line up with the

480
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:51,700
green it needs to line up with the
 

481
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,670
green it needs to line up with the
answer there but also the input down

482
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
answer there but also the input down
 

483
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,450
answer there but also the input down
below there or our logic right so oh

484
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:57,460
below there or our logic right so oh
 

485
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,930
below there or our logic right so oh
yeah I got a jump here we jump that'll

486
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:00,940
yeah I got a jump here we jump that'll
 

487
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,840
yeah I got a jump here we jump that'll
break it and send it down so now ideally

488
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:03,850
break it and send it down so now ideally
 

489
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,470
break it and send it down so now ideally
we should see them stacked together yeah

490
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,480
we should see them stacked together yeah
 

491
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,360
we should see them stacked together yeah
we got two blue to red to orange and two

492
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,370
we got two blue to red to orange and two
 

493
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,800
we got two blue to red to orange and two
green so everything stacked together

494
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:13,810
green so everything stacked together
 

495
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,650
green so everything stacked together
like it was supposed to yeah so that

496
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:16,660
like it was supposed to yeah so that
 

497
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,850
like it was supposed to yeah so that
should be good they're all lining up

498
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:17,860
should be good they're all lining up
 

499
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,310
should be good they're all lining up
like they're supposed to now there is

500
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
like they're supposed to now there is
 

501
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,170
like they're supposed to now there is
something else we got to add to this

502
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,180
something else we got to add to this
 

503
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,780
something else we got to add to this
though like those items if we leave them

504
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:24,790
though like those items if we leave them
 

505
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,610
though like those items if we leave them
for five minutes they're gonna despawn

506
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:26,620
for five minutes they're gonna despawn
 

507
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,120
for five minutes they're gonna despawn
right so what we got to do is refresh it

508
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,130
right so what we got to do is refresh it
 

509
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,000
right so what we got to do is refresh it
and that's why we built it this way so

510
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,010
and that's why we built it this way so
 

511
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,610
and that's why we built it this way so
every time we press this we can refresh

512
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:35,620
every time we press this we can refresh
 

513
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,730
every time we press this we can refresh
it right well not quite we got to add

514
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:38,740
it right well not quite we got to add
 

515
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,300
it right well not quite we got to add
one more

516
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,310
one more
 

517
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,710
one more
mechanism because these are gonna stack

518
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
mechanism because these are gonna stack
 

519
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,570
mechanism because these are gonna stack
together with what we have down there

520
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:42,580
together with what we have down there
 

521
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,630
together with what we have down there
already the problem is like they'll keep

522
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
already the problem is like they'll keep
 

523
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,090
already the problem is like they'll keep
ending up in the same spot problem is

524
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,100
ending up in the same spot problem is
 

525
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,830
ending up in the same spot problem is
though if we have an item here and let's

526
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:52,840
though if we have an item here and let's
 

527
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,390
though if we have an item here and let's
say it's on the ground for 4 minutes and

528
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,400
say it's on the ground for 4 minutes and
 

529
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,329
say it's on the ground for 4 minutes and
50 seconds items de-spawn in 5 minutes

530
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:57,339
50 seconds items de-spawn in 5 minutes
 

531
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,750
50 seconds items de-spawn in 5 minutes
in 10 seconds it's gonna despawn if we

532
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:00,760
in 10 seconds it's gonna despawn if we
 

533
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,120
in 10 seconds it's gonna despawn if we
add another orange to this it doesn't

534
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,130
add another orange to this it doesn't
 

535
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,860
add another orange to this it doesn't
reset it to 5 minutes it's still gonna

536
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:04,870
reset it to 5 minutes it's still gonna
 

537
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,560
reset it to 5 minutes it's still gonna
despawn in 10 seconds so just by adding

538
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,570
despawn in 10 seconds so just by adding
 

539
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,040
despawn in 10 seconds so just by adding
more items to the stack here isn't

540
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,050
more items to the stack here isn't
 

541
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,230
more items to the stack here isn't
refreshing the code we actually have to

542
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
refreshing the code we actually have to
 

543
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,260
refreshing the code we actually have to
like remove these and then put new ones

544
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,270
like remove these and then put new ones
 

545
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,500
like remove these and then put new ones
there okay so I just added a mechanism

546
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:19,510
there okay so I just added a mechanism
 

547
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,450
there okay so I just added a mechanism
for this to remove these so that we can

548
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:21,460
for this to remove these so that we can
 

549
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,670
for this to remove these so that we can
drop new ones down and have the timer

550
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
drop new ones down and have the timer
 

551
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,310
drop new ones down and have the timer
reset so I was gonna do something with

552
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
reset so I was gonna do something with
 

553
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,870
reset so I was gonna do something with
pistons and I realized oh yeah just a

554
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
pistons and I realized oh yeah just a
 

555
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
pistons and I realized oh yeah just a
hopper minecart can pull items through

556
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:29,890
hopper minecart can pull items through
 

557
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,530
hopper minecart can pull items through
blocks that's probably the easiest thing

558
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:31,540
blocks that's probably the easiest thing
 

559
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,350
blocks that's probably the easiest thing
to do so if we make your round cross

560
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,360
to do so if we make your round cross
 

561
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,090
to do so if we make your round cross
here it'll pick up all the items above

562
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,100
here it'll pick up all the items above
 

563
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,470
here it'll pick up all the items above
and now we can drop down the new ones

564
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
and now we can drop down the new ones
 

565
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,360
and now we can drop down the new ones
mm-hmm all right so we got we got some

566
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,370
mm-hmm all right so we got we got some
 

567
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,430
mm-hmm all right so we got we got some
more stuff done here there were a bunch

568
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,440
more stuff done here there were a bunch
 

569
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,020
more stuff done here there were a bunch
of wires like in the middle of this

570
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,030
of wires like in the middle of this
 

571
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,360
of wires like in the middle of this
platform and I've moved them over I had

572
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,370
platform and I've moved them over I had
 

573
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,940
platform and I've moved them over I had
to redo a bunch of the redstone but like

574
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:50,950
to redo a bunch of the redstone but like
 

575
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,130
to redo a bunch of the redstone but like
those wires are over there before we got

576
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,140
those wires are over there before we got
 

577
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,050
those wires are over there before we got
it moved over so now I was able to

578
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,060
it moved over so now I was able to
 

579
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,970
it moved over so now I was able to
extend this a bit more and it feels like

580
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:56,980
extend this a bit more and it feels like
 

581
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,410
extend this a bit more and it feels like
we actually have a nice polished

582
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:58,420
we actually have a nice polished
 

583
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,140
we actually have a nice polished
starting area without a bunch of wires

584
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,150
starting area without a bunch of wires
 

585
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,810
starting area without a bunch of wires
in our face you know so that's all good

586
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:02,820
in our face you know so that's all good
 

587
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,910
in our face you know so that's all good
I've added a mechanism on the side here

588
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
I've added a mechanism on the side here
 

589
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,800
I've added a mechanism on the side here
for our our white and black peg displays

590
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:09,810
for our our white and black peg displays
 

591
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,340
for our our white and black peg displays
so there's a dropper up there somewhere

592
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,350
so there's a dropper up there somewhere
 

593
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,770
so there's a dropper up there somewhere
storing a bunch of items yeah up over

594
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:16,780
storing a bunch of items yeah up over
 

595
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
storing a bunch of items yeah up over
there which funnel into those hoppers

596
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:18,790
there which funnel into those hoppers
 

597
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,250
there which funnel into those hoppers
and they all kind of funneled down to

598
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,260
and they all kind of funneled down to
 

599
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,620
and they all kind of funneled down to
about there but then we need some way of

600
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:22,630
about there but then we need some way of
 

601
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,720
about there but then we need some way of
getting the items back up to the top

602
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,730
getting the items back up to the top
 

603
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,300
getting the items back up to the top
there to make it a complete cycle and I

604
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,310
there to make it a complete cycle and I
 

605
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,949
there to make it a complete cycle and I
was gonna do it manually but I decided

606
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
was gonna do it manually but I decided
 

607
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,370
was gonna do it manually but I decided
to add an automatic system for it here

608
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,380
to add an automatic system for it here
 

609
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,930
to add an automatic system for it here
so basically what we're gonna do is have

610
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:36,940
so basically what we're gonna do is have
 

611
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,410
so basically what we're gonna do is have
a storage minecarts it gets held in

612
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:40,420
a storage minecarts it gets held in
 

613
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,540
a storage minecarts it gets held in
place there by this block that can be

614
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:42,550
place there by this block that can be
 

615
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,780
place there by this block that can be
retracted with a piston and basically I

616
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:47,790
retracted with a piston and basically I
 

617
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,850
retracted with a piston and basically I
think I fill this up yeah

618
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:50,860
think I fill this up yeah
 

619
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,380
think I fill this up yeah
oh it's gonna be hard to do it though

620
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,390
oh it's gonna be hard to do it though
 

621
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,980
oh it's gonna be hard to do it though
with my inventory so full yard some more

622
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:55,990
with my inventory so full yard some more
 

623
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,460
with my inventory so full yard some more
items so basically the items in this

624
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,470
items so basically the items in this
 

625
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,730
items so basically the items in this
hopper will funnel into the storage

626
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:02,740
hopper will funnel into the storage
 

627
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,180
hopper will funnel into the storage
minecarts yeah they're going in there

628
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,190
minecarts yeah they're going in there
 

629
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,880
minecarts yeah they're going in there
good and then when this storage minecart

630
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:08,890
good and then when this storage minecart
 

631
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,040
good and then when this storage minecart
gets filled up of stone or whatever junk

632
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,050
gets filled up of stone or whatever junk
 

633
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,520
gets filled up of stone or whatever junk
item we want to use then we send it off

634
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,530
item we want to use then we send it off
 

635
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,470
item we want to use then we send it off
to unload at the top there oh I'm

636
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
to unload at the top there oh I'm
 

637
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,780
to unload at the top there oh I'm
stuttering what's going on let's put the

638
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,790
stuttering what's going on let's put the
 

639
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,840
stuttering what's going on let's put the
rest of that in okay and it fully filled

640
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:27,850
rest of that in okay and it fully filled
 

641
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,110
rest of that in okay and it fully filled
up so this comparator turns on with a

642
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
up so this comparator turns on with a
 

643
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,800
up so this comparator turns on with a
power of 15 and this one since this

644
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:34,810
power of 15 and this one since this
 

645
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,890
power of 15 and this one since this
lever is on right it has a power of 15

646
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:37,900
lever is on right it has a power of 15
 

647
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,290
lever is on right it has a power of 15
and it since to subtract mode so 15

648
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,300
and it since to subtract mode so 15
 

649
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,290
and it since to subtract mode so 15
minus 15 from this one is zero which

650
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,300
minus 15 from this one is zero which
 

651
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,260
minus 15 from this one is zero which
causes the piston to retract and then it

652
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,270
causes the piston to retract and then it
 

653
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,270
causes the piston to retract and then it
goes up here and it starts unloading the

654
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:51,280
goes up here and it starts unloading the
 

655
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,450
goes up here and it starts unloading the
storage minecarts this turns on which

656
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:54,460
storage minecarts this turns on which
 

657
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,400
storage minecarts this turns on which
holds it in place a ton powers a power

658
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,410
holds it in place a ton powers a power
 

659
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,550
holds it in place a ton powers a power
rail over here and as long as there's

660
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,560
rail over here and as long as there's
 

661
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,080
rail over here and as long as there's
items flowing through this hopper it

662
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,090
items flowing through this hopper it
 

663
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,110
items flowing through this hopper it
stays there until this kind of all fills

664
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,120
stays there until this kind of all fills
 

665
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,070
stays there until this kind of all fills
up in this empties uh-huh all right so

666
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,080
up in this empties uh-huh all right so
 

667
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,020
up in this empties uh-huh all right so
some of this stuff is actually getting a

668
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,030
some of this stuff is actually getting a
 

669
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,230
some of this stuff is actually getting a
little bit tricky for me I'm gonna try

670
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,240
little bit tricky for me I'm gonna try
 

671
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,110
little bit tricky for me I'm gonna try
my best to explain the problems here so

672
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,120
my best to explain the problems here so
 

673
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,060
my best to explain the problems here so
I'm working on the logic part of this

674
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,070
I'm working on the logic part of this
 

675
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,190
I'm working on the logic part of this
right now like how many black pegs

676
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,200
right now like how many black pegs
 

677
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,960
right now like how many black pegs
should be awarded and how do how do we

678
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:21,970
should be awarded and how do how do we
 

679
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,840
should be awarded and how do how do we
do it

680
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:23,850
do it
 

681
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,520
do it
so let's say our guess here is blue it

682
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,530
so let's say our guess here is blue it
 

683
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,930
so let's say our guess here is blue it
lines up with that so we're supposed to

684
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:30,940
lines up with that so we're supposed to
 

685
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,750
lines up with that so we're supposed to
get a black peg awarded for that right

686
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:32,760
get a black peg awarded for that right
 

687
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,430
get a black peg awarded for that right
how do we actually detect that is a

688
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
how do we actually detect that is a
 

689
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
how do we actually detect that is a
problem I thought we could use the

690
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:36,850
problem I thought we could use the
 

691
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,370
problem I thought we could use the
pressure plate in the back here to do

692
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:38,380
pressure plate in the back here to do
 

693
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,370
pressure plate in the back here to do
that like if it goes over top but we're

694
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,380
that like if it goes over top but we're
 

695
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,200
that like if it goes over top but we're
awarding the black page if it's stacks

696
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,210
awarding the black page if it's stacks
 

697
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,530
awarding the black page if it's stacks
not if it gets to here like if it

698
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:46,540
not if it gets to here like if it
 

699
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,950
not if it gets to here like if it
doesn't stack it'll get to the pressure

700
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:49,960
doesn't stack it'll get to the pressure
 

701
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,380
doesn't stack it'll get to the pressure
plate so basically we're not detecting

702
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,390
plate so basically we're not detecting
 

703
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,550
plate so basically we're not detecting
if it hits the pressure plate we're

704
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,560
if it hits the pressure plate we're
 

705
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,260
if it hits the pressure plate we're
detecting if it doesn't hit the pressure

706
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,270
detecting if it doesn't hit the pressure
 

707
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,450
detecting if it doesn't hit the pressure
plates how do you do that it's a lot

708
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,460
plates how do you do that it's a lot
 

709
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,950
plates how do you do that it's a lot
harder because if it doesn't statue

710
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:01,960
harder because if it doesn't statue
 

711
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,929
harder because if it doesn't statue
don't hit the pressure plate right

712
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:03,939
don't hit the pressure plate right
 

713
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,929
don't hit the pressure plate right
that so I think what we gotta do is

714
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:06,939
that so I think what we gotta do is
 

715
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,059
that so I think what we gotta do is
maybe have another set of pressure

716
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:09,069
maybe have another set of pressure
 

717
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:15,689
maybe have another set of pressure
plates I think we need like another one

718
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:15,699
plates I think we need like another one
 

719
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,659
plates I think we need like another one
here and if this one gets activated but

720
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:18,669
here and if this one gets activated but
 

721
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,059
here and if this one gets activated but
this one doesn't then we award the black

722
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:21,069
this one doesn't then we award the black
 

723
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,129
this one doesn't then we award the black
peg I think is the idea that's what I'm

724
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:26,139
peg I think is the idea that's what I'm
 

725
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,109
peg I think is the idea that's what I'm
gonna try to do so I was gonna do

726
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:28,119
gonna try to do so I was gonna do
 

727
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,399
gonna try to do so I was gonna do
something with pistons here and I'm

728
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:29,409
something with pistons here and I'm
 

729
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,729
something with pistons here and I'm
realizing this is just nasty so I'm

730
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:32,739
realizing this is just nasty so I'm
 

731
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:39,809
realizing this is just nasty so I'm
gonna redo it let's see we don't have a

732
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:39,819
gonna redo it let's see we don't have a
 

733
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,460
gonna redo it let's see we don't have a
lot of space to work with either here's

734
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,470
lot of space to work with either here's
 

735
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,809
lot of space to work with either here's
the problem because I've added in this

736
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:42,819
the problem because I've added in this
 

737
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:47,159
the problem because I've added in this
rail here and it's gonna get in the way

738
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:47,169
rail here and it's gonna get in the way
 

739
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,539
rail here and it's gonna get in the way
I think I kind of have an idea of what

740
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:51,549
I think I kind of have an idea of what
 

741
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,249
I think I kind of have an idea of what
we need to do what we need to do though

742
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:53,259
we need to do what we need to do though
 

743
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,499
we need to do what we need to do though
so right above here is that pressure

744
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:55,509
so right above here is that pressure
 

745
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,979
so right above here is that pressure
plate we just put down I think we need

746
00:16:58,979 --> 00:16:58,989
plate we just put down I think we need
 

747
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,539
plate we just put down I think we need
like a redstone torch this doesn't

748
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:03,549
like a redstone torch this doesn't
 

749
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:08,009
like a redstone torch this doesn't
matter and we got to like run it under

750
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:08,019
matter and we got to like run it under
 

751
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,850
matter and we got to like run it under
the rail now because it's in the way

752
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:10,860
the rail now because it's in the way
 

753
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,740
the rail now because it's in the way
so you're on it under here and we'll

754
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:16,750
so you're on it under here and we'll
 

755
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,149
so you're on it under here and we'll
need some kind of delay because we got

756
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:18,159
need some kind of delay because we got
 

757
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,590
need some kind of delay because we got
to wait for it to hit the other pressure

758
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
to wait for it to hit the other pressure
 

759
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,110
to wait for it to hit the other pressure
plates let's just put that there and yet

760
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
plates let's just put that there and yet
 

761
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,070
plates let's just put that there and yet
another one of these and somehow run it

762
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,080
another one of these and somehow run it
 

763
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,220
another one of these and somehow run it
up to here I guess we could use a slab

764
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,230
up to here I guess we could use a slab
 

765
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,610
up to here I guess we could use a slab
and then change this to a slab I

766
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:37,620
and then change this to a slab I
 

767
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,169
and then change this to a slab I
sometimes use notebooks for testing like

768
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:40,179
sometimes use notebooks for testing like
 

769
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,700
sometimes use notebooks for testing like
if I can't see what's happening I have

770
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,710
if I can't see what's happening I have
 

771
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,629
if I can't see what's happening I have
to go by sound so I think we're gonna

772
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:45,639
to go by sound so I think we're gonna
 

773
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,249
to go by sound so I think we're gonna
have to have a redstone torch here we

774
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:47,259
have to have a redstone torch here we
 

775
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:49,320
have to have a redstone torch here we
kind of we're making like a NAND gate I

776
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,330
kind of we're making like a NAND gate I
 

777
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,580
kind of we're making like a NAND gate I
guess ok so we run the signal up here so

778
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:56,590
guess ok so we run the signal up here so
 

779
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,440
guess ok so we run the signal up here so
if this redstone torch turns on that

780
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,450
if this redstone torch turns on that
 

781
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,879
if this redstone torch turns on that
means we award a black peg I think let's

782
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:02,889
means we award a black peg I think let's
 

783
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:08,039
means we award a black peg I think let's
try this out I'm stuck down here

784
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:08,049

 

785
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,750

oh okay so let's test this before those

786
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:12,760
oh okay so let's test this before those
 

787
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,240
oh okay so let's test this before those
despawn if we can so we're gonna throw a

788
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,250
despawn if we can so we're gonna throw a
 

789
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,600
despawn if we can so we're gonna throw a
blue in here which should line up right

790
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,610

 

791
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,269

and quickly quickly before they do spawn

792
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:24,279
and quickly quickly before they do spawn
 

793
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,500
and quickly quickly before they do spawn
so let's see if that happens oh we heard

794
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,510
so let's see if that happens oh we heard
 

795
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,230
so let's see if that happens oh we heard
the note okay that's good okay so this

796
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,240
the note okay that's good okay so this
 

797
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,610
the note okay that's good okay so this
time we're gonna do it again but we're

798
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:32,620
time we're gonna do it again but we're
 

799
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,659
time we're gonna do it again but we're
not using blue we're gonna use a

800
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:33,669
not using blue we're gonna use a
 

801
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:39,690
not using blue we're gonna use a
different color so it won't stack and no

802
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:39,700
different color so it won't stack and no
 

803
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,669
different color so it won't stack and no
no block plate okay so that's good cuz

804
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
no block plate okay so that's good cuz
 

805
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,930
no block plate okay so that's good cuz
we're not supposed to get a black peg if

806
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:42,940
we're not supposed to get a black peg if
 

807
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,299
we're not supposed to get a black peg if
they don't stack so that does exactly

808
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:45,309
they don't stack so that does exactly
 

809
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,090
they don't stack so that does exactly
what we want

810
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,100
what we want
 

811
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,330
what we want
basically yeah if this gets powered

812
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,340
basically yeah if this gets powered
 

813
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,919
basically yeah if this gets powered
again from that second pressure plate it

814
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:52,929
again from that second pressure plate it
 

815
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:58,850
again from that second pressure plate it
prevents this torch from switching

816
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:58,860

 

817
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,049

alright I might be losing my voice a

818
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:01,059
alright I might be losing my voice a
 

819
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,789
alright I might be losing my voice a
little bit now fast forward a couple

820
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
little bit now fast forward a couple
 

821
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,190
little bit now fast forward a couple
hours in time here I've been working on

822
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
hours in time here I've been working on
 

823
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,990
hours in time here I've been working on
it non-stop red stone projects you know

824
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
it non-stop red stone projects you know
 

825
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,639
it non-stop red stone projects you know
they they tend to drag on a little bit

826
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:11,649
they they tend to drag on a little bit
 

827
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,259
they they tend to drag on a little bit
they make it a little bit tricky that

828
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:13,269
they make it a little bit tricky that
 

829
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,930
they make it a little bit tricky that
when you're trying to finish them but

830
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:15,940
when you're trying to finish them but
 

831
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,039
when you're trying to finish them but
here's what I've been working on now

832
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,049
here's what I've been working on now
 

833
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,529
here's what I've been working on now
basically I'll show you how I've been

834
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:19,539
basically I'll show you how I've been
 

835
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,649
basically I'll show you how I've been
testing this it's actually pretty pretty

836
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:21,659
testing this it's actually pretty pretty
 

837
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,000
testing this it's actually pretty pretty
annoying but basically I've been

838
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,010
annoying but basically I've been
 

839
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,799
annoying but basically I've been
matching the color code here alright and

840
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:25,809
matching the color code here alright and
 

841
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,519
matching the color code here alright and
then I activate this and run down here

842
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:29,529
then I activate this and run down here
 

843
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,340
then I activate this and run down here
as quickly as I can and make sure this

844
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,350
as quickly as I can and make sure this
 

845
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,330
as quickly as I can and make sure this
wire pulse is 4 times because all four

846
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:36,340
wire pulse is 4 times because all four
 

847
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,889
wire pulse is 4 times because all four
of those lined up so we should get four

848
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:37,899
of those lined up so we should get four
 

849
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,659
of those lined up so we should get four
black pegs and this wire runs over to

850
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:42,669
black pegs and this wire runs over to
 

851
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,330
black pegs and this wire runs over to
here so we got the black peg logic

852
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,340
here so we got the black peg logic
 

853
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,710
here so we got the black peg logic
figured out now I think it's I think

854
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
figured out now I think it's I think
 

855
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,889
figured out now I think it's I think
it's all good this goes up to the

856
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:49,899
it's all good this goes up to the
 

857
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,279
it's all good this goes up to the
dropper which shoots those garbage items

858
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:53,289
dropper which shoots those garbage items
 

859
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:59,519
dropper which shoots those garbage items
into our display yeah I think that's

860
00:19:59,519 --> 00:19:59,529
into our display yeah I think that's
 

861
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,190
into our display yeah I think that's
good let's try this again

862
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,200
good let's try this again
 

863
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,100
good let's try this again
let's let's watch this actually ok blue

864
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,110
let's let's watch this actually ok blue
 

865
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,160
let's let's watch this actually ok blue
purple orange

866
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,170
purple orange
 

867
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,420
purple orange
man I'm really tired I said this was

868
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,430
man I'm really tired I said this was
 

869
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,340
man I'm really tired I said this was
blue din and I okay let's watch the

870
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,350
blue din and I okay let's watch the
 

871
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,390
blue din and I okay let's watch the
display so this should all move forward

872
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:19,400
display so this should all move forward
 

873
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:28,120
display so this should all move forward
by one - I think yeah and it added four

874
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,130
by one - I think yeah and it added four
 

875
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,160
by one - I think yeah and it added four
again because we match for like we like

876
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,170
again because we match for like we like
 

877
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,410
again because we match for like we like
we're supposed to there what happens if

878
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:32,420
we're supposed to there what happens if
 

879
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,290
we're supposed to there what happens if
we just like match - so only green and

880
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,300
we just like match - so only green and
 

881
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,620
we just like match - so only green and
purple are gonna match up yeah testing

882
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:44,630
purple are gonna match up yeah testing
 

883
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,880
purple are gonna match up yeah testing
stuff takes a long time because you

884
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:45,890
stuff takes a long time because you
 

885
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,350
stuff takes a long time because you
gotta make sure everything works so why

886
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
gotta make sure everything works so why
 

887
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,980
gotta make sure everything works so why
did we get 300 that wasn't supposed to

888
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:53,990
did we get 300 that wasn't supposed to
 

889
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,450
did we get 300 that wasn't supposed to
happen okay wait a minute wait a minute

890
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:57,460
happen okay wait a minute wait a minute
 

891
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,360
happen okay wait a minute wait a minute
make sure it wasn't a fluke

892
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,370
make sure it wasn't a fluke
 

893
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:11,549
make sure it wasn't a fluke
so again we should only get one one two

894
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:11,559
so again we should only get one one two
 

895
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:17,789
so again we should only get one one two
three four one two don't oh wait a

896
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:17,799
three four one two don't oh wait a
 

897
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,560
three four one two don't oh wait a
minute wait a minute

898
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,570
minute wait a minute
 

899
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,159
minute wait a minute
so this is what determines when to move

900
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:23,169
so this is what determines when to move
 

901
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:25,080
so this is what determines when to move
the display and I realized it's

902
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,090
the display and I realized it's
 

903
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,620
the display and I realized it's
activating before the items flow into

904
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:28,630
activating before the items flow into
 

905
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,200
activating before the items flow into
the display aha

906
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,210
the display aha
 

907
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,639
the display aha
so let's try this one more time and buy

908
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:35,649
so let's try this one more time and buy
 

909
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:37,320
so let's try this one more time and buy
one more time I mean for the hundredth

910
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,330
one more time I mean for the hundredth
 

911
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:49,350
one more time I mean for the hundredth
time okay one two three four and that

912
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
time okay one two three four and that
 

913
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,570
time okay one two three four and that
happened before this switched taste that

914
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:51,580
happened before this switched taste that
 

915
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,260
happened before this switched taste that
turns oh come on

916
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,270
turns oh come on
 

917
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,260
turns oh come on
oh snap okay I think I got to figure it

918
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,270
oh snap okay I think I got to figure it
 

919
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,590
oh snap okay I think I got to figure it
out kind of it's this has been driving

920
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
out kind of it's this has been driving
 

921
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,080
out kind of it's this has been driving
me crazy and it's a weird game mechanic

922
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,090
me crazy and it's a weird game mechanic
 

923
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,560
me crazy and it's a weird game mechanic
I have never seen so I'll try show it to

924
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:07,570
I have never seen so I'll try show it to
 

925
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,250
I have never seen so I'll try show it to
you here I got four green down so only

926
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:11,260
you here I got four green down so only
 

927
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,399
you here I got four green down so only
one of them should stack watch the green

928
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:14,409
one of them should stack watch the green
 

929
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:18,419
one of them should stack watch the green
watch a green in the back there it

930
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:18,429
watch a green in the back there it
 

931
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,860
watch a green in the back there it
didn't happen okay it's inconsistent as

932
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:22,870
didn't happen okay it's inconsistent as
 

933
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,840
didn't happen okay it's inconsistent as
well so that's that's making this even

934
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:24,850
well so that's that's making this even
 

935
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,200
well so that's that's making this even
more fun let's reset this we'll try it

936
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,210
more fun let's reset this we'll try it
 

937
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,370
more fun let's reset this we'll try it
one more time if we get lucky it'll

938
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,380
one more time if we get lucky it'll
 

939
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,169
one more time if we get lucky it'll
happen this time

940
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:33,179
happen this time
 

941
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,269
happen this time
okay so it resets get the items down

942
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:36,279
okay so it resets get the items down
 

943
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,370
okay so it resets get the items down
again

944
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,380
again
 

945
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,919
again
and we'll drop another four green man I

946
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:43,929
and we'll drop another four green man I
 

947
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,090
and we'll drop another four green man I
don't know what to do about this one two

948
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,100
don't know what to do about this one two
 

949

don't know what to do about this one two
three four

950
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:51,899

 

951
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,539

quickly quickly hey let's watch it again

952
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:54,549
quickly quickly hey let's watch it again
 

953
00:22:54,549 --> 00:23:01,259
quickly quickly hey let's watch it again
watch the green yeah you see that it

954
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:01,269
watch the green yeah you see that it
 

955
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:02,129
watch the green yeah you see that it
stole it

956
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:02,139
stole it
 

957
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:06,149
stole it
oh man that's what's been causing all

958
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
oh man that's what's been causing all
 

959
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,950
oh man that's what's been causing all
the confusion of course I'm up there so

960
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:07,960
the confusion of course I'm up there so
 

961
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,129
the confusion of course I'm up there so
I can't see it happening right mm-hmm

962
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:11,139
I can't see it happening right mm-hmm
 

963
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,799
I can't see it happening right mm-hmm
okay so I have a theory here correct me

964
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:13,809
okay so I have a theory here correct me
 

965
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:19,350
okay so I have a theory here correct me
if I'm wrong yes I think the rule is the

966
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
if I'm wrong yes I think the rule is the
 

967
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,080
if I'm wrong yes I think the rule is the
stack with more items absorbs the one

968
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,090
stack with more items absorbs the one
 

969
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,590
stack with more items absorbs the one
with less so if this has one and this

970
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
with less so if this has one and this
 

971
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,710
with less so if this has one and this
stack has two this stack will absorb the

972
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
stack has two this stack will absorb the
 

973
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,649
stack has two this stack will absorb the
one with one and since the one with two

974
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:31,659
one with one and since the one with two
 

975
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,539
one with one and since the one with two
has a momentum it's gonna keep moving

976
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:35,549
has a momentum it's gonna keep moving
 

977
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,730
has a momentum it's gonna keep moving
right yeah so that's kind of what we

978
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:38,740
right yeah so that's kind of what we
 

979
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,840
right yeah so that's kind of what we
expected now if this has two and this

980
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:42,850
expected now if this has two and this
 

981
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,340
expected now if this has two and this
has one it'll stay put because the

982
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:47,350
has one it'll stay put because the
 

983
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,700
has one it'll stay put because the
stationary one absorbs the moving one

984
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,710
stationary one absorbs the moving one
 

985
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,779
stationary one absorbs the moving one
okay so it's got three in there right

986
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:51,789
okay so it's got three in there right
 

987
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:56,310
okay so it's got three in there right
now if we go for four absorbs three so

988
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
now if we go for four absorbs three so
 

989
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,960
now if we go for four absorbs three so
the moving one should keep moving

990
00:23:59,960 --> 00:23:59,970

 

991
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,249

not quite sure what happens when they're

992
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:02,259
not quite sure what happens when they're
 

993
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:04,440
not quite sure what happens when they're
equal it seems to stay put most of the

994
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,450
equal it seems to stay put most of the
 

995
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:11,100
equal it seems to stay put most of the
