and similar to exactly the same as each

166
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
and similar to exactly the same as each
 

167
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,760
and similar to exactly the same as each
other as well so I think it's kind of a

168
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:34,770
other as well so I think it's kind of a
 

169
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,420
other as well so I think it's kind of a
common-sense thing but yeah this is kind

170
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,430
common-sense thing but yeah this is kind
 

171
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,129
common-sense thing but yeah this is kind

172
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:43,139
of challenging as I found out to make
 

173
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,730

one that doesn't Jam like the design I

174
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:46,740
one that doesn't Jam like the design I
 

175
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,980
one that doesn't Jam like the design I
made last episode was good like you

176
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:48,990
made last episode was good like you
 

177
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,230

would work if if the mobs were coming up

178
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
would work if if the mobs were coming up
 

179
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,219
would work if if the mobs were coming up
one at a time like most mob systems but

180
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:55,229
one at a time like most mob systems but
 

181
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,270
one at a time like most mob systems but
since this is super efficient now we

182
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
since this is super efficient now we
 

183
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,029
since this is super efficient now we
have to make it so it can handle mobs

184
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,039
have to make it so it can handle mobs
 

185
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,250
have to make it so it can handle mobs
clumping up and stuff like that anyway

186
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,260
clumping up and stuff like that anyway
 

187
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,520
clumping up and stuff like that anyway
I'm going to stop talking here because I

188
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,530

 

189
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,070

can barely build anything when I'm

190
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
can barely build anything when I'm
 

191
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,610
can barely build anything when I'm
talking nonstop

192
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:24,620

 

193
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,450

I can barely coherently put a sentence

194
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,460
I can barely coherently put a sentence
 

195
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,850
I can barely coherently put a sentence
together even when I'm completely

196
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:33,860
together even when I'm completely
 

197
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,240
together even when I'm completely
focused on talking oh I'm having trouble

198
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,250
focused on talking oh I'm having trouble
 

199
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,990

with the water patterns here not doing

200
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
with the water patterns here not doing
 

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,230
with the water patterns here not doing
what I want them to do we're going to

202
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
what I want them to do we're going to
 

203
00:06:50,240 --> 00:07:02,250
what I want them to do we're going to
kill that side there we go that worked

204
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,260
kill that side there we go that worked
 

205
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:14,920
kill that side there we go that worked
um so I think I know a way to make it

206
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:14,930
um so I think I know a way to make it
 

207
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:22,150
um so I think I know a way to make it
better no my class that was only two

208
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
better no my class that was only two
 

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,610
better no my class that was only two
that's fine the old one I made last

210
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:27,620
that's fine the old one I made last
 

211
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,420
that's fine the old one I made last
episode I had put like three blocks and

212
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,430
episode I had put like three blocks and
 

213
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,750
episode I had put like three blocks and
the mobs could only swim up one of them

214
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:33,760
the mobs could only swim up one of them
 

215
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,430
the mobs could only swim up one of them
the tall mobs I think ideally you only

216
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
the tall mobs I think ideally you only
 

217
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,880
the tall mobs I think ideally you only
need one block to block the spiders I

218
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:47,890

 

219
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,860

think ideally

220
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:51,870

 

221
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,440

we should only use one block to do that

222
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,450
we should only use one block to do that
 

223
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:06,800
we should only use one block to do that
then and place signs I think I got more

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:06,810
then and place signs I think I got more
 

225
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:16,700
then and place signs I think I got more
signs in here yeah all right place three

226
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:16,710
signs in here yeah all right place three
 

227
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,270
signs in here yeah all right place three
signs spiders can swim up because of

228
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,280
signs spiders can swim up because of
 

229
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,450
signs spiders can swim up because of
that block and yet there's three holes

230
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,460
that block and yet there's three holes
 

231
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,950
that block and yet there's three holes
for the tall mobs to squeeze through if

232
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
for the tall mobs to squeeze through if
 

233
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,420
for the tall mobs to squeeze through if
they're bouncing around I think they

234
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,430
they're bouncing around I think they
 

235
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,640
they're bouncing around I think they
should manage to bounce their way free I

236
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:33,650
should manage to bounce their way free I
 

237
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:47,060
should manage to bounce their way free I
hope J and then we're going to make a

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,070
hope J and then we're going to make a
 

239
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:53,110
hope J and then we're going to make a
water B and more leg

240
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
water B and more leg

consumers in general don't want to buy a
computer like this and so they kept

326
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:10,759
computer like this and so they kept
 

327
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,749
computer like this and so they kept
lowering it lowering it I bought it six

328
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:13,759
lowering it lowering it I bought it six
 

329
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,220
lowering it lowering it I bought it six

23 inch LED monitor and they had one
 

335
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,559
23 inch LED monitor and they had one
left when I went in 6 months ago

336
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:31,569
left when I went in 6 months ago
 

337
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:35,650

341
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:45,009
could give me on it and he said 1750
with the monitor after about 30 minutes

342
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:45,019
with the monitor after about 30 minutes
 

343
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,900
with the monitor after about 30 minutes

347
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,980
managed to get him down to $1400 with
the monitor and a 3-year warranty for

348
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:53,990
the monitor and a 3-year warranty for
 

349

free so I was pretty happy about that

350
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220
free so I was pretty happy about that
 

351
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,129
free so I was pretty happy about that
this computer is custom over here in

352
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:01,139
this computer is custom over here in
 

353
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,879
this computer is custom over here in
Canada - and it was six months ago I

354
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:03,889
Canada - and it was six months ago I
 

355
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:09,920
Canada - and it was six months ago I
think is a pretty good deal but yeah

356
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:09,930
think is a pretty good deal but yeah
 

357
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,590
think is a pretty good deal but yeah
this works there are only getting fan

358
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
this works there are only getting fan
 

359
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,579
this works there are only getting fan
because the tall knobs are stuck in this

360
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:18,589
because the tall knobs are stuck in this
 

361
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,189
because the tall knobs are stuck in this
spot here but they'll be moving out of

362
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:22,199
spot here but they'll be moving out of
 

363
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:27,530
spot here but they'll be moving out of
that spot so it's not an issue seems to

364
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,540
that spot so it's not an issue seems to
 

365
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,720
that spot so it's not an issue seems to
work good um so we're going to route the

366
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:32,730
work good um so we're going to route the
 

367
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,449
work good um so we're going to route the
spiders to a killing chamber here and

368
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:37,459
spiders to a killing chamber here and
 

369
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,900
spiders to a killing chamber here and
then the string will get to routed to

370
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:41,910
then the string will get to routed to
 

371
00:13:41,910 --> 00:14:00,980
then the string will get to routed to
our minecart gate here somehow and what

372
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:00,990
our minecart gate here somehow and what
 

373
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,870
our minecart gate here somehow and what
I'm gonna have is like a door

374
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm gonna have is like a door
 

375
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm gonna have is like a door
this is like the simplest item Junction

376
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:09,650
this is like the simplest item Junction
 

377
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,560
this is like the simplest item Junction
you can make you can place a door and

378
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,570
you can make you can place a door and
 

379
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:22,840
you can make you can place a door and
say there is a water stream above sure

380
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:22,850
say there is a water stream above sure
 

381
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:33,310
say there is a water stream above sure
let's build a crude example here if you

382
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,320
let's build a crude example here if you
 

383
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,030
let's build a crude example here if you
can get I should do this a little better

384
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040

 

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,950

[Music]

386
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:45,960

 

387
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,110

[Music]

388
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
[Music]
 

389
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,630
[Music]
let's try this yeah so what if you have

390
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,640
let's try this yeah so what if you have
 

391
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,740
let's try this yeah so what if you have
a water stream going over a door you can

392
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:56,750
a water stream going over a door you can
 

393
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,370
a water stream going over a door you can
make it so that items will pass over top

394
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:00,380
make it so that items will pass over top
 

395
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,740
make it so that items will pass over top
the door if there are lines to the right

396
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:02,750
the door if there are lines to the right
 

397
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,370
the door if there are lines to the right
side like the doors on the sides of the

398
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,380
side like the doors on the sides of the
 

399
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,400
side like the doors on the sides of the
items right against that side I'll go

400
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,410
items right against that side I'll go
 

401
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,020
items right against that side I'll go
over top the door but if you open the

402
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,030
over top the door but if you open the
 

403
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,310
over top the door but if you open the
door they'll fall and so I'm going to

404
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,320
door they'll fall and so I'm going to
 

405
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,050
door they'll fall and so I'm going to
use that simple method of choosing

406
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,060
use that simple method of choosing
 

407
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,990
use that simple method of choosing
whether string gets sent to the main

408
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,000
whether string gets sent to the main
 

409
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,260
whether string gets sent to the main
collection point down below and I'll be

410
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,270
collection point down below and I'll be
 

411
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,010
collection point down below and I'll be
doing that with with string this film

412
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,020
doing that with with string this film
 

413
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,090
doing that with with string this film
with bacon and leather and feathers and

414
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,100
with bacon and leather and feathers and
 

415
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,600
with bacon and leather and feathers and
eggs and all all the different things so

416
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,610
eggs and all all the different things so
 

417
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,440
eggs and all all the different things so
I'll be able to choose individually what

418
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,450
I'll be able to choose individually what
 

419
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:51,760
I'll be able to choose individually what
items I want sent where something like

420
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:51,770
items I want sent where something like
 

421
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,010
items I want sent where something like
that

422
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,020

not that was kind of embarrassing but
 

443
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,940
not that was kind of embarrassing but
you basically need a diagnosed stream of

time on a server yet anyway but I'm

578
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:06,380
time on a server yet anyway but I'm
 

579
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,690
time on a server yet anyway but I'm
going to be showing you the plan

580

going to be showing you the plan
 

581
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,800
going to be showing you the plan
so this is a control room on this side

582
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:15,810
so this is a control room on this side
 

583
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,460
so this is a control room on this side
and one of these sides we're going to

584
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,470
and one of these sides we're going to
 

585
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,320
and one of these sides we're going to
have levers for hostile mobs there's

586
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,330
have levers for hostile mobs there's
 

587
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,680
have levers for hostile mobs there's
going to be four options I think this

588
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:30,690
going to be four options I think this
 

589
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,020
going to be four options I think this
side will be for passive mobs there will

590
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,030
side will be for passive mobs there will
 

591
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,620
side will be for passive mobs there will
be five options five levers and I'm not

592
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,630
be five options five levers and I'm not
 

593
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,000
be five options five levers and I'm not
putting them there I'm just using this

594
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,010
putting them there I'm just using this
 

595
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:47,720
putting them there I'm just using this
example for the passive mobs one of

596
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:47,730
example for the passive mobs one of
 

597
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,820
example for the passive mobs one of
these levers we're going to run vertical

598
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:49,830
these levers we're going to run vertical
 

599
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:57,640
these levers we're going to run vertical
wire up so it'll be torches on the back

600
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:57,650
wire up so it'll be torches on the back
 

601
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:04,640
wire up so it'll be torches on the back
and you can run vertical wire by placing

602
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:04,650
and you can run vertical wire by placing
 

603
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,090
and you can run vertical wire by placing
a block above and then more torches and

604
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,100
a block above and then more torches and
 

605
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,160
a block above and then more torches and
keep the string going right now it's off

606
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,170
keep the string going right now it's off
 

607
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:18,140
keep the string going right now it's off
flip it on you can run as high as you

608
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,150
flip it on you can run as high as you
 

609
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:28,780
flip it on you can run as high as you

647
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,340
junction that will either send them to
the killing chamber or second option

648
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,350
the killing chamber or second option
 

649
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,050
the killing chamber or second option
will be to a like a caged area with a

650
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,060
will be to a like a caged area with a
 

651
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,310
will be to a like a caged area with a
water stream that pushes the eggs they

652
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,320
water stream that pushes the eggs they
 

653
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,000
water stream that pushes the eggs they
lake to our main collection area here

654
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,010
lake to our main collection area here
 

655
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,880
lake to our main collection area here
and say there's about 20 chickens in

656
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:04,890
and say there's about 20 chickens in
 

657
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,720
and say there's about 20 chickens in
your egg place if you switch this off

658
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:08,730
your egg place if you switch this off
 

659
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,850
your egg place if you switch this off
again then those 20 chickens will be

660
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:13,860
again then those 20 chickens will be
 

661
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,010
again then those 20 chickens will be
sent to the killing chamber and you'll

662
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,020
sent to the killing chamber and you'll
 

663
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,270
sent to the killing chamber and you'll
get the feathers from them and chickens

664
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,280
get the feathers from them and chickens
 

665
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,390
get the feathers from them and chickens
lay eggs every five minutes I believe

666
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,400

 

667
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,560

and oh yeah if if you're collecting eggs

668
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:33,570
and oh yeah if if you're collecting eggs
 

669
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,210
and oh yeah if if you're collecting eggs
the chickens won't die all the other

670
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,220
the chickens won't die all the other
 

671
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,420
the chickens won't die all the other
animals will so eventually the amount of

672
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,430
animals will so eventually the amount of
 

673
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,160
animals will so eventually the amount of
chickens you have will keep growing and

674
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,170
chickens you have will keep growing and
 

675
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,110
chickens you have will keep growing and
growing until you reach the limit and

676
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
growing until you reach the limit and
 

677
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,140
growing until you reach the limit and
you'll have probably 24 chickens

678
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,150
you'll have probably 24 chickens
 

679
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,420
you'll have probably 24 chickens
producing eggs without having to do what

680
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,430
producing eggs without having to do what
 

681
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,970
producing eggs without having to do what
some people do and spawn if you like do

682
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:56,980
some people do and spawn if you like do
 

683
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,010
some people do and spawn if you like do
a youtube search for chicken firms

684
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,020
a youtube search for chicken firms
 

685
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
a youtube search for chicken firms
they're all kind of cheap people just

686
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,030
they're all kind of cheap people just
 

687
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,930
they're all kind of cheap people just
shoot a bunch of eggs into a hole and

688
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:02,940
shoot a bunch of eggs into a hole and
 

689
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
shoot a bunch of eggs into a hole and
they call it a chicken farm this is

690
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:05,950
they call it a chicken farm this is
 

691
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,260
they call it a chicken farm this is
going to be a real chicken farm egg farm

692
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,270
going to be a real chicken farm egg farm

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:23,500
have a door junction for string and will
 

697
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,820
have a door junction for string and will
have a cook house a cook house is a path

698
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:29,830
have a cook house a cook house is a path
 

699

that the tall mobs will take where

700
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:32,860
that the tall mobs will take where
 

701
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,330
that the tall mobs will take where
they're exposed to sunlight and only the

702
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:36,340
they're exposed to sunlight and only the
 

703
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,820
they're exposed to sunlight and only the
creepers will survive or mostly just the

704
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:38,830
creepers will survive or mostly just the
 

705
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,520
creepers will survive or mostly just the
creepers and that will make it so pretty

706
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,530
creepers and that will make it so pretty
 

707
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,380
creepers and that will make it so pretty
much only gunpowder will drop

708
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:48,390
much only gunpowder will drop
 

709
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,880
much only gunpowder will drop
so if I have string shut off so the no

710
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:53,890
so if I have string shut off so the no
 

711
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,230
so if I have string shut off so the no
string will go to the collection point

712
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,240
string will go to the collection point
 

713
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,950
string will go to the collection point
and I have the cook house on pretty much

714
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
and I have the cook house on pretty much
 

715
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,040
and I have the cook house on pretty much
everything that comes to the collection

716
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,050
everything that comes to the collection
 

717
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,650
everything that comes to the collection
point will be gunpowder which would be a

718
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:04,660
point will be gunpowder which would be a
 

719
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:16,010
point will be gunpowder which would be a
nice feature and I've run out of signs

720
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,020

 

721
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:25,710

let's hope I have some left

722
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:25,720

 

723
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,680

okay really need to end this episode of

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:32,690
okay really need to end this episode of

quick I think record studio you guys
 

727
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,779
quick I think record studio you guys
know that's about kind of I'm going to

728
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:43,789
know that's about kind of I'm going to
 

729
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,580
know that's about kind of I'm going to
be using the same method in my record

730
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:45,590
be using the same method in my record
 

731
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,009
be using the same method in my record

wool hopefully you know I'm just going

734
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:57,799
wool hopefully you know I'm just going
 

735
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,169
wool hopefully you know I'm just going
to tell you guys what the method is if

736
00:27:59,169 --> 00:27:59,179
to tell you guys what the method is if
 

737
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,639
to tell you guys what the method is if
you watch ribbits video he made a way to

738
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:03,649
you watch ribbits video he made a way to
 

739
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,210
you watch ribbits video he made a way to
shear sheep he found a way skeletons

740
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,220
shear sheep he found a way skeletons
 

741
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,369
shear sheep he found a way skeletons
if they shoot sheep they'll shoot the

742
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:12,379
if they shoot sheep they'll shoot the
 

743
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:14,440
if they shoot sheep they'll shoot the
wall off the sheep and you can get wool

744
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,450
wall off the sheep and you can get wool
 

745
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,799
wall off the sheep and you can get wool
that way also works for fur creepers too

746
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:20,809
that way also works for fur creepers too
 

747
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,450
that way also works for fur creepers too
but I don't know how you do that

748
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:22,460
but I don't know how you do that
 

749
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,519
but I don't know how you do that
reliably so my plan is to have some way

750
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:27,529
reliably so my plan is to have some way
 

751
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,649
reliably so my plan is to have some way
of getting new skeletons

752
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:31,659
of getting new skeletons
 

753
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,450
of getting new skeletons
probably using the quick and dirty mop

754
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:34,460
probably using the quick and dirty mop
 

755
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,799
probably using the quick and dirty mop
separator method get them into isolated

756
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:38,809
separator method get them into isolated
 

757
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,950
separator method get them into isolated
locations and they'll be looking at each

758
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:41,960
locations and they'll be looking at each
 

759
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,169
locations and they'll be looking at each
other and I'm going to walk over on one

760
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:44,179
other and I'm going to walk over on one
 

761
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:47,379
other and I'm going to walk over on one
side of them and one skeletons going to

762
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:47,389
side of them and one skeletons going to
 

763
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:50,529
side of them and one skeletons going to
shoot the other skeleton and they're

764
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:50,539
shoot the other skeleton and they're
 

765
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,889
shoot the other skeleton and they're
going to enter a fight and I'll have

766
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:53,899
going to enter a fight and I'll have
 

767
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,810
going to enter a fight and I'll have
bamboo here or something to protect me

768
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:55,820
bamboo here or something to protect me
 

769
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,049
bamboo here or something to protect me
so I don't get shot and then I'll push a

770
00:28:59,049 --> 00:28:59,059
so I don't get shot and then I'll push a
 

771
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,169
so I don't get shot and then I'll push a
button and they'll get sent away through

772
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:02,179
button and they'll get sent away through
 

773
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,700
button and they'll get sent away through
the tube into each in their own separate

774
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:06,710
the tube into each in their own separate
 

775
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,680
the tube into each in their own separate
tube and then they're going to get sent

776
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:08,690
tube and then they're going to get sent
 

777
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,349
tube and then they're going to get sent
to a place where they'll both be on one

778
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:11,359
to a place where they'll both be on one
 

779
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,919
to a place where they'll both be on one
side and the sheep will come in between

780
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:14,929
side and the sheep will come in between
 

781
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,169
side and the sheep will come in between
them and while they're having their

782
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:17,179
them and while they're having their
 

783
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,450
them and while they're having their
fights I'm going to make it so they

784
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,460
fights I'm going to make it so they
 

785
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
fights I'm going to make it so they
can't actually kill each other and

786
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,070
can't actually kill each other and
 

787
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,839
can't actually kill each other and
they'll just be an endless fight forever

788
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:24,849
they'll just be an endless fight forever
 

789
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:27,089
they'll just be an endless fight forever
constantly shooting arrows at each other

790
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:27,099
constantly shooting arrows at each other
 

791
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,769
constantly shooting arrows at each other
so anything that passes in between them

792
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:29,779
so anything that passes in between them
 

793
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,560
so anything that passes in between them
like a sheep will get their wool shirt

794
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,570
like a sheep will get their wool shirt
 

795
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,110
like a sheep will get their wool shirt
off

796
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,120
off
 

797
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,630
off
or in the case of the record studio

798
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:37,640
or in the case of the record studio
 

799
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,670
or in the case of the record studio
I'll have the creepers down to one hits

800
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:39,680
I'll have the creepers down to one hits
 

801
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,400
I'll have the creepers down to one hits
and as they pass through they instantly

802
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,410
and as they pass through they instantly
 

803
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,520
and as they pass through they instantly
will produce a record and it all gets

804
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,530
will produce a record and it all gets
 

805
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,480
will produce a record and it all gets
