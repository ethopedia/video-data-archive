to see what the actual ranges are on the

70
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:02,579
to see what the actual ranges are on the
 

71
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,980
to see what the actual ranges are on the
things I guess um

72
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:04,990
things I guess um
 

73
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,339

rotten flesh ranges from 36 to 40 so

74
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:08,349
rotten flesh ranges from 36 to 40 so
 

75
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:13,440
rotten flesh ranges from 36 to 40 so
this is perfect gold 8 to 10 so it's in

76
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,450
this is perfect gold 8 to 10 so it's in
 

77
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,010
this is perfect gold 8 to 10 so it's in
the middle redstone you can get between

78
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,020
the middle redstone you can get between
 

79
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,000
the middle redstone you can get between
1 and 4 so this is again perfect lapis I

80
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,010
1 and 4 so this is again perfect lapis I
 

81
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,449
1 and 4 so this is again perfect lapis I
believe is 1 or 2 I didn't see a three

82
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:24,459
believe is 1 or 2 I didn't see a three
 

83
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,150
believe is 1 or 2 I didn't see a three
when I tried it so I think that's

84
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160
when I tried it so I think that's
 

85
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
when I tried it so I think that's
perfect as well possibly unless I missed

86
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,170
perfect as well possibly unless I missed
 

87
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,740
perfect as well possibly unless I missed
it I have the ender I didn't really pay

88

attention to this but no I saw it
costing 11 a few times so this is

92
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,610
costing 11 a few times so this is
 

93
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,240
costing 11 a few times so this is
probably a good price too

94
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,250
probably a good price too
 

95
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,640
probably a good price too

96
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:41,650
the only thing that's not quite perfect
 

97
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,330
the only thing that's not quite perfect
is the glowstone unfortunately this can

lapis or anything like that so I usually

162
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:21,949
lapis or anything like that so I usually
 

163
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,980
lapis or anything like that so I usually
don't even use this enchanting table

164
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:23,990
don't even use this enchanting table
 

165
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,629
don't even use this enchanting table
because it's so poorly set up at the

166
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:25,639
because it's so poorly set up at the
 

167
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,590
because it's so poorly set up at the
moment I think we should move this up to

168
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
moment I think we should move this up to
 

169
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,529
moment I think we should move this up to
here have it right by the ceiling area

170
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:32,539
here have it right by the ceiling area
 

171
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,240
here have it right by the ceiling area
and then have a book and a lapis

172
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,250
and then have a book and a lapis
 

173
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,760
and then have a book and a lapis
dispenser sort of thing so we'll do that

174
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:39,770
dispenser sort of thing so we'll do that
 

175
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,640
dispenser sort of thing so we'll do that
I also have to hop down from that portal

176
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,650
I also have to hop down from that portal
 

177
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,740
I also have to hop down from that portal
to arrive here and when I hop down I

178
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,750
to arrive here and when I hop down I
 

179
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,469
to arrive here and when I hop down I
usually take fall damage so we should

180
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:47,479
usually take fall damage so we should
 

181
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,060
usually take fall damage so we should
deal with that somehow

182
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,070
deal with that somehow
 

183
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,969
deal with that somehow
and I often go up there too to leave

184
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:51,979
and I often go up there too to leave
 

185
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,879
and I often go up there too to leave
this area so I have to I have to climb

186
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:54,889
this area so I have to I have to climb
 

187
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,330
this area so I have to I have to climb
this ladder and then jump across here

188
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:58,340
this ladder and then jump across here
 

189
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,659
this ladder and then jump across here
and sometimes when I'm feeling the

190
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:01,669
and sometimes when I'm feeling the
 

191
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,779
and sometimes when I'm feeling the
zombie pigmen there'll be one zombie

192
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:04,789
zombie pigmen there'll be one zombie
 

193
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,760
zombie pigmen there'll be one zombie
pigmen up here that would hop down and

194
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:06,770
pigmen up here that would hop down and
 

195
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,800
pigmen up here that would hop down and
kill me which is really bad this is how

196
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:11,810
kill me which is really bad this is how
 

197
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,980
kill me which is really bad this is how
I leave and then I fall in it's it's

198
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:14,990
I leave and then I fall in it's it's
 

199
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,920
I leave and then I fall in it's it's
messy is what I'm getting it so probably

200
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:17,930
messy is what I'm getting it so probably
 

201
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,330
messy is what I'm getting it so probably
the first thing we'll do actually we'll

202
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:19,340
the first thing we'll do actually we'll
 

203
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,430
the first thing we'll do actually we'll
set up a at this dinella Vater to take

204
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
set up a at this dinella Vater to take
 

205
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,100
set up a at this dinella Vater to take
us up there I think that would be a good

206
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,110
us up there I think that would be a good
 

207
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,420
us up there I think that would be a good
thing we should like yeah and have

208
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,430
thing we should like yeah and have
 

209
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,279
thing we should like yeah and have
something to dispense instant health

210
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,289
something to dispense instant health
 

211
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,760
something to dispense instant health
potions as well we should build like a

212
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:33,770
potions as well we should build like a
 

213
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,070
potions as well we should build like a
building or structure around this gold

214
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
building or structure around this gold
 

215
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
building or structure around this gold
farm not just have a floating thing up

216
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,810
farm not just have a floating thing up
 

217
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,409
farm not just have a floating thing up
in the sky like we do at the moment I

218
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:41,419
in the sky like we do at the moment I
 

219
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,960
in the sky like we do at the moment I
think that would be a lot better if we

220
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:43,970
think that would be a lot better if we
 

221
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,089
think that would be a lot better if we
can do something kind of nice because

222
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:46,099
can do something kind of nice because
 

223
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,050
can do something kind of nice because
that looks really bad maybe even have a

224
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,060
that looks really bad maybe even have a
 

225
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,240
that looks really bad maybe even have a
boat elevator to take us up to the

226
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,250
boat elevator to take us up to the
 

227
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,529
boat elevator to take us up to the
initial platform too but anyway touch is

228
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:56,539
initial platform too but anyway touch is
 

229
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,089
initial platform too but anyway touch is
cheap let me do some things here okay

230
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:01,099
cheap let me do some things here okay
 

231
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,530
cheap let me do some things here okay
very good we got our

232
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:02,540
very good we got our
 

233
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
very good we got our
I'd still care package together here I

234
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:04,550
I'd still care package together here I
 

235
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,300
I'd still care package together here I
believe we can get going on our elevator

236
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,310
believe we can get going on our elevator
 

237
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,420
believe we can get going on our elevator
and if I figured this out right this is

238
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,430
and if I figured this out right this is
 

239
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,830
and if I figured this out right this is
where we're going to be standing as we

240
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
where we're going to be standing as we
 

241
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,870
where we're going to be standing as we
go up at these two missing blocks here

242
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:13,880
go up at these two missing blocks here
 

243
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,480
go up at these two missing blocks here
so we'll start it like this we'll have

244
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,490
so we'll start it like this we'll have
 

245
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,330
so we'll start it like this we'll have
slime blocks in case we fall we want to

246
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,340
slime blocks in case we fall we want to
 

247
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,300
slime blocks in case we fall we want to
take fall damage and I think if we got

248
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,310
take fall damage and I think if we got
 

249
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,390
take fall damage and I think if we got
to go here next I might make them few

250
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
to go here next I might make them few
 

251
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,450
to go here next I might make them few
mistakes here so forgive me if I do I'll

252
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,460
mistakes here so forgive me if I do I'll
 

253
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,610
mistakes here so forgive me if I do I'll
correct them later but I'm going off

254
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:33,620
correct them later but I'm going off
 

255
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,740
correct them later but I'm going off
from memory and we're going to go for a

256
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:35,750
from memory and we're going to go for a
 

257
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,680
from memory and we're going to go for a
6x4

258
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,690
6x4
 

259
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,570
6x4
elevator design here there are smaller

260
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:40,580
elevator design here there are smaller
 

261
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,760
elevator design here there are smaller
ones like that there's a four by five

262
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:42,770
ones like that there's a four by five
 

263
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,910
ones like that there's a four by five
design that's pretty popular but in this

264
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:45,920
design that's pretty popular but in this
 

265
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,010
design that's pretty popular but in this
case I think this will work out better I

266
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,020
case I think this will work out better I
 

267
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,940
case I think this will work out better I
hope otherwise I got to make it come out

268
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:51,950
hope otherwise I got to make it come out
 

269
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,650
hope otherwise I got to make it come out
one more block further if I do the four

270
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:53,660
one more block further if I do the four
 

271
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,880
one more block further if I do the four
by five and even at this we might have

272
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:57,890
by five and even at this we might have
 

273
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,770
by five and even at this we might have
trouble because I'm building as close to

274
00:06:59,770 --> 00:06:59,780
trouble because I'm building as close to
 

275
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,080
trouble because I'm building as close to
this redstone as possible and the

276
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,090
this redstone as possible and the
 

277
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,050
this redstone as possible and the
redstone for my elevator might line up

278
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,060
redstone for my elevator might line up
 

279
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,450
redstone for my elevator might line up
with this hopefully it doesn't we'll see

280
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:07,460
with this hopefully it doesn't we'll see
 

281
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,960
with this hopefully it doesn't we'll see
how it works out though get a backing on

282
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:10,970
how it works out though get a backing on
 

283
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,530
how it works out though get a backing on
here all right and then I'll frame in

284
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:17,540
here all right and then I'll frame in
 

285
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,780
here all right and then I'll frame in
all this stuff like I'll make it look

286
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:19,790
all this stuff like I'll make it look
 

287
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,880
all this stuff like I'll make it look
like a column or something so you don't

288
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:21,890
like a column or something so you don't
 

289
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,470
like a column or something so you don't
see all the Redstone later um so I think

290
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:26,480
see all the Redstone later um so I think
 

291
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,040
see all the Redstone later um so I think
the way we do this if I didn't remember

292
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,050
the way we do this if I didn't remember
 

293
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,030
the way we do this if I didn't remember
something like this I'm just going to do

294
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,040
something like this I'm just going to do
 

295
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,320
something like this I'm just going to do
a little bit on camera and then I'll

296
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,330
a little bit on camera and then I'll
 

297
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,420
a little bit on camera and then I'll
finish it up off-camera just to give you

298
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,430
finish it up off-camera just to give you
 

299
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,700
finish it up off-camera just to give you
an idea of what I'm doing and how it

300
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:36,710
an idea of what I'm doing and how it
 

301
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,080
an idea of what I'm doing and how it
works I think we get repeaters at each

302
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,090
works I think we get repeaters at each
 

303
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,610
works I think we get repeaters at each
of these set to to another one over here

304
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:45,620
of these set to to another one over here
 

305
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:53,560
of these set to to another one over here
okay and then half slabs and there one

306
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,570
okay and then half slabs and there one
 

307
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,540
okay and then half slabs and there one
there do like a staircase of half slabs

308
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:55,550
there do like a staircase of half slabs
 

309
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,030
there do like a staircase of half slabs
like that repeater on all these and

310
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,040

 

311
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,620

they'll stick out hopefully this lined

312
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:02,630
they'll stick out hopefully this lined
 

313
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,829
they'll stick out hopefully this lined
up okay we'll see in just a second here

314
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:08,839

 

315
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,439

go over there whoa I thought it's gonna

316
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:12,449
go over there whoa I thought it's gonna
 

317
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,529
go over there whoa I thought it's gonna
fall down that hole that was a close one

318
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:15,539
fall down that hole that was a close one
 

319
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,449
fall down that hole that was a close one
oh I think it might work okay let's see

320
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:20,459
oh I think it might work okay let's see
 

321
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:27,889
oh I think it might work okay let's see
can we get around this might have to do

322
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:27,899
can we get around this might have to do
 

323
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,749
can we get around this might have to do
a bit of messy wiring but I think we

324
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
a bit of messy wiring but I think we
 

325
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,469
a bit of messy wiring but I think we
might be able to bypass it yeah that's

326
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:33,479
might be able to bypass it yeah that's
 

327
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:33,949
might be able to bypass it yeah that's
good

328
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
good
 

329
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,159
good
okay so that's the general idea to it

330
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,169
okay so that's the general idea to it
 

331
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,279
okay so that's the general idea to it
and then with this design the pistons

332
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,289
and then with this design the pistons
 

333
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,920
and then with this design the pistons
extend left and right instead of coming

334
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:42,930
extend left and right instead of coming
 

335
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,710
extend left and right instead of coming
out this way if they come out this way

336
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
out this way if they come out this way
 

337
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,809
out this way if they come out this way
they try to push you off so you need to

338
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:47,819
they try to push you off so you need to
 

339
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,999
they try to push you off so you need to
have a glass backing as well I think

340
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:50,009
have a glass backing as well I think
 

341
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,230
have a glass backing as well I think
with this one you don't need a glass

342
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
with this one you don't need a glass
 

343
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,720
with this one you don't need a glass
backing which is a little nicer as well

344
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,730
backing which is a little nicer as well
 

345
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,249
backing which is a little nicer as well
but anyway let me do a little bit

346
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:58,259
but anyway let me do a little bit
 

347
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,949
but anyway let me do a little bit
off-camera here and hopefully it works

348
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
off-camera here and hopefully it works
 

349
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,829
off-camera here and hopefully it works
out okay oh yeah we got our elevator

350
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
out okay oh yeah we got our elevator
 

351
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,369
out okay oh yeah we got our elevator
guys the guts of it anyway we might want

352
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:13,379
guys the guts of it anyway we might want
 

353
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,100
guys the guts of it anyway we might want
to pretty this up and put skin in front

354
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,110
to pretty this up and put skin in front
 

355
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,090
to pretty this up and put skin in front
of it of some sort but I haven't fully

356
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,100
of it of some sort but I haven't fully
 

357
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,920
of it of some sort but I haven't fully
decided what kind of blocks we want for

358
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:21,930
decided what kind of blocks we want for
 

359
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,189
decided what kind of blocks we want for
this building we're doing but the way it

360
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:25,199
this building we're doing but the way it
 

361
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,299
this building we're doing but the way it
works piston pushes this one out I

362
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:28,309
works piston pushes this one out I
 

363
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:31,340
works piston pushes this one out I
thought that was a bear as like what was

364
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,350
thought that was a bear as like what was
 

365
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,079
thought that was a bear as like what was
that noise that confused me for a second

366
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:36,089
that noise that confused me for a second
 

367
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,540
that noise that confused me for a second
I thought maybe I left the YouTube video

368
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,550
I thought maybe I left the YouTube video
 

369
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,629
I thought maybe I left the YouTube video
going in the background it's a zombie

370
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:41,639
going in the background it's a zombie
 

371
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,999
going in the background it's a zombie
pigman anyway so this pushes this out

372
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:44,009
pigman anyway so this pushes this out
 

373
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,439
pigman anyway so this pushes this out
and then this red clay gets powered from

374
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:48,449
and then this red clay gets powered from
 

375
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,519
and then this red clay gets powered from
the back by all this stuff here and it

376
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:52,529
the back by all this stuff here and it
 

377
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,369
the back by all this stuff here and it
snakes its way to the top so it goes

378
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:54,379
snakes its way to the top so it goes
 

379
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,249
snakes its way to the top so it goes
then then then then then zigzag all the

380
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:58,259
then then then then then zigzag all the
 

381
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,069
then then then then then zigzag all the
way up and that makes us go up and every

382
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:01,079
way up and that makes us go up and every
 

383
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,290
way up and that makes us go up and every
every tenth of a second one of these

384
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
every tenth of a second one of these
 

385
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,540
every tenth of a second one of these
Pistons will push you up a block so it's

386
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,550
Pistons will push you up a block so it's
 

387
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:12,560
Pistons will push you up a block so it's
ten blocks per second here we go

388
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,570

 

389
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,940

I'm still tuning this thing it it

390
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:14,950
I'm still tuning this thing it it
 

391
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,310
I'm still tuning this thing it it
punches me every time like a boxing

392
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,320
punches me every time like a boxing
 

393
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,750
punches me every time like a boxing
glove and slime blocks prevent you from

394
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
glove and slime blocks prevent you from
 

395
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,340
glove and slime blocks prevent you from
taking fall damage on the way down so

396
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,350
taking fall damage on the way down so
 

397
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,770
taking fall damage on the way down so
it's pretty good don't punch me start it

398
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:28,780
it's pretty good don't punch me start it
 

399
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,170
it's pretty good don't punch me start it
so I found out something cool too if you

400
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,180
so I found out something cool too if you
 

401
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,050
so I found out something cool too if you
don't know this with slime blocks if you

402
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,060
don't know this with slime blocks if you
 

403
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,430
don't know this with slime blocks if you
jump right when you hit them

404
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
jump right when you hit them
 

405
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,060
jump right when you hit them
you don't bounce up and you don't have

406
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,070
you don't bounce up and you don't have
 

407
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,680
you don't bounce up and you don't have
to wait 10 seconds before you're on the

408
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,690
to wait 10 seconds before you're on the
 

409
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,870
to wait 10 seconds before you're on the
ground sort of thing so that is pretty

410
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
ground sort of thing so that is pretty
 

411
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,140
ground sort of thing so that is pretty
cool you can use it for getting down

412
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,150
cool you can use it for getting down
 

413
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:50,310
cool you can use it for getting down
because of that like it's it's pretty

414
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
because of that like it's it's pretty
 

415
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,990
because of that like it's it's pretty
easy to do you just have to jump right

416
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
easy to do you just have to jump right
 

417
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,710
easy to do you just have to jump right
as you hit it so that's cool maybe let's

418
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
as you hit it so that's cool maybe let's
 

419
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,510
as you hit it so that's cool maybe let's
try make this thing stop punching us if

420
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:00,520
try make this thing stop punching us if
 

421
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:09,770
try make this thing stop punching us if
we get just the time is a bit more I

422
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:09,780

 

423
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,590

keep hearing zombie pigman suffocating

424
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
keep hearing zombie pigman suffocating
 

425
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,290
keep hearing zombie pigman suffocating
I'm worried the Redstone is getting

426
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm worried the Redstone is getting
 

427
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,370
I'm worried the Redstone is getting
activated over here mmm he seems to have

428
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,380
activated over here mmm he seems to have
 

429
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:32,340
activated over here mmm he seems to have
died getting run quick enough oh it is

430
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,350
died getting run quick enough oh it is
 

431
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:40,320
died getting run quick enough oh it is
getting activated no oh no really I was

432
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,330
getting activated no oh no really I was
 

433
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,350
getting activated no oh no really I was
sure I did this right where is it where

434
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
sure I did this right where is it where
 

435
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
sure I did this right where is it where
does that happening I was so careful

436
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,050
does that happening I was so careful
 

437
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,220
does that happening I was so careful
guys I swear I went all around the

438
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,230
guys I swear I went all around the
 

439
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,290
guys I swear I went all around the
wiring where is it connecting

440
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:55,300

 

441
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,240

I don't think it's connecting anywhere I

442
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,250
I don't think it's connecting anywhere I
 

443
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,220
I don't think it's connecting anywhere I
think it's is updating the pistons maybe

444
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,230
think it's is updating the pistons maybe
 

445
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:06,259
think it's is updating the pistons maybe
oh and not down I go be right back

446
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:06,269

 

447
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,850

mm-hmm that's what it was guys so this

448
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:08,860
mm-hmm that's what it was guys so this
 

449
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,000
mm-hmm that's what it was guys so this
these hopper timers they are affected by

450
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,010
these hopper timers they are affected by
 

451
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,519
these hopper timers they are affected by
block updates to the Pistons so when

452
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:14,529
block updates to the Pistons so when
 

453
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,069
block updates to the Pistons so when
this is receiving power it's causing an

454
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,079
this is receiving power it's causing an
 

455
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,160
this is receiving power it's causing an
update to it even though it's two blocks

456
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,170
update to it even though it's two blocks
 

457
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,540
update to it even though it's two blocks
away because that's the way it works it

458
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:23,550
away because that's the way it works it
 

459
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,860
away because that's the way it works it
is redstone effects up the two blocks

460
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:25,870
is redstone effects up the two blocks
 

461
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,920
is redstone effects up the two blocks
ways anyway I thought about it though it

462
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:28,930
ways anyway I thought about it though it
 

463
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,410
ways anyway I thought about it though it
doesn't really matter I could try to

464
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:31,420
doesn't really matter I could try to
 

465
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,740
doesn't really matter I could try to
lower this slab down one block then I'll

466
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:34,750
lower this slab down one block then I'll
 

467
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,780
lower this slab down one block then I'll
have to run the wire a little bit more

468
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:36,790
have to run the wire a little bit more
 

469
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,610
have to run the wire a little bit more
crazy again but it really doesn't matter

470
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:38,620
crazy again but it really doesn't matter
 

471
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,960
crazy again but it really doesn't matter
so I'm not going to bother with it

472
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:39,970
so I'm not going to bother with it
 

473
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,579
so I'm not going to bother with it
because I'll kill the zombie pigmen

474
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:41,589
because I'll kill the zombie pigmen
 

475
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,639
because I'll kill the zombie pigmen
before I leave the area so I don't have

476

before I leave the area so I don't have
 

477
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,300
before I leave the area so I don't have
to worry about the elevator killing them

478
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,310
to worry about the elevator killing them
 

479
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,889
to worry about the elevator killing them
oh did it really fail that's the first

480

oh did it really fail that's the first
 

481
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,490
oh did it really fail that's the first
time I failed I did it Phil

482
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:58,500
time I failed I did it Phil
 

483
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,230

I might have moved or something I don't

484
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
I might have moved or something I don't
 

485
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,040
I might have moved or something I don't
know I moved the portal up to here as

486
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,050
know I moved the portal up to here as
 

487
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,080
know I moved the portal up to here as
well and I worked out another problem I

488
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,090
well and I worked out another problem I
 

489
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,530
well and I worked out another problem I
was having so when I was going through

490
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:09,540
was having so when I was going through
 

491
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,730
was having so when I was going through
this this portal here it doesn't take me

492
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:13,740
this this portal here it doesn't take me
 

493
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,620
this this portal here it doesn't take me
on top of my nether because you can't

494
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,630
on top of my nether because you can't
 

495
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,270
on top of my nether because you can't
teleport up to above Y 128 in the nether

496
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,280
teleport up to above Y 128 in the nether
 

497
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,320
teleport up to above Y 128 in the nether
so I always would get teleported into

498
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,330
so I always would get teleported into
 

499
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,200
so I always would get teleported into
one of these these things and this is

500
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,210
one of these these things and this is
 

501
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,890
one of these these things and this is
almost like being in a trap if I don't

502
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:30,900
almost like being in a trap if I don't
 

503
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,440
almost like being in a trap if I don't
have ender pearls on my hotbar there is

504
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,450
have ender pearls on my hotbar there is
 

505
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,680
have ender pearls on my hotbar there is
no easy way out of this night to not

506
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:36,690
no easy way out of this night to not
 

507
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,070
no easy way out of this night to not
press my inventory selection even so if

508
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,080
press my inventory selection even so if
 

509
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,400
press my inventory selection even so if
they're not on my hotbar I'm pretty much

510
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,410
they're not on my hotbar I'm pretty much
 

511
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,430
they're not on my hotbar I'm pretty much
doomed I have to break the one of these

512
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,440
doomed I have to break the one of these
 

513
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,550
doomed I have to break the one of these
blocks and fall down basically so to

514
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:49,560
blocks and fall down basically so to
 

515
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,530
blocks and fall down basically so to
counter that I decide to put a portal

516
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:51,540
counter that I decide to put a portal
 

517
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,590
counter that I decide to put a portal
over here and it seems to do the trick

518
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:54,600
over here and it seems to do the trick
 

519
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,480
over here and it seems to do the trick
okay it's a little bit awkward where it

520
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,490
okay it's a little bit awkward where it
 

521
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:05,200
okay it's a little bit awkward where it
is but it should be fine uh-huh also I

522
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,210
is but it should be fine uh-huh also I
 

523
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,940
is but it should be fine uh-huh also I
I've been messing around with the slime

524
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:07,950
I've been messing around with the slime
 

525
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,480
I've been messing around with the slime
block stuff some more just to correct

526
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,490
block stuff some more just to correct
 

527
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,630
block stuff some more just to correct
what I said you don't have to time the

528
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:14,640
what I said you don't have to time the
 

529
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,370
what I said you don't have to time the
spacebar pressing and just hold spacebar

530
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,380
spacebar pressing and just hold spacebar
 

531
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,160
spacebar pressing and just hold spacebar
when you hit this so it doesn't even

532
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,170
when you hit this so it doesn't even
 

533
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,100
when you hit this so it doesn't even
take steel it you just hold spacebar if

534
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,110
take steel it you just hold spacebar if
 

535
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,840
take steel it you just hold spacebar if
you don't want to bounce which is pretty

536
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:23,850
you don't want to bounce which is pretty
 

537
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,210
you don't want to bounce which is pretty
cool so yeah now when we go up

538
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,220

 

539
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,889

this thing's pretty good though it only

540
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:30,899
this thing's pretty good though it only
 

541
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,150
this thing's pretty good though it only
really fails if by I just I should aim

542
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,160
really fails if by I just I should aim
 

543
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,980
really fails if by I just I should aim
for the slime blocks if I go up right

544
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:36,990
for the slime blocks if I go up right
 

545
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,569
for the slime blocks if I go up right
against the wall on the right side here

546
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:40,579
against the wall on the right side here
 

547
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,920
against the wall on the right side here
but if I'm in the middle or even right

548
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:42,930
but if I'm in the middle or even right
 

549
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,170
but if I'm in the middle or even right
on the left side like all the way here

550
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,180
on the left side like all the way here
 

551
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,949
on the left side like all the way here
it seems fine course it will they'll

552
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
it seems fine course it will they'll
 

553
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,269
it seems fine course it will they'll
probably Hut it'll probably give you

554
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:50,279
probably Hut it'll probably give you
 

555
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:57,619
probably Hut it'll probably give you
trouble in S&P all right so yeah we

556
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:57,629
trouble in S&P all right so yeah we
 

557
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:05,499
trouble in S&P all right so yeah we
takes us to here very good hmm

558
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:05,509
takes us to here very good hmm
 

559

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:11,430
like each other look at that guy run oh
 

563
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,150
like each other look at that guy run oh
no no no and he attacks quick doesn't he

564
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
no no no and he attacks quick doesn't he
 

565
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,970

first endermite I ever killed amazing

566
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:21,980

 

567
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,319

creepers are definitely having trouble

568
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:24,329
creepers are definitely having trouble
 

569
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,230
creepers are definitely having trouble
in water

570
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
in water
 

571
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,449
in water
yeah you can barely move so I wanted to

572
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:32,459
yeah you can barely move so I wanted to
 

573
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,429
yeah you can barely move so I wanted to
hop down here to get a side profile of

574
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:34,439
hop down here to get a side profile of
 

575
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,780
hop down here to get a side profile of
what we've built now that we got the

576
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,790
what we've built now that we got the
 

577
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,119
what we've built now that we got the
elevator on because we're at the point

578
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:38,129
elevator on because we're at the point
 

579
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,210
elevator on because we're at the point
where I I really need to think about a

580
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,220
where I I really need to think about a
 

581
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,249
where I I really need to think about a
building plan what is the layout going

582
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:43,259
building plan what is the layout going
 

583
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,249
building plan what is the layout going
to be what blocks are we using like the

584
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:46,259
to be what blocks are we using like the
 

585
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,769
to be what blocks are we using like the
style of the building so it is pretty

586
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:48,779
style of the building so it is pretty
 

587
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,400
style of the building so it is pretty
tall it's going to be a tall building we

588
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,410
tall it's going to be a tall building we
 

589
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,780
tall it's going to be a tall building we
don't really need a lot of floor space

590
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:53,790
don't really need a lot of floor space
 

591
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,110
don't really need a lot of floor space
so and I think since we used all this

592
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
so and I think since we used all this
 

593
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,480
so and I think since we used all this
clay let's go for a a somewhat

594
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,490
clay let's go for a a somewhat
 

595
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,400
clay let's go for a a somewhat
futuristic look to the building maybe

596
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,410
futuristic look to the building maybe
 

597
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,030
futuristic look to the building maybe
like some high-tech office space would

598
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
like some high-tech office space would
 

599
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,530
like some high-tech office space would
be cool and a little bit abstract as

600
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:09,540
be cool and a little bit abstract as
 

601
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,749
be cool and a little bit abstract as
well would be nice mmm you know it would

602
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:14,759
well would be nice mmm you know it would
 

603
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,439
well would be nice mmm you know it would
be cool I think what I want to do let's

604
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:18,449
be cool I think what I want to do let's
 

605
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,929
be cool I think what I want to do let's
do poops

606
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:20,939
do poops
 

607
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,970
do poops
you remember my honeycomb Labs or

608
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:22,980
you remember my honeycomb Labs or
 

609
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,400
you remember my honeycomb Labs or
beetles lamps from feed the beasts I

610
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,410
beetles lamps from feed the beasts I
 

611
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,710
beetles lamps from feed the beasts I
think I want to do something similar to

612
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,720
think I want to do something similar to
 

613
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,900
think I want to do something similar to
that the hexagon I really like how

614
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:29,910
that the hexagon I really like how
 

615
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,230
that the hexagon I really like how
hexagons look in Minecraft but instead

616
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,240
hexagons look in Minecraft but instead
 

617
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,500
hexagons look in Minecraft but instead
of doing Oh

618
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,510

 

619
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,060

instead of doing the full-blown like

620
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,070
instead of doing the full-blown like
 

621
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,250
instead of doing the full-blown like
honeycomb layout let's just do like

622
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,260
honeycomb layout let's just do like
 

623
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,590
honeycomb layout let's just do like
three hexagons together and see what

624
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:44,600
three hexagons together and see what
 

625
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,180
three hexagons together and see what
that looks like like kind of lay them

626
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,190
that looks like like kind of lay them
 

627
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,010
that looks like like kind of lay them
out like that um and that might be

628
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,020
out like that um and that might be
 

629
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,650
out like that um and that might be
pretty cool and have it like go up way

630
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:53,660
pretty cool and have it like go up way
 

631
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,769
pretty cool and have it like go up way
way up to the top of the elevator there

632
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:58,779

 

633
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,070

hmm

634
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,080
hmm
 

635
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,230
hmm
so I've tried out the hexagons I don't

636
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
so I've tried out the hexagons I don't
 

637
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,689
so I've tried out the hexagons I don't
think it's going to work though I was

638
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:04,699
think it's going to work though I was
 

639
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,390
think it's going to work though I was
trying it here and I decided I want it

640
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,400
trying it here and I decided I want it
 

641
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,520
trying it here and I decided I want it
to this part of the building to stick

642
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,530
to this part of the building to stick
 

643
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,460
to this part of the building to stick
out about up to here right if I did a

644
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:12,470
out about up to here right if I did a
 

645
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,059
out about up to here right if I did a
hexagon the walls of the hexagon end up

646
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:16,069
hexagon the walls of the hexagon end up
 

647
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,000
hexagon the walls of the hexagon end up
being like from here to here so there's

648
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,010
being like from here to here so there's
 

649
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,760
being like from here to here so there's
no I want like a walkway to get to the

650
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:21,770
no I want like a walkway to get to the
 

651
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,710
no I want like a walkway to get to the
other side of the building so that

652
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:23,720
other side of the building so that
 

653
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,250
other side of the building so that
wasn't really working so instead we're

654
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,260
wasn't really working so instead we're
 

655
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,900
wasn't really working so instead we're
going for more of a custom shape this is

656
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:28,910
going for more of a custom shape this is
 

657
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,460
going for more of a custom shape this is
more like an octagon I I suppose and got

658
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,470
more like an octagon I I suppose and got
 

659
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,950
more like an octagon I I suppose and got
it going around like this and we'll make

660
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:35,960
it going around like this and we'll make
 

661
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,310
it going around like this and we'll make
go a little bit further and what I want

662
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,320
go a little bit further and what I want
 

663
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,990
go a little bit further and what I want
to do I want to have like windows going

664
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,000
to do I want to have like windows going
 

665
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,240
to do I want to have like windows going
from the ground all the way up to the

666
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,250
from the ground all the way up to the
 

667
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,190
from the ground all the way up to the
top of the building which will probably

668
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
top of the building which will probably
 

669
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,730
top of the building which will probably
be the height of elevator I suppose lots

670
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:48,740
be the height of elevator I suppose lots
 

671
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,840
be the height of elevator I suppose lots
of open air space don't want to get too

672
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:52,850
of open air space don't want to get too
 

673
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,919
of open air space don't want to get too
crazy with the details and I suppose do

674
00:17:59,919 --> 00:17:59,929
crazy with the details and I suppose do
 

675
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,990
crazy with the details and I suppose do
we just want to to remake it widen out

676
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
we just want to to remake it widen out
 

677
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,250
we just want to to remake it widen out
here I don't know mm let's just keep

678
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,260
here I don't know mm let's just keep
 

679
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,549
here I don't know mm let's just keep
going like this or you know what here's

680
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
going like this or you know what here's
 

681
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,020
going like this or you know what here's
what we'll do let's figure out where we

682
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,030
what we'll do let's figure out where we
 

683
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,440
what we'll do let's figure out where we
want the enchanting table so I want some

684
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,450
want the enchanting table so I want some
 

685
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,570
want the enchanting table so I want some
some free space here because it's where

686
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:19,580
some free space here because it's where
 

687
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,549
some free space here because it's where
I like to stand when I'm looking at the

688
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:21,559
I like to stand when I'm looking at the
 

689
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,320
I like to stand when I'm looking at the
zombie pigmen so maybe 1 2 3 4 5 up to

690
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,330
zombie pigmen so maybe 1 2 3 4 5 up to
 

691
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,320
zombie pigmen so maybe 1 2 3 4 5 up to
the chest maybe we'll start the

692
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,330
the chest maybe we'll start the
 

693
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,020
the chest maybe we'll start the
enchanting area beyond this chest let's

694
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,030
enchanting area beyond this chest let's
 

695
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,910
enchanting area beyond this chest let's
just extend this out and we will lay

696
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:36,920
just extend this out and we will lay
 

697
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,669
just extend this out and we will lay
down oh you know what oh wait a minute

698
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:42,679
down oh you know what oh wait a minute
 

699
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,150
down oh you know what oh wait a minute
this is even numbers enchanting areas

700
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
this is even numbers enchanting areas
 

701
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,630
this is even numbers enchanting areas
are usually odd number base straight

702
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
are usually odd number base straight
 

703
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,390
are usually odd number base straight
oops

704
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
oops
 

705
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,070
oops
that's not so good maybe instead we'll

706
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,080
that's not so good maybe instead we'll
 

707
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,070
that's not so good maybe instead we'll
have we got to get the villager up here

708
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
have we got to get the villager up here
 

709
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,570
have we got to get the villager up here
to is the other thing so maybe we'll

710
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,580
to is the other thing so maybe we'll
 

711
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,220
to is the other thing so maybe we'll
have like we'll split this into two so

712
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,230
have like we'll split this into two so
 

713
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,740
have like we'll split this into two so
on one side like over here we'll have

714
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:06,750
on one side like over here we'll have
 

715
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,380
on one side like over here we'll have
the enchanting area set up the other

716
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,390
the enchanting area set up the other
 

717
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,240
the enchanting area set up the other
side will have like a villager counter

718
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,250
side will have like a villager counter
 

719
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,590
side will have like a villager counter
sort of thing where we can trade them

720
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,600
sort of thing where we can trade them
 

721
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,840
sort of thing where we can trade them
zombie flesh in that I think that would

722
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:14,850
zombie flesh in that I think that would
 

723
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,750
zombie flesh in that I think that would
be a good way of doing it and that

724
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:16,760
be a good way of doing it and that
 

725
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,100
be a good way of doing it and that
solves our even number issue I'm just

726
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,110
solves our even number issue I'm just
 

727
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,750
solves our even number issue I'm just
making the ground all cyan clay right

this clay floor like this plain boring

750
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:55,980
this clay floor like this plain boring
 

751
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,669
this clay floor like this plain boring
clay floor we'll try to incorporate some

752
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:58,679
clay floor we'll try to incorporate some
 

753
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,740
clay floor we'll try to incorporate some
of this into the flooring and see what

754
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:00,750
of this into the flooring and see what
 

755
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,080
of this into the flooring and see what
this is like

756
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,090
this is like
 

757
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,410
this is like
maybe we'll bring this over Wow well

758
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:06,420
maybe we'll bring this over Wow well
 

759
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,120
maybe we'll bring this over Wow well
most likely have a block of something

760
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,130
most likely have a block of something
 

761

here to cover up the redstone too so the

762
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,190
here to cover up the redstone too so the
 

763
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,160
here to cover up the redstone too so the
path will have one block of clay on the

764
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,170
path will have one block of clay on the
 

765
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,710
path will have one block of clay on the
left and on the right we'll bring this

766
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:15,720
left and on the right we'll bring this
 

767
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,900
left and on the right we'll bring this
out Oh

768
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:20,910

 

769
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,750

building it's so much fun I never know

770
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
building it's so much fun I never know
 

771
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,930
building it's so much fun I never know
what to do let's bring this out so I

772
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:29,940
what to do let's bring this out so I
 

773
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,540
what to do let's bring this out so I
feel like I want this to be almost like

774
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:32,550
feel like I want this to be almost like
 

775
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,660
feel like I want this to be almost like
a tunnel these side paths that I got and

776
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:35,670
a tunnel these side paths that I got and
 

777
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,060
a tunnel these side paths that I got and
then this will be a big room and then

778
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,070
then this will be a big room and then
 

779
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,160
then this will be a big room and then
we'll have a big room a bigger room over

780
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,170
we'll have a big room a bigger room over
 

781
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,370
we'll have a big room a bigger room over
here for these side paths these tunnels

782
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,380
here for these side paths these tunnels
 

783
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,510
here for these side paths these tunnels
we won't do too much let's see

784
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
we won't do too much let's see
 

785
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,350
we won't do too much let's see
where is the middle that's a question

786
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,360
where is the middle that's a question
 

787
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,960
where is the middle that's a question
one two three four five six seven eight

788
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:57,970
one two three four five six seven eight
 

789
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,120
one two three four five six seven eight
nine kinda so two three four five I

790
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,130
nine kinda so two three four five I
 

791
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,880

might

850
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,320
might
 

851
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,590

00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,280
feel a really solid I like them a lot
I don't think they need to be adjusted

922
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,290
I don't think they need to be adjusted
 

923
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,470
I don't think they need to be adjusted
too much um I don't like the random

924
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:01,480
too much um I don't like the random
 

925
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,810
too much um I don't like the random
damage aspect to combat in this game

926
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:03,820
damage aspect to combat in this game
 

927
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,590
damage aspect to combat in this game
like bows and swords both have a random

928
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
like bows and swords both have a random
 

929
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,500
like bows and swords both have a random
factor to them I think damage should be

930
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,510
factor to them I think damage should be
 

931
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,320
factor to them I think damage should be
more consistent that would be better I

932
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,330
more consistent that would be better I
 

933
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,480
more consistent that would be better I
like like you want it to be predictable

934
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,490
like like you want it to be predictable
 

935
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,590
like like you want it to be predictable
right it being random makes

936
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:18,600
right it being random makes
 

937
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,659
right it being random makes
more fun but I don't think a lot of

938
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:20,669
more fun but I don't think a lot of
 

939
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,230
more fun but I don't think a lot of
people really notice it until light

940
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
people really notice it until light
 

941
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,500
people really notice it until light
unless you're watching the the the fight

942
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,510
unless you're watching the the the fight
 

943
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,330
unless you're watching the the the fight
back frame to frame you you probably

944
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,340
back frame to frame you you probably
 

945
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,590
back frame to frame you you probably
won't notice the random damage so I

946
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
won't notice the random damage so I
 

947
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,270
won't notice the random damage so I
don't think it really adds anything to

948
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,280
don't think it really adds anything to
 

949
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,560
don't think it really adds anything to
the game um I feel the bow might benefit

950
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:39,570
the game um I feel the bow might benefit
 

951
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,190
the game um I feel the bow might benefit
from a bit more accuracy for long-range

952
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
from a bit more accuracy for long-range
 

953
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,560
from a bit more accuracy for long-range
shots because at a really long range

954
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,570
shots because at a really long range
 

955
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,299
shots because at a really long range
shot it's almost like a 1 and a chance

956
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:47,309
shot it's almost like a 1 and a chance
 

957
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,750
shot it's almost like a 1 and a chance
even if it's perfectly lined up just

958
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,760
even if it's perfectly lined up just
 

959
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,070
even if it's perfectly lined up just
because the shot sort of goes to the

960
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,080
because the shot sort of goes to the
 

961
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,010
because the shot sort of goes to the
left or right a bit we're up and down um

962
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,020

 

963
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,970

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:04,980
which I don't know I think that being
 

965
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,740
which I don't know I think that being
inaccurate is good to an extent but

966
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:06,750
inaccurate is good to an extent but
 

967
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,600
inaccurate is good to an extent but
maybe not to the degree it is I think

968
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,610
maybe not to the degree it is I think
 

969
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,470
maybe not to the degree it is I think
they could make it a bit better the big

going in the game because it's pretty

the big skill involved with swordplay is

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,200
the big skill involved with swordplay is

keeping your cursor on the guy that's
true and I think that's good people seem

996
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:53,700
true and I think that's good people seem
 

997
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,980
true and I think that's good people seem
to like strafe around left and right too

998
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:56,990
to like strafe around left and right too
 

999
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,320
to like strafe around left and right too
but overall it's not I don't feel it's a

1000
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,330
but overall it's not I don't feel it's a
 

1001
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,570
but overall it's not I don't feel it's a
really good exchange of blows it's more

1002
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,580
really good exchange of blows it's more
 

1003
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,340
really good exchange of blows it's more
oh it's unsatisfying I think they need

1004
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,350
oh it's unsatisfying I think they need
 

1005
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,380
oh it's unsatisfying I think they need
to change it so that the tacks are

1006
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,390
to change it so that the tacks are
 

1007
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,630
to change it so that the tacks are
slowed down a lot more like maybe one

1008
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:11,640
slowed down a lot more like maybe one
 

1009
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,409
slowed down a lot more like maybe one
every second or two and you go wait for

1010
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:15,419
every second or two and you go wait for
 

1011
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,230
every second or two and you go wait for
the cooldown before you can attack again

1012
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,240
the cooldown before you can attack again
 

1013
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,510
the cooldown before you can attack again
yeah and also I think they should

1014
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:20,520
yeah and also I think they should
 

1015
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,880
yeah and also I think they should
incorporate blocking into combat like if

1016
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:22,890
incorporate blocking into combat like if
 

1017
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,620
incorporate blocking into combat like if
you're blocking somebody hits you then

1018
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:26,630
you're blocking somebody hits you then
 

1019
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,890
you're blocking somebody hits you then
it negates the damage you know but again

1020
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:30,900
it negates the damage you know but again
 

1021
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,509
it negates the damage you know but again
I think blocking should have a

1022
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:32,519
I think blocking should have a
 

1023
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,159
I think blocking should have a
cool down as well so you can't diss Pam

1024
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:34,169
cool down as well so you can't diss Pam
 

1025
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,959
cool down as well so you can't diss Pam
blocking um and with some mechanics I

1026
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:38,969
blocking um and with some mechanics I
 

1027
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:40,430
blocking um and with some mechanics I
think they could work out a pretty good

1028
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:40,440
think they could work out a pretty good
 

1029
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,690
think they could work out a pretty good
sword battling system with that the

1030
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:44,700
sword battling system with that the
 

1031
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,190
sword battling system with that the
other big change I would like to see

1032
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,200
other big change I would like to see
 

1033
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,949
other big change I would like to see
this is a really simple thing that I

1034
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:48,959
this is a really simple thing that I
 

1035
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,469
this is a really simple thing that I
definitely think they should do is make

1036
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:51,479
definitely think they should do is make
 

1037
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:53,839
definitely think they should do is make
it so splash potions you can hold right

1038
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:53,849
it so splash potions you can hold right
 

1039
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,719
it so splash potions you can hold right
click wait what would you use to throw I

1040
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:56,729
click wait what would you use to throw I
 

1041
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,609
click wait what would you use to throw I
think it's right click yeah hold right

1042
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:58,619
think it's right click yeah hold right
 

1043
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,820
think it's right click yeah hold right
click to charge up your throw and the

1044
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:01,830
click to charge up your throw and the
 

1045
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,379
click to charge up your throw and the
longer you hold it the farther you throw

1046
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:03,389
longer you hold it the farther you throw
 

1047
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:07,339
longer you hold it the farther you throw
it so maybe you can throw it up to 32

1048
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:07,349
it so maybe you can throw it up to 32
 

1049
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,190
it so maybe you can throw it up to 32
blocks or maybe a little bit further if

1050
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,200
blocks or maybe a little bit further if
 

1051
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,560
blocks or maybe a little bit further if
you do a full charge but you can adjust

1052
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:12,570
you do a full charge but you can adjust
 

1053
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,119
you do a full charge but you can adjust
how far you want to throw it by health

1054
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:14,129
how far you want to throw it by health
 

1055
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:18,709
how far you want to throw it by health
how long you hold right click because as

1056
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:18,719
how long you hold right click because as
 

1057
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:21,199
how long you hold right click because as
it is if you're running and you're

1058
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:21,209
it is if you're running and you're
 

1059
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,299
it is if you're running and you're
throwing damaged potions you run into

1060
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:23,309
throwing damaged potions you run into
 

1061
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,879
throwing damaged potions you run into
them and it's really dumb anyway

1062
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:27,889
them and it's really dumb anyway
 

1063
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,799
them and it's really dumb anyway
those are some of my ideas so that's

1064
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:30,809
those are some of my ideas so that's
 

1065
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,089
those are some of my ideas so that's
going to be it for today's episode guys

1066
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:32,099
going to be it for today's episode guys
 

1067
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,949
going to be it for today's episode guys
