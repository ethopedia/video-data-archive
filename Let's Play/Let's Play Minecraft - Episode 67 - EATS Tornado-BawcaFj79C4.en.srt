hey everyone is down here working on
eats eats Road and I've discovered that

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,330
eats eats Road and I've discovered that
 

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,959
eats eats Road and I've discovered that
I really do not like mining very much

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:14,969
I really do not like mining very much
 

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,910
I really do not like mining very much
unless there's a chance of getting

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
unless there's a chance of getting
 

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,720
unless there's a chance of getting
redstone diamonds or gold otherwise it's

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:20,730
redstone diamonds or gold otherwise it's
 

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,480
redstone diamonds or gold otherwise it's
just boring so finish mining out the

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,490
just boring so finish mining out the
 

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,570
just boring so finish mining out the
rest of this I've just done my TNT chain

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:29,580
rest of this I've just done my TNT chain
 

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,840
rest of this I've just done my TNT chain
here they're spaced five blocks apart

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:32,850
here they're spaced five blocks apart
 

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,770
here they're spaced five blocks apart
from each other this is longest chain

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:36,780
from each other this is longest chain
 

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,610
from each other this is longest chain
I've done yet it's forty PNP total so I

20
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,620
I've done yet it's forty PNP total so I
 

21
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,950
I've done yet it's forty PNP total so I
thought you might like to see it and I'm

22
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
thought you might like to see it and I'm
 

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,029
thought you might like to see it and I'm
just gonna put a lever on it and so

24
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
just gonna put a lever on it and so
 

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,560
just gonna put a lever on it and so
instead of mining out this whole 3x3

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,570
instead of mining out this whole 3x3
 

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,270
instead of mining out this whole 3x3
wide by four high thing I just stepped

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
wide by four high thing I just stepped
 

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,299
wide by four high thing I just stepped
the mine out the one wide by two high

30
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,309
the mine out the one wide by two high
 

31
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,210
the mine out the one wide by two high
area so it goes much faster if you use

32
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,220
area so it goes much faster if you use
 

33
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:18,120
area so it goes much faster if you use
TNT

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,130

 

35
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,910

oh I must've made a mistake son

36
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
oh I must've made a mistake son
 

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:41,059
oh I must've made a mistake son
I think travels fast

38
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,069

 

39
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:56,490

another dead end so I guess it's not

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,500
another dead end so I guess it's not
 

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,859
another dead end so I guess it's not
perfect if it's five blocks apart like a

42
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:01,869
perfect if it's five blocks apart like a
 

43
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,699
perfect if it's five blocks apart like a
four block spacing and the TNT being the

44
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:05,709
four block spacing and the TNT being the
 

45
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:30,059
four block spacing and the TNT being the
fifth block failed again unreal

46
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:30,069

 

47
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:38,110

so and that's it that's done that was

48
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,120
so and that's it that's done that was
 

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,460
so and that's it that's done that was
about a hundred blocks in length didn't

50
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,470
about a hundred blocks in length didn't
 

51
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,770
about a hundred blocks in length didn't
take too long so now I just need to run

52
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:46,780
take too long so now I just need to run
 

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,559
take too long so now I just need to run
the road which takes a while and clean

54
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:53,569
the road which takes a while and clean
 

55
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:00,670
the road which takes a while and clean

the East Road I just dug down these on

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,290
the East Road I just dug down these on
 

61
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,440
the East Road I just dug down these on
the left and the right here and I filled

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,450
the left and the right here and I filled
 

63
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,110
the left and the right here and I filled
it in with wood all the way down it's

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
it in with wood all the way down it's
 

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,620
it in with wood all the way down it's
really really far and now I have to put

66
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:14,630
really really far and now I have to put
 

67
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,490
really really far and now I have to put
all these apps labs here all the way

68
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:18,500
all these apps labs here all the way
 

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,490
all these apps labs here all the way
down over over a hundred blocks this

70
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,500
down over over a hundred blocks this
 

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,729
down over over a hundred blocks this
roads gonna be I think at least 200

72
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:27,739
roads gonna be I think at least 200
 

73
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:34,840
roads gonna be I think at least 200
blocks long or 0.2 kilometers and it's

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:34,850
blocks long or 0.2 kilometers and it's
 

75
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,229
blocks long or 0.2 kilometers and it's
just gonna be a straight road nothing

76
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
just gonna be a straight road nothing
 

77
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:38,979
just gonna be a straight road nothing
fancy

78
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:38,989
fancy
 

79
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,560
fancy
really with wild OB an elevator going

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,570
really with wild OB an elevator going
 

81
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,750
really with wild OB an elevator going
back up to the surface at the end there

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
back up to the surface at the end there
 

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,340
back up to the surface at the end there
I found this huge hole here which so I

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,350
I found this huge hole here which so I
 

85
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,360
I found this huge hole here which so I
might put glass over top it I don't know

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,370
might put glass over top it I don't know
 

87
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,660
might put glass over top it I don't know
and that's all there is to this I'll

88
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:55,670
and that's all there is to this I'll
 

89
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,030
and that's all there is to this I'll
probably change the sides make it look a

90
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,040
probably change the sides make it look a
 

91
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,970
probably change the sides make it look a
little bit more polished and it's

92
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:00,980
little bit more polished and it's
 

93
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,340
little bit more polished and it's
thinking about replacing the roof with

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,350
thinking about replacing the roof with
 

95
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:10,030
thinking about replacing the roof with
or the ceiling with sandstone and that's

96
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,040
or the ceiling with sandstone and that's
 

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,219
or the ceiling with sandstone and that's
my plan

98
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:15,229

 

99
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:19,129

mm-hmm well it seems I forgot to do a

100
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:19,139
mm-hmm well it seems I forgot to do a
 

101
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,370
mm-hmm well it seems I forgot to do a
few progress updates and now we're

102
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,380
few progress updates and now we're
 

103
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,860
few progress updates and now we're
really far into the construction of the

104
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:24,870
really far into the construction of the
 

105
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,490
really far into the construction of the
East Road where to begin well I did

106
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:31,500
East Road where to begin well I did
 

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,730
East Road where to begin well I did
replace the ceiling with sandstone and

108
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:34,740
replace the ceiling with sandstone and
 

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,870
replace the ceiling with sandstone and
there's torches little little lights

110
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
there's torches little little lights
 

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,189
there's torches little little lights
above it looks nice

112
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:40,199
above it looks nice
 

113
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,159
above it looks nice
and then on the left this is how I'm

114
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,169
and then on the left this is how I'm
 

115
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,730
and then on the left this is how I'm
planning on doing it I believe we have

116
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:46,740
planning on doing it I believe we have
 

117
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,040
planning on doing it I believe we have
flowers that are gonna go all the way

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,050
flowers that are gonna go all the way
 

119
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,700
flowers that are gonna go all the way
long same width on the right side and

120
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:51,710
long same width on the right side and
 

121
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,710
long same width on the right side and
they have little spotlights above to

122
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
they have little spotlights above to
 

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,719
they have little spotlights above to
make them stand out kind of and some of

124
00:04:59,719 --> 00:04:59,729
make them stand out kind of and some of
 

125
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,240
make them stand out kind of and some of
my torches got destroyed and yeah

126
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,250
my torches got destroyed and yeah
 

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,500
my torches got destroyed and yeah
so lots and lots of work to this

128
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,510

 

129
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,370

obviously if you guys are planning to

130
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,380
obviously if you guys are planning to
 

131
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,020
obviously if you guys are planning to
make an eats Road you don't need to do

132
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,030
make an eats Road you don't need to do
 

133
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,339
make an eats Road you don't need to do
this much to build it really all you

134
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:19,349
this much to build it really all you
 

135
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,379
this much to build it really all you
need is a three wide by two high tunnel

136
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:24,389
need is a three wide by two high tunnel
 

137
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,159
need is a three wide by two high tunnel
minimum and you can make it bigger if

138
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:28,169
minimum and you can make it bigger if
 

139
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,659
minimum and you can make it bigger if
you want so mine's a six wide by four

140
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:32,669
you want so mine's a six wide by four
 

141
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,379
you want so mine's a six wide by four
high now with these little things on the

142
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:36,389
high now with these little things on the
 

143
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,310
high now with these little things on the
sides as well and I've replaced all the

144
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
sides as well and I've replaced all the
 

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,159
sides as well and I've replaced all the
blocks with wood and sandstone just to

146
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,169
blocks with wood and sandstone just to
 

147
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,279
blocks with wood and sandstone just to
have a nice polished look to it and yeah

148
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,289
have a nice polished look to it and yeah
 

149
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,800
have a nice polished look to it and yeah
it's going along pretty good

150
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:57,810

 

151
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,240

the way I'm doing this is that basically

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,250
the way I'm doing this is that basically
 

153
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,490
the way I'm doing this is that basically
I have to go all the way along the top

154
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:02,500
I have to go all the way along the top
 

155
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:12,480
I have to go all the way along the top
here movies all the way along then I

156
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,490
here movies all the way along then I
 

157
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,260
here movies all the way along then I
need to do it again one more block in go

158
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,270
need to do it again one more block in go
 

159
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,430
need to do it again one more block in go
all the way down the full 150 blocks or

160
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,440
all the way down the full 150 blocks or
 

161
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,500
all the way down the full 150 blocks or
whatever this lower part is and then

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,510

obviously I'm not gonna show you the
entire construction of this because it

188
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,300
entire construction of this because it
 

189
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,810
entire construction of this because it
would it took too long I'm sure I've

see it from down there so lots of lots a
 

225
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,660
see it from down there so lots of lots a
little detail to building this and then

226
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:57,670
little detail to building this and then
 

227
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,060
little detail to building this and then
I fill in you know like that so we have

228
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,070
I fill in you know like that so we have
 

229
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,570
I fill in you know like that so we have
been doing it it's going pretty quick

230
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:06,580
been doing it it's going pretty quick
 

231
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,340
been doing it it's going pretty quick
it's just there's so much to do that

232
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,350
it's just there's so much to do that
 

233
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,750
it's just there's so much to do that
it's taking a long time and the other

234
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:12,760
it's taking a long time and the other
 

235
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,820
it's taking a long time and the other
thing I've started to actually place in

236
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,830
thing I've started to actually place in
 

237
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:27,020
thing I've started to actually place in
a song that plays as you ride down and

238

really faster on the boat it's my first
attempt at doing anything really with no

exterior of the storage room this is
kind of just one thing I played around

302
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,150
kind of just one thing I played around
 

303
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,930
kind of just one thing I played around
with using sandstone and having a lining

304
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:04,940
with using sandstone and having a lining
 

305
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,010
with using sandstone and having a lining
at the bottom and around the doors I

you think I should do another is the
thing I was thinking of doing it was

312
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
thing I was thinking of doing it was
 

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,860
thing I was thinking of doing it was
maybe replacing it with the logs instead

314
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:25,870

 

315
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,150

just give me an idea what it would look

316
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160

like

318
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:32,790

 

319
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:44,900

something like that I don't know having

320
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:44,910
something like that I don't know having
 

321
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,040
something like that I don't know having
a hard time deciding

322

the whole wall completely flat like it
 

373
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,510
the whole wall completely flat like it
is if I do something like this I'll make

is if I do something like this I'll make
 

375

is if I do something like this I'll make
I'll put something on it to make it

376
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:24,900
I'll put something on it to make it
 

377
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,630
I'll put something on it to make it
stick out kind of because it looks

stick out kind of because it looks
pretty plain just totally flat as well

380
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,130
pretty plain just totally flat as well
 

381
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,199
pretty plain just totally flat as well
but it's it's a bit of a dilemma for me

382
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:37,209

 

383
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:44,239

Oh No

well I'm sorry guys but it's time I made
 

387
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,179
well I'm sorry guys but it's time I made
sure I was gonna do this when it wasn't

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,230
a subscriber special just so that you
 

391
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,569
a subscriber special just so that you
would know I'm serious

392
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:54,579
would know I'm serious
 

393
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,999
would know I'm serious
I'm not joking around this time it's

394
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:57,009
I'm not joking around this time it's
 

395
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,169
I'm not joking around this time it's
gonna happen and you've been asked me to

396
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:01,179
gonna happen and you've been asked me to
 

397
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,889
gonna happen and you've been asked me to
do this for such a long time now and

398
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:03,899
do this for such a long time now and
 

399
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,859
do this for such a long time now and
it's become an inconvenience so this

400
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:07,869
it's become an inconvenience so this
 

401
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,569
it's become an inconvenience so this
might seem random but I'm finally

402
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:11,579
might seem random but I'm finally
 

403
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,259
might seem random but I'm finally
dealing with the situation I finally

404
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:16,269
dealing with the situation I finally
 

405
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,269
dealing with the situation I finally
made a reliable way to go up and down

406
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:18,279
made a reliable way to go up and down
 

407
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,460
made a reliable way to go up and down
the shaft

408
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,470
the shaft
 

409
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,609
the shaft
so let's look underneath the clay and

410
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:22,619
so let's look underneath the clay and
 

411
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:28,699
so let's look underneath the clay and
this is it I dubbed it the tornado and

412
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:28,709
this is it I dubbed it the tornado and
 

413
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,769
this is it I dubbed it the tornado and
this is actually very similar to

414
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:31,779
this is actually very similar to
 

415
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,249
this is actually very similar to
something I built a long time ago back

of you have motion sickness close your

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,180
of you have motion sickness close your
eyes now i probably should have said

454
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,190
eyes now i probably should have said
 

455
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,470
eyes now i probably should have said
that before and we're at the top just

456
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:55,480
that before and we're at the top just
 

457
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,240
that before and we're at the top just
like that we can write it down using the

458
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,250
like that we can write it down using the
 

459
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,960
like that we can write it down using the
minecart as well but i prefer just

460
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:00,970
minecart as well but i prefer just
 

461
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,470
minecart as well but i prefer just
falling down the middle that's pretty

462
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,480
falling down the middle that's pretty
 

463
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,160
falling down the middle that's pretty
cool

464
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,170
cool
 

465
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:17,610
cool
and we're at the bottom yet so i lined

466
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:17,620
and we're at the bottom yet so i lined
 

467
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,980
and we're at the bottom yet so i lined
the whole outside with sandstone and

468
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:19,990
the whole outside with sandstone and
 

469
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,550
the whole outside with sandstone and
then just wood underneath the tracks

471
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,470

it's pretty simple how I did this is

472
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
it's pretty simple how I did this is
 

473
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,350
it's pretty simple how I did this is
just the three high clearance above each

474
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
just the three high clearance above each
 

475
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,970
just the three high clearance above each
of these tracks so you won't take any

476
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:32,980
of these tracks so you won't take any
 

477
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,880
of these tracks so you won't take any
damage and these power rails are being

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:44,890
powered by a lever I decided to use a
 

481
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,310
powered by a lever I decided to use a
lever instead of redstone torches

lever instead of redstone torches

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,080
lever instead of redstone torches
just because leg is something that I'm

484
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,090
just because leg is something that I'm
 

485
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,700
just because leg is something that I'm
always concerned about and I think

486
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:53,710
always concerned about and I think
 

487
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,530
always concerned about and I think
levers probably laid your game last

488
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:55,540
levers probably laid your game last
 

489
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,870
levers probably laid your game last
because they don't emit any light and

490
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:57,880
because they don't emit any light and
 

491
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,760
because they don't emit any light and
they don't have the particle effects

492
00:16:59,760 --> 00:16:59,770
they don't have the particle effects
 

493
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,760
they don't have the particle effects
that redstone torches have so I'm

494
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:02,770
that redstone torches have so I'm
 

495
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,809
that redstone torches have so I'm
guessing they're probably better for leg

496
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:05,819
guessing they're probably better for leg
 

497
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,610
guessing they're probably better for leg
and I don't like getting rid of redstone

498
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,620
and I don't like getting rid of redstone
 

499
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,189
and I don't like getting rid of redstone
so didn't need to use any for that and

500
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
so didn't need to use any for that and
 

501
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,280
so didn't need to use any for that and
so the minecart is up here if we take

502
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,290
so the minecart is up here if we take
 

503
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,819
so the minecart is up here if we take
the quick way down land on a pressure

504
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:20,829
the quick way down land on a pressure
 

505
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,809
the quick way down land on a pressure
plate which sends a signal all the way

506
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:24,819
plate which sends a signal all the way
 

507
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,900
plate which sends a signal all the way
to the top and it calls our minecart

508
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:27,910
to the top and it calls our minecart
 

509
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,220
to the top and it calls our minecart
down so you can see it coming

510
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,230
down so you can see it coming
 

511
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,380
down so you can see it coming
so it'll always be here waiting for us

512
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,390
so it'll always be here waiting for us
 

513
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:41,920
so it'll always be here waiting for us
to go up which is a nice feature and if

514
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:41,930
to go up which is a nice feature and if
 

515
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:47,140
to go up which is a nice feature and if
we step on it again I made sure to

516
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,150
we step on it again I made sure to
 

517
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,060
we step on it again I made sure to
separate the wires otherwise this will

518
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,070
separate the wires otherwise this will
 

519
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,250
separate the wires otherwise this will
just get sent back up if you pressed it

520
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,260
just get sent back up if you pressed it
 

521
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,890
just get sent back up if you pressed it
again so I'd like it's the tornado

522
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:55,900
again so I'd like it's the tornado
 

523
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,660
again so I'd like it's the tornado
finally have a reliable way of getting

524
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:58,670
finally have a reliable way of getting
 

525
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,210
finally have a reliable way of getting
down here and up here and I'm pretty

526
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,220
down here and up here and I'm pretty
 

527
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,100
down here and up here and I'm pretty
happy and these are just the tracks five

528
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,110
happy and these are just the tracks five
 

529
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,590
happy and these are just the tracks five
by five and in the center is the quick

530
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:14,600
by five and in the center is the quick
 

531
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,090
by five and in the center is the quick
way down and so we can only make it go

532
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,100
way down and so we can only make it go
 

533
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,310
way down and so we can only make it go
up two blocks every every side if it was

534
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
up two blocks every every side if it was
 

535
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,190
up two blocks every every side if it was
six by six we could go up three if it

536
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
six by six we could go up three if it
 

537
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,250
six by six we could go up three if it
was seven by seven go up four but we

538
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,260
was seven by seven go up four but we
 

539
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,330
was seven by seven go up four but we
need to have the corners flat and also

540
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,340
need to have the corners flat and also
 

541
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,290
need to have the corners flat and also
this one here for this to work for the

542
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:38,300
this one here for this to work for the
 

543
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,670
this one here for this to work for the
tracks to connect and yeah that's what's

544
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:42,680
tracks to connect and yeah that's what's
 

545
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,660
tracks to connect and yeah that's what's
underneath the clay now and I'll

546
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:46,670
underneath the clay now and I'll
 

547
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,910
underneath the clay now and I'll
probably do a bit more work around here

548
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:48,920
probably do a bit more work around here
 

549
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,270
probably do a bit more work around here
I think it's fitting because the clay

550
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280
I think it's fitting because the clay
 

551
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,010
I think it's fitting because the clay
always reminded me of a giant storm

552
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,020
always reminded me of a giant storm
 

553
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,900
always reminded me of a giant storm
cloud so underneath it is a tornado

554
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:57,910
cloud so underneath it is a tornado
 

555
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:04,210
cloud so underneath it is a tornado
pretty cool and finally the last major

556
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,220
pretty cool and finally the last major
 

557
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,550
pretty cool and finally the last major
change I've made to my LP world is I

558
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,560
change I've made to my LP world is I
 

559
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,720
change I've made to my LP world is I
built this greenhouse thing for

560
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:09,730
built this greenhouse thing for
 

561
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,110
built this greenhouse thing for
harvesting flowers I'm sure most of you

562
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,120
harvesting flowers I'm sure most of you
 

563
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,050
harvesting flowers I'm sure most of you
have seen this already so I don't need

564
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,060
have seen this already so I don't need
 

565
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,730
have seen this already so I don't need
to go into detail about it you just

566
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:21,740
to go into detail about it you just
 

567
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,630
to go into detail about it you just
stand in the center place water

568
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,640
stand in the center place water
 

569
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,060
stand in the center place water
and it all flows toward you and washes

570
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,070
and it all flows toward you and washes
 

571
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,570
and it all flows toward you and washes
all the items to you which is pretty

572
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:32,580
all the items to you which is pretty
 

573
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,890
all the items to you which is pretty
cool I have been informed that there's

574
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:38,900

 

575
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,750

other green houses that use an exploit

576
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
other green houses that use an exploit
 

577
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,039
other green houses that use an exploit
for automatically harvesting the flowers

578
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:46,049
for automatically harvesting the flowers
 

579
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,789
for automatically harvesting the flowers
in a dark area which I didn't know about

580
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:49,799
in a dark area which I didn't know about
 

581
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,340
in a dark area which I didn't know about
I think in the last day I've seen at

582
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,350
I think in the last day I've seen at
 

583
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,700
I think in the last day I've seen at
least 10 new videos on that since I

584
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:55,710
least 10 new videos on that since I
 

585
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,549
least 10 new videos on that since I
released my greenhouse tutorial so

586
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:01,559
released my greenhouse tutorial so
 

587
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,630
released my greenhouse tutorial so
that's something to keep in mind but I

588
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:05,640
that's something to keep in mind but I
 

589
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,470
that's something to keep in mind but I
do like this design still obviously the

590
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,480
do like this design still obviously the
 

591
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,990
do like this design still obviously the
real jewel of it is the water flow

592
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
real jewel of it is the water flow
 

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,159
real jewel of it is the water flow
patterns I think oops by the way that's

594
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,169
patterns I think oops by the way that's
 

595
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,010
patterns I think oops by the way that's
it's a glitch in the game you can some

596
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020
it's a glitch in the game you can some
 

597
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,360
it's a glitch in the game you can some
how place water unist where that there's

598
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,370
how place water unist where that there's
 

599
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,000
how place water unist where that there's
a ladder and then I don't think you can

600
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,010
a ladder and then I don't think you can
 

601
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,440
a ladder and then I don't think you can
place the ladder in it anymore

602
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,450
place the ladder in it anymore
 

603
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:36,250
place the ladder in it anymore
oh you can't okay never mind Wow very

604
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,260

 

605
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:49,560

strange aerial

606
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,570

 

607
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,629

so I'm thinking of making a mushroom

608
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:51,639
so I'm thinking of making a mushroom
 

609
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:57,629
so I'm thinking of making a mushroom
from somewhat similar to this as I

610
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:57,639
from somewhat similar to this as I
 

611
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,909
from somewhat similar to this as I
really like the water flow patterns and

612
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
really like the water flow patterns and
 

613
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,259
really like the water flow patterns and
the trick of using these signs so I just

614
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:07,269
the trick of using these signs so I just
 

615
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,029
the trick of using these signs so I just
have to modify this a little bit and I

616
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
have to modify this a little bit and I
 

617
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,529
have to modify this a little bit and I
think I can make a mushroom farm out of

618
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:10,539
think I can make a mushroom farm out of
 

619
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:16,109
think I can make a mushroom farm out of
it as well so that's gonna be one of my

620
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:16,119
it as well so that's gonna be one of my
 

621
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:24,269
it as well so that's gonna be one of my
future projects so another thing I plan

622
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:24,279
future projects so another thing I plan
 

623
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,589
future projects so another thing I plan
on doing soon is replacing the wood

624
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:28,599
on doing soon is replacing the wood
 

625
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,549
on doing soon is replacing the wood
underneath these signs with glowstone

626
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:31,559
underneath these signs with glowstone
 

627
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,960
underneath these signs with glowstone
since that patch came out it's now

628
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:33,970
since that patch came out it's now
 

629
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,779
since that patch came out it's now
feasible to do that since a drop more

630
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:36,789
feasible to do that since a drop more
 

631
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:39,299
feasible to do that since a drop more
glowstone and it takes less to craft

632
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:39,309
glowstone and it takes less to craft
 

633
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:45,629
glowstone and it takes less to craft
them craft event seat so yeah it's now

634
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:45,639
them craft event seat so yeah it's now
 

635
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:51,049
them craft event seat so yeah it's now
feasible to do that so I probably will

636
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:51,059

 

637
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,909

unfortunately I harvested most of the

638
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
unfortunately I harvested most of the
 

639
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,799
unfortunately I harvested most of the
easy glowstone so I'll either have to go

640
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:55,809
easy glowstone so I'll either have to go
 

641
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:00,259
easy glowstone so I'll either have to go
