hey everyone this is etho and today we
are playing some more minecraft haven't

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,810
are playing some more minecraft haven't
played minecraft much last few days and

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:17,820
played minecraft much last few days and
 

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,769
played minecraft much last few days and
busy finally you've been able to play a

8
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:21,779
busy finally you've been able to play a
 

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,509
busy finally you've been able to play a
little bit more today I've been working

10
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
little bit more today I've been working
 

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,089
little bit more today I've been working
on that tribute game I've recorded a few

12
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:26,099
on that tribute game I've recorded a few
 

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,800
on that tribute game I've recorded a few
clips of me building it which I might

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,810
clips of me building it which I might
 

15
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,380
clips of me building it which I might
put into making an episode out of I

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,390
put into making an episode out of I
 

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,700
put into making an episode out of I
don't know yet yeah I've been working on

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,710
don't know yet yeah I've been working on
 

19
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,740
don't know yet yeah I've been working on
the tribute game started working on

20
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:36,750
the tribute game started working on
 

21
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,000
the tribute game started working on
something over there

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,010
something over there
 

23
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,770
something over there
today's going to be a bit of a talky

24
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:39,780
today's going to be a bit of a talky
 

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,440
today's going to be a bit of a talky
episode but hopefully we'll start

26
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,450
episode but hopefully we'll start
 

27
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,420
episode but hopefully we'll start
building our hostile mob system to as

28
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,430
building our hostile mob system to as
 

29
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,380
building our hostile mob system to as
we're talking so I brought up the issue

30
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,390
we're talking so I brought up the issue
 

31
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,260
we're talking so I brought up the issue
about the spiders should I build the

32
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,270
about the spiders should I build the
 

33
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,189
about the spiders should I build the
spider only spawning system or not and

34
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:54,199
spider only spawning system or not and
 

35
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,080
spider only spawning system or not and
you mostly you guys seem to agree with

36
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,090
you mostly you guys seem to agree with
 

37
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,229
you mostly you guys seem to agree with
me that it's just not worth the bother

38
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
me that it's just not worth the bother
 

39
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,630
me that it's just not worth the bother
there's just not much benefit to it we

40
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
there's just not much benefit to it we
 

41
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,250
there's just not much benefit to it we
don't need string really we're getting

42
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,260
don't need string really we're getting
 

43
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,130
don't need string really we're getting
plenty of wool it would be nice to have

44
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,140
plenty of wool it would be nice to have
 

45
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,789
plenty of wool it would be nice to have
but well we got two pink wool two pink

46
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
but well we got two pink wool two pink
 

47
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,690
but well we got two pink wool two pink
sheep fell that's mega rare yeah it's

48
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
sheep fell that's mega rare yeah it's
 

49
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,539
sheep fell that's mega rare yeah it's
just not really worth the bother because

50
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:19,549
just not really worth the bother because
 

51
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,890
just not really worth the bother because
we would need to make a very large

52
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
we would need to make a very large
 

53
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,440
we would need to make a very large
spawning system to get a decent rate

54
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,450
spawning system to get a decent rate
 

55
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,070
spawning system to get a decent rate
going and it would be a giant floating

56
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
going and it would be a giant floating
 

57
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,109
going and it would be a giant floating
structure in the sky and you know just

58
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,119
structure in the sky and you know just
 

59
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,340
structure in the sky and you know just
it's a lot of work for such a simple

60
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,350
it's a lot of work for such a simple
 

61
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,149
it's a lot of work for such a simple
thing so we'll skip that we'll be

62
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
thing so we'll skip that we'll be
 

63
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,569
thing so we'll skip that we'll be
building a mob system very similar to

64
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:41,579
building a mob system very similar to
 

65
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,240
building a mob system very similar to
the one I usually build with the 6x6

66
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,250
the one I usually build with the 6x6
 

67
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,440
the one I usually build with the 6x6
spawning pads

68
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,450
spawning pads
 

69
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,749
spawning pads
I'll have a spider option to turn them

70
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
I'll have a spider option to turn them
 

71
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,780
I'll have a spider option to turn them
on or off tall mobs will always be

72
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:50,790
on or off tall mobs will always be
 

73
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,080
on or off tall mobs will always be
spawning

74
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,090
spawning
 

75
00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:00,850
spawning
and I'd also this is what I got built so

76
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:00,860
and I'd also this is what I got built so
 

77
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,980
and I'd also this is what I got built so
far so this cobblestone square I have

78
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:08,990
far so this cobblestone square I have
 

79
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,640
far so this cobblestone square I have
built here is 20 by 20 in size so it's

80
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,650
built here is 20 by 20 in size so it's
 

81
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,949
built here is 20 by 20 in size so it's
divided into four quarters which are ten

82
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
divided into four quarters which are ten
 

83
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,370
divided into four quarters which are ten
by ten each and you can see we have four

84
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:18,380
by ten each and you can see we have four
 

85
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,559
by ten each and you can see we have four
spawning pads in the works here and

86
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:20,569
spawning pads in the works here and
 

87
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,830
spawning pads in the works here and
these are six by six like my normal

88
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
these are six by six like my normal
 

89
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,920
these are six by six like my normal
style and these spaces in between our

90
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,930
style and these spaces in between our
 

91
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,900
style and these spaces in between our
fertile water canals which we need to

92
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:28,910
fertile water canals which we need to
 

93
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,710
fertile water canals which we need to
add yet which will probably do today and

94
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
add yet which will probably do today and
 

95
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,100
add yet which will probably do today and
we're just going to go to sleep at night

96
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,110
we're just going to go to sleep at night
 

97
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,670
we're just going to go to sleep at night
you can see I cut away one of the

98
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
you can see I cut away one of the
 

99
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,610
you can see I cut away one of the
extensions on the passive mob farm it

100
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:42,620
extensions on the passive mob farm it
 

101
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,740
extensions on the passive mob farm it
was in the way so I just decided to get

102
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:47,750
was in the way so I just decided to get
 

103
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,670
was in the way so I just decided to get
rid of it completely because I want this

104
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
rid of it completely because I want this
 

105
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,320
rid of it completely because I want this
Center here to be closer to these E&P

106
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,330
Center here to be closer to these E&P
 

107
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,289
Center here to be closer to these E&P
units as close as possible though

108
00:02:59,289 --> 00:02:59,299
units as close as possible though
 

109
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,039
units as close as possible though
causing any major problems so I cut away

110
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,049
causing any major problems so I cut away
 

111
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,729
causing any major problems so I cut away
that extension we lost fifty spawning

112
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:06,739
that extension we lost fifty spawning
 

113
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,890
that extension we lost fifty spawning
spaces for the passive mob system doing

114
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:08,900
spaces for the passive mob system doing
 

115
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,420
spaces for the passive mob system doing
that too to these diamond pads which we

116
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,430
that too to these diamond pads which we
 

117
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,150
that too to these diamond pads which we
will need to get back some other way

118
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,160
will need to get back some other way
 

119
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,380
will need to get back some other way
what I'm planning on doing eventually

120
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,390
what I'm planning on doing eventually
 

121
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,060
what I'm planning on doing eventually
most likely is to get rid of all these

122
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,070
most likely is to get rid of all these
 

123
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,780
most likely is to get rid of all these
extensions I added and instead have

124
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:22,790
extensions I added and instead have
 

125
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,789
extensions I added and instead have
several layers probably three layers up

126
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:27,799
several layers probably three layers up
 

127
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,069
several layers probably three layers up
with four of these diamond pads each

128
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:30,079
with four of these diamond pads each
 

129
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,170
with four of these diamond pads each
layer and that will help to increase the

130
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,180
layer and that will help to increase the
 

131
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,810
layer and that will help to increase the
efficiency of this thing at the expense

132
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:37,820
efficiency of this thing at the expense
 

133
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:45,250
efficiency of this thing at the expense
of it to being really tall and yeah it

134
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,260
of it to being really tall and yeah it
 

135
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,890
of it to being really tall and yeah it
should reduce the mob traveled the mob

136
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:47,900
should reduce the mob traveled the mob
 

137
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,009
should reduce the mob traveled the mob
travel time if I do that because if a

138
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,019
travel time if I do that because if a
 

139
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,140
travel time if I do that because if a
mob has to travel this extra distance

140
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,150
mob has to travel this extra distance
 

141
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,180
mob has to travel this extra distance
here it takes a lot longer than if they

142
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,190
here it takes a lot longer than if they
 

143
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,039
here it takes a lot longer than if they
only have to traveled this part here so

144
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,049
only have to traveled this part here so
 

145
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,000
only have to traveled this part here so
eventually I'll probably get around to

146
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,010
eventually I'll probably get around to
 

147
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,600
eventually I'll probably get around to
doing that

148
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:01,610
doing that
 

149
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,490
doing that
and with this new mob system I'm

150
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:03,500
and with this new mob system I'm
 

151
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,020
and with this new mob system I'm
building I'm going to be doing much the

152
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,030
building I'm going to be doing much the
 

153
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,050
building I'm going to be doing much the
same thing or

154
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,060
same thing or
 

155
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,229
same thing or
going to be stacking these layers I'm

156
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,239
going to be stacking these layers I'm
 

157
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,020
going to be stacking these layers I'm
thinking at least four layers with four

158
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,030
thinking at least four layers with four
 

159
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,780
thinking at least four layers with four
pads each one on top of each other is

160
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:16,790
pads each one on top of each other is
 

161
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,500
pads each one on top of each other is
the plan and we should maybe get to

162
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,510
the plan and we should maybe get to
 

163
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,600
the plan and we should maybe get to
building it so I decide to do another

164
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:26,610
building it so I decide to do another
 

165
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,340
building it so I decide to do another
one of these fast forward things you can

166
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,350
one of these fast forward things you can
 

167
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,830
one of these fast forward things you can
watch me fumble through building my mob

168
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:30,840
watch me fumble through building my mob
 

169
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,290
watch me fumble through building my mob
system here the first layer I'm just

170
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:33,300
system here the first layer I'm just
 

171
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,940
system here the first layer I'm just
going to build the first layer and then

172
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:34,950
going to build the first layer and then
 

173
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,390
going to build the first layer and then
we'll test it out if it works good will

174
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
we'll test it out if it works good will
 

175
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,370
we'll test it out if it works good will
I'll probably build the other three or

176
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,380
I'll probably build the other three or
 

177
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,350
I'll probably build the other three or
four layers off-camera if it works good

178
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
four layers off-camera if it works good
 

179
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,180
four layers off-camera if it works good
if it doesn't we'll have to figure

180
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,190
if it doesn't we'll have to figure
 

181
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,610
if it doesn't we'll have to figure
something else so but I think it should

182
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:46,620
something else so but I think it should
 

183
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,879
something else so but I think it should
be okay and as you watch me build this I

184
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:49,889
be okay and as you watch me build this I
 

185
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,290
be okay and as you watch me build this I
thought it might be cool to talk about

186
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,300
thought it might be cool to talk about
 

187
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,969
thought it might be cool to talk about
something that's on everybody's mind

of that first thing I want to point out

208
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:21,720
of that first thing I want to point out
 

209
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,170

be coming out in a day or two from what
 

213

I saw of the livestream I would be very

214
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:29,760
I saw of the livestream I would be very
 

215
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,730
I saw of the livestream I would be very
surprised if it does they have lots of

216
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:31,740
surprised if it does they have lots of
 

217
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,219
surprised if it does they have lots of
work to do on it yet lots of features

218
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:34,229
work to do on it yet lots of features
 

219
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,120
work to do on it yet lots of features
aren't complete such as villages I did

220
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,130
aren't complete such as villages I did
 

221
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,100
aren't complete such as villages I did
not see any NPCs or anything like that

222
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,110
not see any NPCs or anything like that
 

223
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,060
not see any NPCs or anything like that
and they were having other problems with

224
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,070
and they were having other problems with
 

225
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,900
and they were having other problems with
implementing villages so I wouldn't

226
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:46,910
implementing villages so I wouldn't
 

227
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,680
implementing villages so I wouldn't
expect anything soon actually it it

228
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,690
expect anything soon actually it it
 

229
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,060
expect anything soon actually it it
sounded like they were going to do two

230
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,070
sounded like they were going to do two
 

231
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,719
sounded like they were going to do two
patches instead of one big patch so

232
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:56,729
patches instead of one big patch so
 

233
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,490
patches instead of one big patch so
they'll probably release a few patch or

234
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
they'll probably release a few patch or
 

235
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
they'll probably release a few patch or
a few features soon like in a week or

236
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,510
a few features soon like in a week or
 

237
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,680
a few features soon like in a week or
two and then as they work on its more

238
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:03,690
two and then as they work on its more
 

239
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,629
two and then as they work on its more
they'll release a bunch of other stuff

240
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
they'll release a bunch of other stuff
 

241
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,909
they'll release a bunch of other stuff
and I'm guessing they'll put villages

242
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
and I'm guessing they'll put villages
 

243
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,510
and I'm guessing they'll put villages
off for later some other cool things

244
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
off for later some other cool things
 

245
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,420
off for later some other cool things
that came out are these new dungeons

246
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,430
that came out are these new dungeons
 

247
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,490
that came out are these new dungeons
there's like abandoned mine shafts

248
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,500
there's like abandoned mine shafts
 

249
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,140
there's like abandoned mine shafts
stuff like that there's new biomes

250
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,150
stuff like that there's new biomes
 

251
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,379
stuff like that there's new biomes
existing biomes can be bigger now so we

252
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:22,389
existing biomes can be bigger now so we
 

253
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,870
existing biomes can be bigger now so we
can have huge oceans huge deserts stuff

254
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
can have huge oceans huge deserts stuff
 

255
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
can have huge oceans huge deserts stuff
like that and of course there's an

256
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,570
like that and of course there's an
 

257
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,390
like that and of course there's an
experience system that was added which

258
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
experience system that was added which
 

259
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,450
experience system that was added which
at the moment isn't complete it doesn't

260
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:33,460
at the moment isn't complete it doesn't
 

261
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,210
at the moment isn't complete it doesn't
do anything I'm guessing they'll make it

262
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,220
do anything I'm guessing they'll make it
 

263
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,640
do anything I'm guessing they'll make it
like maybe you can mine faster as you

264
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:38,650
like maybe you can mine faster as you
 

265
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,040
like maybe you can mine faster as you
gain more experience input skills into

266
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,050
gain more experience input skills into
 

267
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,070
gain more experience input skills into
mining or farming or something like that

268
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
mining or farming or something like that
 

269
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,719
mining or farming or something like that
I don't know we'll see what happens I'm

270
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:45,729
I don't know we'll see what happens I'm
 

271
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:50,250
I don't know we'll see what happens I'm
just guessing and what else

272
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,260
just guessing and what else
 

273
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,620
just guessing and what else
big thing people keep pointing out to me

274
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:52,630
big thing people keep pointing out to me
 

275
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,260
big thing people keep pointing out to me
is the Enderman they're worried they're

276
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,270
is the Enderman they're worried they're
 

277
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:02,129
is the Enderman they're worried they're
gonna mess up my world here um Enderman

278
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:02,139
gonna mess up my world here um Enderman
 

279
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,210
gonna mess up my world here um Enderman
what should I say about them well in the

280
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,220
what should I say about them well in the
 

281
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,250
what should I say about them well in the
videos I saw they are three blocks high

282
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,260
videos I saw they are three blocks high
 

283
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,219
videos I saw they are three blocks high
this mob system I'm building here is

284
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:11,229
this mob system I'm building here is
 

285
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,200
this mob system I'm building here is
going to be cheap excuse me it's going

286
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,210
going to be cheap excuse me it's going
 

287
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,750
going to be cheap excuse me it's going
to be three blocks high so that they can

288
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:15,760
to be three blocks high so that they can
 

289
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,270
to be three blocks high so that they can
hopefully spawn in it we don't know the

290
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,280
hopefully spawn in it we don't know the
 

291
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,370
hopefully spawn in it we don't know the
exact details of how they'll work yet so

292
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,380
exact details of how they'll work yet so
 

293
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,360
exact details of how they'll work yet so
everything I'm doing here is kind of

294
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,370
everything I'm doing here is kind of
 

295
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,110
everything I'm doing here is kind of
guesswork if they are a problem like

296
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
guesswork if they are a problem like
 

297
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,150
guesswork if they are a problem like
they at the moment they can move random

298
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
they at the moment they can move random
 

299
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,600
they at the moment they can move random
blocks they become a problem I can

300
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,610
blocks they become a problem I can
 

301
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,879
blocks they become a problem I can
always put lower the ceiling in this mob

302
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:35,889
always put lower the ceiling in this mob
 

303
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,580
always put lower the ceiling in this mob
system so it's only to high and that way

304
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,590
system so it's only to high and that way
 

305
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,879
system so it's only to high and that way
they probably won't be able to spawn but

306
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:41,889
they probably won't be able to spawn but
 

307
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,800
they probably won't be able to spawn but
if they do spawn there their heads will

308
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:43,810
if they do spawn there their heads will
 

309
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,210
if they do spawn there their heads will
be in the ceiling and they'll suffocate

310
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,220
be in the ceiling and they'll suffocate
 

311
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,990
be in the ceiling and they'll suffocate
I'm hoping so if they're an issue that's

312
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm hoping so if they're an issue that's
 

313
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,740
I'm hoping so if they're an issue that's
what I can do

314
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:49,750
what I can do
 

315
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,040
what I can do
I doubt notch will make them so that

316
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,050
I doubt notch will make them so that
 

317
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,279
I doubt notch will make them so that
they can destroy the world without you

318
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:56,289
they can destroy the world without you
 

319
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,760
they can destroy the world without you

things like villages and that won't

392
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,230
things like villages and that won't
 

393
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,950
things like villages and that won't
appear in my game the new biomes won't

394
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:45,960
appear in my game the new biomes won't
 

395
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,230
appear in my game the new biomes won't
appear in my game and less I explore

396
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
appear in my game and less I explore
 

397
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,900
appear in my game and less I explore
further and if I explore further than I

398
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:50,910
further and if I explore further than I
 

399
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,090

believe those things will randomly

400
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,100
believe those things will randomly
 

401
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,920
believe those things will randomly
generate just like they normally do so I

402
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:56,930
generate just like they normally do so I
 

403
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,050
generate just like they normally do so I
will probably keep this LP world I don't

404
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,060
will probably keep this LP world I don't
 

405
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,480
will probably keep this LP world I don't
think I'll build a new one or start a

406
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,490
think I'll build a new one or start a
 

407
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,990
think I'll build a new one or start a
new LP world so shouldn't be a problem

408
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
new LP world so shouldn't be a problem
 

409
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,320
new LP world so shouldn't be a problem
I'm not too worried about it

410
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,330

 

411
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,860

yeah there's rivers and the rivers they

412
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:15,870
yeah there's rivers and the rivers they
 

413
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,770
yeah there's rivers and the rivers they
look pretty nice and some of them will

414
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:18,780
look pretty nice and some of them will
 

415
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,000
look pretty nice and some of them will
have like porches be deep in the ground

416
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,010
have like porches be deep in the ground
 

417
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,800
have like porches be deep in the ground
um of course the combat was improved we

418
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:27,810
um of course the combat was improved we
 

419
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,860
um of course the combat was improved we
have critical hits now mobs will take

420
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:30,870
have critical hits now mobs will take
 

421
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,450
have critical hits now mobs will take
more damage if you hit them when you're

422
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:32,460
more damage if you hit them when you're
 

423
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,230
more damage if you hit them when you're
jumping and we have the new bow which

424
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
jumping and we have the new bow which
 

425
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,980
jumping and we have the new bow which
can shoot short medium and far shots

426
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:39,990
can shoot short medium and far shots
 

427
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,770
can shoot short medium and far shots
I think the far shots do more damage but

428
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:42,780
I think the far shots do more damage but
 

429
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,850
I think the far shots do more damage but
they take longer

430
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:43,860
they take longer
 

431
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,710
they take longer
charge up that should be cool and of

432
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
charge up that should be cool and of
 

433
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
charge up that should be cool and of
course the one thing I'm really

434
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,570
course the one thing I'm really
 

435
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,079
course the one thing I'm really
interested in is the sprinting you can -

436
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,089
interested in is the sprinting you can -
 

437
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,780
interested in is the sprinting you can -
now by double-tapping forward and when

438
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:56,790
now by double-tapping forward and when
 

439
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,690
now by double-tapping forward and when
you're dashing and you hit a mob they'll

440
00:10:59,690 --> 00:10:59,700
you're dashing and you hit a mob they'll
 

441
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,360
you're dashing and you hit a mob they'll
get knocked back further so that would

442
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,370
get knocked back further so that would
 

443
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,420
get knocked back further so that would
be pretty cool sound like not just going

444
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,430
be pretty cool sound like not just going
 

445
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,019
be pretty cool sound like not just going
to make it use up your hunger meter if

446
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:09,029
to make it use up your hunger meter if
 

447
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,650
to make it use up your hunger meter if
you're dashing so if you have lots of

448
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:12,660
you're dashing so if you have lots of
 

449
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,230
you're dashing so if you have lots of
meat like me you might be able to - for

450
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,240
meat like me you might be able to - for
 

451
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,430
meat like me you might be able to - for
long periods of time and that sounds

452
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,440
long periods of time and that sounds
 

453
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,319
long periods of time and that sounds
that you could be fun good way of

454
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:21,329
that you could be fun good way of
 

455
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,579
that you could be fun good way of
getting around quicker a new lighting

456
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:25,589
getting around quicker a new lighting
 

457
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,430
getting around quicker a new lighting

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,550
you can see it's dark in there
pitch black I saw it all the ice all the

482
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
pitch black I saw it all the ice all the
 

483
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,500
pitch black I saw it all the ice all the
water all the water canals are fixed

484
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,510
water all the water canals are fixed
 

485
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,890
water all the water canals are fixed
here it's three high like I said and

486
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:38,900
here it's three high like I said and
 

487
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:45,700
here it's three high like I said and
yeah should be good so let's let's head

488
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:45,710
yeah should be good so let's let's head
 

489
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,190
yeah should be good so let's let's head
down to ground level and you will see it

490
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,200
down to ground level and you will see it
 

491
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,600
down to ground level and you will see it
in action there it is that's what it

492
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,610
in action there it is that's what it
 

493
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,810
in action there it is that's what it
looks like from below not the prettiest

494
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:58,820
looks like from below not the prettiest
 

495
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,350
looks like from below not the prettiest
thing but in time we'll try make it look

496
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,360
thing but in time we'll try make it look
 

497
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,710
thing but in time we'll try make it look
better function comes first though in my

498
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
better function comes first though in my
 

499
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,010
better function comes first though in my
LP so we shall see it working now let's

500
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,020
LP so we shall see it working now let's
 

501
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,580
LP so we shall see it working now let's
switch the easy three mom's up there now

502
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,590
switch the easy three mom's up there now
 

503
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:24,949
switch the easy three mom's up there now
for moms five

504
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959

 

505
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,299

six seven eight not too impressive

506
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:30,309
six seven eight not too impressive
 

507
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,719
six seven eight not too impressive
spawning rates at the moment and see

508
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:33,729
spawning rates at the moment and see
 

509
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,199
spawning rates at the moment and see
their spiders they get through it fairly

510
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:37,209
their spiders they get through it fairly
 

511
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:46,639
their spiders they get through it fairly
decent oh nice try

512
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:46,649

 

513
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:56,119

yeah so your basic mob system it works

514
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,129

 

515
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,829

so the reason the spawning rates aren't

516
00:13:58,829 --> 00:13:58,839
so the reason the spawning rates aren't
 

517
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,619
so the reason the spawning rates aren't
very good at the moment is one we only

518
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:01,629
very good at the moment is one we only
 

519
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:03,509
very good at the moment is one we only
have four pads they're not a whole lot

520
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
have four pads they're not a whole lot
 

521
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,489
have four pads they're not a whole lot
of spawning space as I make more layers

522
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:07,499
of spawning space as I make more layers
 

523
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,439
of spawning space as I make more layers
the rates will increase but the main

524
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:10,449
the rates will increase but the main
 

525
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,739
the rates will increase but the main
reason I haven't lit up a whole lot of

526
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:13,749
reason I haven't lit up a whole lot of
 

527
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,529
reason I haven't lit up a whole lot of
caves in this area

528
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:15,539
caves in this area
 

529
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,279
caves in this area
like what like might be able to see some

530
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:20,289
like what like might be able to see some
 

531
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:26,549
like what like might be able to see some
mobs through the ice here below I can

532
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:26,559
mobs through the ice here below I can
 

533
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,969
mobs through the ice here below I can
see I didn't see a few down there it's

534
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:29,979
see I didn't see a few down there it's
 

535
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:33,779
see I didn't see a few down there it's
another one they're far down deep so I

536
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:33,789
another one they're far down deep so I
 

537
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,309
another one they're far down deep so I
got a lot of teams to light up around

538
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:35,319
got a lot of teams to light up around
 

539
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,439
got a lot of teams to light up around
here and when I do that then the rates

540
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:37,449
here and when I do that then the rates
 

541
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:41,219
here and when I do that then the rates
will dramatically increase but I was

542
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:41,229
will dramatically increase but I was
 

543
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,389
will dramatically increase but I was
actually surprised they're as good as

544
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
actually surprised they're as good as
 

545
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,769
actually surprised they're as good as
they are right now and it does what I

546
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:49,779
they are right now and it does what I
 

547
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,429
they are right now and it does what I
wanted it to do so there's one thing I

548
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:53,439
wanted it to do so there's one thing I
 

549
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,099
wanted it to do so there's one thing I
want to test yet the spider spawning

550
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:56,109
want to test yet the spider spawning
 

551
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:59,729
want to test yet the spider spawning
option my plan for it so let's head back

552
00:14:59,729 --> 00:14:59,739
option my plan for it so let's head back
 

553
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,949
option my plan for it so let's head back
up there and I will show you how that's

554
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:01,959
up there and I will show you how that's
 

555
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,199
up there and I will show you how that's
going to work right so you may have been

556
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:07,209
going to work right so you may have been
 

557
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,689
going to work right so you may have been
wondering what's the deal with all these

558
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:09,699
wondering what's the deal with all these
 

559
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,699
wondering what's the deal with all these
holes what are they for why did I put

560
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:11,709
holes what are they for why did I put
 

561
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,169
holes what are they for why did I put
them in all I'll tell you now they're my

562
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:16,179
them in all I'll tell you now they're my
 

563
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,279
them in all I'll tell you now they're my
idea for a spider spawning option to

564
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:20,289
idea for a spider spawning option to
 

565
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,229
idea for a spider spawning option to
turn the spider spawning on or off and

566
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:22,239
turn the spider spawning on or off and
 

567
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,479
turn the spider spawning on or off and
they're also part of a lighting system

568
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:24,489
they're also part of a lighting system
 

569
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:28,219
they're also part of a lighting system
idea I had so you can see I have four

570
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:28,229
idea I had so you can see I have four
 

571
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:32,500
idea I had so you can see I have four
water blocks in here in these holes

572
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:32,510
water blocks in here in these holes
 

573
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,439
water blocks in here in these holes
and down below it looks like this so the

574
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:38,449
and down below it looks like this so the
 

575
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,090
and down below it looks like this so the
idea is tall mobs should be able to

576
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,100
idea is tall mobs should be able to
 

577
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,650
idea is tall mobs should be able to
spawn on any of these blocks but spiders

578
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:43,660
spawn on any of these blocks but spiders
 

579
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,480
spawn on any of these blocks but spiders
they need a three by three space around

580
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,490
they need a three by three space around
 

581
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,639
they need a three by three space around
the block chosen for them to spawn so if

582
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:48,649
the block chosen for them to spawn so if
 

583
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,710
the block chosen for them to spawn so if
they spawn on this block here they'll

584
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
they spawn on this block here they'll
 

585
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,710
they spawn on this block here they'll
need they'll check a space like this and

586
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
need they'll check a space like this and
 

587
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,410
need they'll check a space like this and
where the water block is here and since

588
00:15:59,410 --> 00:15:59,420
where the water block is here and since
 

589
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,160
where the water block is here and since
there's a water block here I'm hoping

590
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,170
there's a water block here I'm hoping
 

591
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,360
there's a water block here I'm hoping
it'll decide that they're not allowed to

592
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,370
it'll decide that they're not allowed to
 

593
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,759
it'll decide that they're not allowed to
spawn there and that'll disable them

594
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:06,769
spawn there and that'll disable them
 

595
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,269
spawn there and that'll disable them
from spawning is what I'm hoping in my

596
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:10,279
from spawning is what I'm hoping in my
 

597
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,970
from spawning is what I'm hoping in my
old system I use tap slabs to do this so

598
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:12,980
old system I use tap slabs to do this so
 

599
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,629
old system I use tap slabs to do this so
if water works we'll be able to just

600
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
if water works we'll be able to just
 

601
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,620
if water works we'll be able to just
have water and lava piston controlled at

602
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:20,630
have water and lava piston controlled at
 

603
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,460
have water and lava piston controlled at
the top of this tower and if we want to

604
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,470
the top of this tower and if we want to
 

605
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,889
the top of this tower and if we want to
shut off mob spawning will allow the lab

606
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:29,899
shut off mob spawning will allow the lab
 

607
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,960
shut off mob spawning will allow the lab
to flow down all these holes every

608
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:31,970
to flow down all these holes every
 

609
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,660
to flow down all these holes every
spawning pad will have these holes in

610
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:34,670
spawning pad will have these holes in
 

611
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,059
spawning pad will have these holes in
them that water alive we can flow down

612
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:37,069
them that water alive we can flow down
 

613
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:40,389
them that water alive we can flow down
freely lava flows down and light up the

614
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
freely lava flows down and light up the
 

615
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,490
freely lava flows down and light up the
area mob shouldn't be able to spawn then

616
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:42,500
area mob shouldn't be able to spawn then
 

617
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,150
area mob shouldn't be able to spawn then
if we have water flowing down now date

618
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
if we have water flowing down now date
 

619
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,439
if we have water flowing down now date
oops

620
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:49,449
oops
 

621
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,670
oops
water slowing down I'm hoping it'll

622
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
water slowing down I'm hoping it'll
 

623
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,590
water slowing down I'm hoping it'll
prevent spiders from spawning so I'm

624
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
prevent spiders from spawning so I'm
 

625
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,569
prevent spiders from spawning so I'm
going to fill all these up with water

626
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:55,579
going to fill all these up with water
 

627
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,050
going to fill all these up with water
and cover them and then we'll see if it

628
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,060
and cover them and then we'll see if it
 

629
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,540
and cover them and then we'll see if it
works or not and really hoping it does

630
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,550
works or not and really hoping it does
 

631
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,370
works or not and really hoping it does
otherwise I got to rethink everything

632
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:03,380
otherwise I got to rethink everything
 

633
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:10,150
otherwise I got to rethink everything
here I've been watching this thing for a

634
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
here I've been watching this thing for a
 

635
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,799
here I've been watching this thing for a
few minutes now I have not seen any

636
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:11,809
few minutes now I have not seen any
 

637
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,189
few minutes now I have not seen any
spiders spawn since I put the water in

638
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:14,199
spiders spawn since I put the water in
 

639
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,280
spiders spawn since I put the water in
which is great that means it's working

640
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,290
which is great that means it's working
 

641
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,880
which is great that means it's working
I'm pretty sure I should have seen a

642
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:21,890
I'm pretty sure I should have seen a
 

643
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,010
I'm pretty sure I should have seen a
spider by now if it wasn't so yeah

644
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,020
spider by now if it wasn't so yeah
 

645
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,220
spider by now if it wasn't so yeah
that'll work great as a spider option

646
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,230
that'll work great as a spider option
 

647
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,560
that'll work great as a spider option
takes very little space I don't have a

648
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:32,570
takes very little space I don't have a
 

649
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,810
takes very little space I don't have a
huge mass of wiring or anything like

650
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:34,820
huge mass of wiring or anything like
 

651
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,049
huge mass of wiring or anything like
that and it works with this vertical

652
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:38,059
that and it works with this vertical
 

653
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,450
that and it works with this vertical
style of spawning system this tower

654
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,460
style of spawning system this tower
 

655
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,930

656
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:43,940

 

657
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,820

yeah I'll be great I want to try out the

658
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:46,830
yeah I'll be great I want to try out the
 

659
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,830
yeah I'll be great I want to try out the
lighting now see how long it takes lava

660
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
lighting now see how long it takes lava
 

661
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,860
lighting now see how long it takes lava
to disappear and stuff like that

662
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:51,870
to disappear and stuff like that
 

663
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,260
to disappear and stuff like that
what happens if water flows down as the

664
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,270
what happens if water flows down as the
 

665
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,080
what happens if water flows down as the
lab is disappearing things like that we

666
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,090
lab is disappearing things like that we
 

667
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,730
lab is disappearing things like that we
should figure out so let's head back up

668
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:01,740
should figure out so let's head back up
 

669
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,510
should figure out so let's head back up
there

670
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,520

 

671
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,680

I believe I'm only going to need about

672
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:12,690
I believe I'm only going to need about
 

673
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,610
I believe I'm only going to need about
four or eight lava sources to light up

674
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,620
four or eight lava sources to light up
 

675
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,070
four or eight lava sources to light up
this whole system so that's very

676
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,080
this whole system so that's very
 

677
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,950
this whole system so that's very
efficient and probably four or eight

678
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:21,960
efficient and probably four or eight
 

679
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,800
efficient and probably four or eight
Pistons to control it so should be good

680
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:26,810
Pistons to control it so should be good
 

681
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,090
Pistons to control it so should be good
let's try put live in these holes cover

682
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,100
let's try put live in these holes cover
 

683
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,740
let's try put live in these holes cover
them just to make sure daylight's not

684
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:33,750
them just to make sure daylight's not
 

685
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,860
them just to make sure daylight's not
interfering with the lighting and head

686
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:36,870
interfering with the lighting and head
 

687
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:47,180
interfering with the lighting and head
down through our spot here let's see is

688
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,190
down through our spot here let's see is
 

689
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,960
down through our spot here let's see is
that enough

690
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:47,970
that enough
 

691
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,010
that enough
lava oops so that block there is light

692
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,020
lava oops so that block there is light
 

693
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,040
lava oops so that block there is light
level 15 this will be fourteen thirteen

694
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,050
level 15 this will be fourteen thirteen
 

695
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,000
level 15 this will be fourteen thirteen
twelve eleven ten

696
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,010
twelve eleven ten
 

697
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,740
twelve eleven ten
so each pad we can probably get away

698
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:03,750
so each pad we can probably get away
 

699
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,190
so each pad we can probably get away
with the just two lava columns like this

700
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
with the just two lava columns like this
 

701
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,180
with the just two lava columns like this
diagonally from each other we need more

702
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,190
diagonally from each other we need more
 

703
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:18,500
diagonally from each other we need more
than one because one two three four this

704
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,510
than one because one two three four this
 

705
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,250
than one because one two three four this
would be fourteen thirteen twelve eleven

706
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,260
would be fourteen thirteen twelve eleven
 

707
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,180
would be fourteen thirteen twelve eleven
ten nine eight seven mobs can spawn at

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,190
ten nine eight seven mobs can spawn at
 

709
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,760
ten nine eight seven mobs can spawn at
light level seven so it's just not quite

710
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:28,770
light level seven so it's just not quite
 

711
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,630
light level seven so it's just not quite
enough with only one lava stream so

712
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
enough with only one lava stream so
 

713
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,800
enough with only one lava stream so
that's how the lighting will work no

714
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:36,810
that's how the lighting will work no
 

715
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,570
that's how the lighting will work no
mobs will be able to spawn in here if

716
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,580
mobs will be able to spawn in here if
 

717
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,390
mobs will be able to spawn in here if
it's lit up like this that's how we can

718
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
it's lit up like this that's how we can
 

719
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,790
it's lit up like this that's how we can
shut it down should be good let's head

720
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:43,800
shut it down should be good let's head
 

721
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,900
shut it down should be good let's head
back up this is the same type of

722
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:47,910
back up this is the same type of
 

723
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,730
back up this is the same type of
lighting system I was planning on using

724
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:49,740
lighting system I was planning on using
 

725
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,130
lighting system I was planning on using
in my spider only spawning system that

726
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,140
in my spider only spawning system that
 

727
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,870
in my spider only spawning system that
is building a couple days ago that

728
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:53,880
is building a couple days ago that
 

729
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,230
is building a couple days ago that
failed

730
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,240
failed
 

731
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,840
failed
and in the comments I saw a lot of

732
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:57,850
and in the comments I saw a lot of
 

733
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,590
and in the comments I saw a lot of
people were concerned that the lab would

734
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
people were concerned that the lab would
 

735
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,650
people were concerned that the lab would
disappear too slowly in the style so we

736
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:04,660
disappear too slowly in the style so we
 

737
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,640
disappear too slowly in the style so we
should check it out

738
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:05,650
should check it out
 

739
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,350
should check it out
because you know when you're caving

740
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
because you know when you're caving
 

741
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,800
because you know when you're caving
sometimes and you destroy lab a source

742
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:10,810
sometimes and you destroy lab a source
 

743
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,350
sometimes and you destroy lab a source
block sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes

744
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
block sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes
 

745
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,510
block sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes
for the lava to disappear so I

746
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
for the lava to disappear so I
 

747
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
for the lava to disappear so I
understand why people brought that up

748
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:17,850
understand why people brought that up
 

749
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,730
understand why people brought that up
but with this vertical columns I don't

750
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:20,740
but with this vertical columns I don't
 

751
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,870
but with this vertical columns I don't
think it takes that long yeah look how

752
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
think it takes that long yeah look how
 

753
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,570
think it takes that long yeah look how
fast it goes away takes time yes but at

754
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,580
fast it goes away takes time yes but at
 

755
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:39,570
fast it goes away takes time yes but at
the longest I would say

756
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:39,580

 

757
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:47,570

can't remember how fast lava travels

758
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:47,580

 

759
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,130

looks like one block every three or four

760
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,140
looks like one block every three or four
 

761
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,820
looks like one block every three or four
seconds anyway so it won't take too long

762
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:55,830

 

763
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,930

the other thing I'm wondering about is

764
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:57,940
the other thing I'm wondering about is
 

765
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,020
the other thing I'm wondering about is
what happens if you were to switch it

766
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,030
what happens if you were to switch it
 

767
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,200
what happens if you were to switch it
quickly like if you who had the lighting

768
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,210
quickly like if you who had the lighting
 

769
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,510
quickly like if you who had the lighting
system on and then you shut it off and

770
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:06,520
system on and then you shut it off and
 

771
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,060
system on and then you shut it off and
turned on the spider option shut off

772
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,070
turned on the spider option shut off
 

773
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,360
turned on the spider option shut off
spider spawning so lab would disappear

774
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,370
spider spawning so lab would disappear
 

775
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,860
spider spawning so lab would disappear
and then you would dump water down the

776
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:16,870
and then you would dump water down the
 

777
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,660
and then you would dump water down the
hole so let's try that out and remove

778
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:21,670
hole so let's try that out and remove
 

779
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,970
hole so let's try that out and remove
this and quickly put water in and see if

780
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:23,980
this and quickly put water in and see if
 

781
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,990
this and quickly put water in and see if
it makes cobblestone

782
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000

 

783
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,370

no no cobblestone that's interesting as

784
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:37,380
no no cobblestone that's interesting as
 

785
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,090
no no cobblestone that's interesting as
kind of expecting it to I guess it

786
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,100
kind of expecting it to I guess it
 

787
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:51,590
kind of expecting it to I guess it
doesn't when it's vertical like that now

788
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
doesn't when it's vertical like that now
 

789
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,950
doesn't when it's vertical like that now
I have never made a cobblestone

790
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
I have never made a cobblestone
 

791
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:05,110
I have never made a cobblestone
generator

792
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120

 

793
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,379

yeah so that won't be a problem cool one

794
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:09,389
yeah so that won't be a problem cool one
 

795
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:16,129
yeah so that won't be a problem cool one
less thing to worry about so I'm pretty

796
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:16,139
less thing to worry about so I'm pretty
 

797
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,930
less thing to worry about so I'm pretty
happy with this design I think it turned

798
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:17,940
happy with this design I think it turned
 

799
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,480
happy with this design I think it turned
out okay I'm going to work you're

800
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,490
out okay I'm going to work you're
 

801
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,310
out okay I'm going to work you're
finishing it up add three or four more

802
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
finishing it up add three or four more
 

803
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
finishing it up add three or four more
layers to it it'll probably take me an

804
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:23,850
layers to it it'll probably take me an
 

805
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,620
layers to it it'll probably take me an
hour to to do that and that will

806
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:27,630
hour to to do that and that will
 

807
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,379
hour to to do that and that will
increase the spawning rates but the best

808
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:30,389
increase the spawning rates but the best
 

809
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:31,909
increase the spawning rates but the best
way of doing that of course is to light

810
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
way of doing that of course is to light
 

811
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,299
way of doing that of course is to light
up the Teves within this area and then

812
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:35,309
up the Teves within this area and then
 

813
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,889
up the Teves within this area and then
spawning rates will continue to increase

814
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:36,899
spawning rates will continue to increase
 

815
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:48,580
spawning rates will continue to increase
but it's working fairly decent I'm happy

816
