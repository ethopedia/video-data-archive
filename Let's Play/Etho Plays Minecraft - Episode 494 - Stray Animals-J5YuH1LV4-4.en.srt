00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
mountains all of a sudden and then like
 

43
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,899
mountains all of a sudden and then like
six hours after deciding that we were

44
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:08,909
six hours after deciding that we were
 

45
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,460
six hours after deciding that we were
leaving to go to the mountains the Rocky

46
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:10,470
leaving to go to the mountains the Rocky
 

47
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,980
leaving to go to the mountains the Rocky
Mountains so I just got back from that

48
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:12,990
Mountains so I just got back from that
 

49
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,190
Mountains so I just got back from that

52
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
today and now it is time to get back
 

53
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,590
today and now it is time to get back
into some sort of routine here hopefully

54
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:20,600
into some sort of routine here hopefully
 

55
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,289
into some sort of routine here hopefully
so let's let's get back to it here um so

56
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,299
so let's let's get back to it here um so
 

57
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,060
so let's let's get back to it here um so
I built this thing it's trying to make a

58
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,070
I built this thing it's trying to make a
 

59
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,770
I built this thing it's trying to make a
launcher to get up to our tunnel there

60
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:30,780
launcher to get up to our tunnel there
 

61
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,410
launcher to get up to our tunnel there
and I'm having quite a bit of trouble

62
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,420
and I'm having quite a bit of trouble
 

63
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,300
and I'm having quite a bit of trouble
with it because it's inconsistent right

64
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,310
with it because it's inconsistent right
 

65
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,609
with it because it's inconsistent right
let you go slow that goes up before you

66
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619
let you go slow that goes up before you
 

67
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,350
let you go slow that goes up before you
go over top it so I wanted to see maybe

68
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
go over top it so I wanted to see maybe
 

69
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,060
go over top it so I wanted to see maybe
we can do it a little bit smarter like

70
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,070
we can do it a little bit smarter like
 

71
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,249
we can do it a little bit smarter like
try to make it so this pressure plate

72
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:46,259
try to make it so this pressure plate
 

73
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,990
try to make it so this pressure plate
and this pressure plate both have to be

74
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
and this pressure plate both have to be
 

75
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,690
and this pressure plate both have to be
down so that like the boat is centered

76
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:50,700
down so that like the boat is centered
 

77
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,719
down so that like the boat is centered
like in the middle there before it tries

78
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:53,729
like in the middle there before it tries
 

79
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,550
like in the middle there before it tries
to launch because right now it's like if

80
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
to launch because right now it's like if
 

81
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,260
to launch because right now it's like if
either of these get stepped on it gets

82
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,270
either of these get stepped on it gets
 

83
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,539
either of these get stepped on it gets
launched which is not good it doesn't

84
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:02,549
launched which is not good it doesn't
 

85
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,029
launched which is not good it doesn't
really land does it

86
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:05,039
really land does it
 

87
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,680
really land does it
it's gotta be a visual glitch I think if

88
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,690
it's gotta be a visual glitch I think if
 

89
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,309
it's gotta be a visual glitch I think if
I stand here yeah I land on my head then

90
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
I stand here yeah I land on my head then
 

91
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,229
I stand here yeah I land on my head then
okay so I tried something here I kind of

92
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,239
okay so I tried something here I kind of
 

93
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,570
okay so I tried something here I kind of
added in an and D so when both of these

94
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:17,580
added in an and D so when both of these
 

95
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,070
added in an and D so when both of these
are down see like if we just step on one

96
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
are down see like if we just step on one
 

97
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,570
are down see like if we just step on one
or the other doesn't work but they both

98
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,580
or the other doesn't work but they both
 

99
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,170
or the other doesn't work but they both
have to be down and then that goes up

100
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,180
have to be down and then that goes up
 

101
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,080
have to be down and then that goes up
right turns out though that doesn't

102
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,090
right turns out though that doesn't
 

103
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,640
right turns out though that doesn't
really work because the and E is just

104
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:31,650
really work because the and E is just
 

105
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,470
really work because the and E is just
too slow and I don't think there's any

106
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,480
too slow and I don't think there's any
 

107
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,949
too slow and I don't think there's any
way to speed it up so it's like if we're

108
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
way to speed it up so it's like if we're
 

109
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,300
way to speed it up so it's like if we're
going slow it works just great

110
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,310
going slow it works just great
 

111
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,780
going slow it works just great
look at that perfect but if we get any

112
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:44,790
look at that perfect but if we get any
 

113
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,030
look at that perfect but if we get any
speed go and then it's not going to work

114
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
speed go and then it's not going to work
 

115
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,080
speed go and then it's not going to work
so good see it went up but we were we

116
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,090
so good see it went up but we were we
 

117
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,190
so good see it went up but we were we
were long gone by then

118
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
were long gone by then
 

119
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,350
were long gone by then

single-player pressure plates go on the

122
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:56,760
single-player pressure plates go on the
 

123
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,400
single-player pressure plates go on the
left and the right like this if you're

124
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,410
left and the right like this if you're
 

125
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,670
left and the right like this if you're
playing multiplayer if you want this to

126
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
playing multiplayer if you want this to
 

127
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,780
playing multiplayer if you want this to
activate you got to put the pressure

128
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:02,790
activate you got to put the pressure
 

129
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,380
activate you got to put the pressure
plate here because that one extra block

130
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,390
plate here because that one extra block
 

131
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,180

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,650
boat travel time before it gets over
here helps to deal with the leg on the

00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:14,489
server while in single-player that's not
 

139
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,530
server while in single-player that's not
really a problem and it's kind of hit

140
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:18,540
really a problem and it's kind of hit
 

141
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,000
really a problem and it's kind of hit
and miss on a server in single-player

142
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,010
and miss on a server in single-player
 

143
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,920
and miss on a server in single-player
this I think over just about every time

144
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:21,930
this I think over just about every time
 

145
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,800
this I think over just about every time
though but I'm having one more problem

146
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:24,810
though but I'm having one more problem
 

147
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,500
though but I'm having one more problem
let's get like some some real distance

148
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,510
let's get like some some real distance
 

149
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,660
let's get like some some real distance
here just to make sure we don't skim

150
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,670
here just to make sure we don't skim
 

151
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,229
here just to make sure we don't skim
over top it that's full speed no problem

152
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:35,239
over top it that's full speed no problem
 

153
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,069
over top it that's full speed no problem
which is pretty cool the problem we're

154
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:40,079
which is pretty cool the problem we're
 

155
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,699
which is pretty cool the problem we're
having now is a lot of the time let's go

156
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:43,709
having now is a lot of the time let's go
 

157
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,420
having now is a lot of the time let's go
a little bit slower here a lot of the

158
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,430
a little bit slower here a lot of the
 

159
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,229
a little bit slower here a lot of the
time we hit our head you see that like

160
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
time we hit our head you see that like
 

161
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,819
time we hit our head you see that like
we hit our head going over top this

162

we hit our head going over top this
 

163
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,699
we hit our head going over top this
thing and you see that like weird just

00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:05,639
we're still hitting our head okay okay
 

173
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,640

more thing curling AHA we are also the

218
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:18,169
more thing curling AHA we are also the

do this right and they're wheel aha so I
 

223
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,269
do this right and they're wheel aha so I
made this weird device here where it

brings the boat to a dead stop it falls

226
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,409
brings the boat to a dead stop it falls
 

227
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,969
brings the boat to a dead stop it falls
down there and then shoots it up and

228
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:36,979
down there and then shoots it up and
 

229
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,129
down there and then shoots it up and
then shoots it sideways I figured out

230
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:39,139
then shoots it sideways I figured out
 

231
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,909
then shoots it sideways I figured out
this is max height you need for slime

232
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:42,919
this is max height you need for slime

blocks up like this this one at the very
 

235
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:50,890
blocks up like this this one at the very
top is what actually shoot sideways with

236
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:50,900
top is what actually shoot sideways with
 

237
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,050
top is what actually shoot sideways with
a one tick one pick pulse so it goes up

238
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,060
a one tick one pick pulse so it goes up
 

239
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,550
a one tick one pick pulse so it goes up
and then one tick later goes sideways

240
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,560
and then one tick later goes sideways
 

241
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,209
and then one tick later goes sideways
and you need four blocks with this if

242
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:01,219
and you need four blocks with this if

first time whoa all right well I kind of

264
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,040
first time whoa all right well I kind of
 

265
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,290
first time whoa all right well I kind of
kind of realized this is going to be

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,300
kind of realized this is going to be
 

267
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,890
kind of realized this is going to be
hard to find a perfect solution to so

268
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:53,900
hard to find a perfect solution to so
 

269
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,660
hard to find a perfect solution to so
this is what I decided to do just keep

270
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,670
this is what I decided to do just keep
 

271
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,790
this is what I decided to do just keep
it simple I put it right at the end here

so if you fail the first time you'll

274
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,040
so if you fail the first time you'll
 

275
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,990
so if you fail the first time you'll
land back on it anyways and whoa

276
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,000
land back on it anyways and whoa

land back on it anyways and whoa

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,630
it'll work the first time and then when
we go back because it's right at the end

terracotta as it's called now I'll
probably continue calling it hardened

318
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:38,500
probably continue calling it hardened
 

319
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,560
probably continue calling it hardened

so I did the the triple track thing if

332
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
so I did the the triple track thing if
 

333
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,740
so I did the the triple track thing if
you don't know why I do this is just to

334
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:01,750
you don't know why I do this is just to
 

335
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,430
you don't know why I do this is just to
prevent mobs from spawning on the ice

336
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,440
prevent mobs from spawning on the ice
 

337
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,490
prevent mobs from spawning on the ice
which is really really annoying if it

338
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:08,500
which is really really annoying if it
 

339
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,160
which is really really annoying if it
does happen there's a reason I don't use

340
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,170

 

341
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:20,010

normal ice isn't there maybe not maybe I

342
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,020
normal ice isn't there maybe not maybe I
 

343
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,890
normal ice isn't there maybe not maybe I
should switch over I kind of feel like I

344
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:22,900
should switch over I kind of feel like I
 

345
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,660
should switch over I kind of feel like I
had a reason for not using it before and

346
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,670
had a reason for not using it before and
 

347
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,350
had a reason for not using it before and
now I'm questioning it mm-hmm

348
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,360
now I'm questioning it mm-hmm
 

349
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,930
now I'm questioning it mm-hmm

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,190
out of the nether finally let's do one
 

383
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,670
out of the nether finally let's do one
one boat trip back up here and just see

384
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
one boat trip back up here and just see
 

385
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,160
one boat trip back up here and just see
there we get lucky and it goes if it

386
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,170
there we get lucky and it goes if it
 

387
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,560
there we get lucky and it goes if it
works the first time here ah yeah then

388
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,570
works the first time here ah yeah then
 

389
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,390
works the first time here ah yeah then
we go over here I still got a triple

390
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,400
we go over here I still got a triple
 

391
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,110
we go over here I still got a triple
track this stuff why don't I use regular

392
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
track this stuff why don't I use regular
 

393
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
track this stuff why don't I use regular
ice

394
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,130
ice
 

395
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,560
ice
and really thinking about I do like how

396
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,570
and really thinking about I do like how
 

397
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,509
and really thinking about I do like how
the pack dice looks more but when you

398
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:36,519
the pack dice looks more but when you
 

399
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,120
the pack dice looks more but when you
put the tracks on doesn't look as good

400
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,130
put the tracks on doesn't look as good
 

401
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,389
put the tracks on doesn't look as good
anymore because like over here I did the

402
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
anymore because like over here I did the
 

403
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,030
anymore because like over here I did the
triple track thing as well hmm yeah

404
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,040
triple track thing as well hmm yeah
 

405
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,980
triple track thing as well hmm yeah
because I'm pretty sure regular I still

406
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:49,990
because I'm pretty sure regular I still
 

407
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,590
because I'm pretty sure regular I still
doesn't spawn mobs right so we wouldn't

408
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,600
doesn't spawn mobs right so we wouldn't
 

409
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,829
doesn't spawn mobs right so we wouldn't
have to put the tracks on top which

410
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
have to put the tracks on top which
 

411
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,259
have to put the tracks on top which
would be nice it would probably look

412
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:58,269
would be nice it would probably look
 

413
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,750
would be nice it would probably look
better but I was thinking about it we

414
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:00,760
better but I was thinking about it we
 

415
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,960
better but I was thinking about it we
got to worry about the ice melting if we

416
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:03,970
got to worry about the ice melting if we
 

417
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,670
got to worry about the ice melting if we
use regular ice we also have to worry

418
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
use regular ice we also have to worry
 

419
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,220
use regular ice we also have to worry
about like what's underneath the ice I'd

420
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,230
about like what's underneath the ice I'd
 

421
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,100
about like what's underneath the ice I'd
have to place more blocks because you'd

422
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,110
have to place more blocks because you'd
 

423
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,199
have to place more blocks because you'd
be able to see through this and like if

424
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:13,209
be able to see through this and like if
 

425
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,360
be able to see through this and like if
there's netherrack on the other side of

426
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,370
there's netherrack on the other side of
 

427
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,490
there's netherrack on the other side of
the ice it's not going to look good so

428
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:17,500
the ice it's not going to look good so
 

429
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,930
the ice it's not going to look good so
it's more work to do that and also a

430
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:20,940
it's more work to do that and also a
 

431
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,870
it's more work to do that and also a
couple other things here I think like in

432
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
couple other things here I think like in
 

433
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,670
couple other things here I think like in
this case for example a zombie pigmen

434
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:26,680
this case for example a zombie pigmen
 

435
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,850
this case for example a zombie pigmen
could spawn here and he won't walk over

436
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:29,860
could spawn here and he won't walk over
 

437
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,290
could spawn here and he won't walk over
here because they don't walk on tracks

438
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:31,300
here because they don't walk on tracks
 

439
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,360
here because they don't walk on tracks
but if this was regular ice they would

440
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,370
but if this was regular ice they would
 

441
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,760
but if this was regular ice they would
watch here so yeah maybe Pat dice is

442
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:38,770
watch here so yeah maybe Pat dice is
 

443
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,480
watch here so yeah maybe Pat dice is
still better okay I tell you what guys

444
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,490
still better okay I tell you what guys
 

445
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,250
still better okay I tell you what guys
we're going to do some investigating

446
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,260
we're going to do some investigating
 

447

00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
can actually spawn mobs it's pretty rare
 

459
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,290

let's play here you might have noticed
like we have wolves and we got cats all

476
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,520
like we have wolves and we got cats all
 

477
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,880
like we have wolves and we got cats all
over the place kind of randomly and I've

478
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:26,890
over the place kind of randomly and I've
 

479
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,259
over the place kind of randomly and I've
never really explained why they're

480
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:31,269
never really explained why they're
 

481
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,840
never really explained why they're
coming from the mob system so our mob

482
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:33,850
coming from the mob system so our mob
 

483
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,699
coming from the mob system so our mob
system uses wolves to scare skeletons

484
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:38,709
system uses wolves to scare skeletons
 

485
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,449
system uses wolves to scare skeletons
uses cats to spear creepers and some our

486
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:42,459
uses cats to spear creepers and some our
 

487
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,950
uses cats to spear creepers and some our
villagers to trap

488
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:43,960
villagers to trap
 

489
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,980
villagers to trap
zombies right I think over here we got

490
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:46,990
zombies right I think over here we got
 

491
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,950
zombies right I think over here we got
got on the roof here I did try to

492
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:49,960
got on the roof here I did try to
 

493
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,090
got on the roof here I did try to
replace all the wolves in and cats once

494
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,100
replace all the wolves in and cats once
 

495
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,590
replace all the wolves in and cats once
let's look inside and to see how many

496
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
let's look inside and to see how many
 

497
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,780
let's look inside and to see how many
are left so if I take damage near this

498
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:57,790
are left so if I take damage near this
 

499
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,780
are left so if I take damage near this
thing like within 32 blocks of one of

500
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:00,790
thing like within 32 blocks of one of
 

501
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,430
thing like within 32 blocks of one of
the animals I think they'll teleport

502
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,440
the animals I think they'll teleport
 

503
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,250
the animals I think they'll teleport
outs looks like we've got some activity

504
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,260
outs looks like we've got some activity
 

505
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,250
outs looks like we've got some activity
in there and you notice those creepers

506
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,260
in there and you notice those creepers
 

507
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,920
in there and you notice those creepers
aren't running they should be running

508
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:09,930
aren't running they should be running
 

509
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,930
aren't running they should be running
but I bet you the cats gone that was

510
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:12,940
but I bet you the cats gone that was
 

511
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:20,790
but I bet you the cats gone that was
over there yeah okay okay so that's not

512
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
over there yeah okay okay so that's not
 

513
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,080
over there yeah okay okay so that's not
going to work get them around the corner

514
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,090
going to work get them around the corner
 

515
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,250
going to work get them around the corner
yeah I don't really want them to blow up

516
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,260
yeah I don't really want them to blow up
 

517
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,010
yeah I don't really want them to blow up
here okay there was three right maybe

518
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,020
here okay there was three right maybe
 

519
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,320
here okay there was three right maybe
you walked over so before we had both

520
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,330
you walked over so before we had both
 

521
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,210
you walked over so before we had both
these spots so there would be I think a

522
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,220
these spots so there would be I think a
 

523
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,360
these spots so there would be I think a
cat down here and a wolf up here on both

524
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,370
cat down here and a wolf up here on both
 

525
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,920
cat down here and a wolf up here on both
sides wolf a wolf bottom cap top okay on

526
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:46,930
sides wolf a wolf bottom cap top okay on
 

527
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,570
sides wolf a wolf bottom cap top okay on
all the layers here's another one I've

528
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:51,580
all the layers here's another one I've
 

529
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,340
all the layers here's another one I've
been waiting a long time here for them

530
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,350
been waiting a long time here for them
 

531
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,210
been waiting a long time here for them
all fall down sorry I think we're going

532
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,220
all fall down sorry I think we're going
 

533
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,630
all fall down sorry I think we're going
to go oh okay ain't quite get them all

534
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:03,640
to go oh okay ain't quite get them all
 

535
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,910
to go oh okay ain't quite get them all
so it looks like second layer missing

536
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
so it looks like second layer missing
 

537
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,740
so it looks like second layer missing
animals there and and here as well so

538
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:10,750
animals there and and here as well so
 

539
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,270
animals there and and here as well so
this layer is like totally messed up

540
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,280
this layer is like totally messed up
 

541
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,600
this layer is like totally messed up
it's gone this mob system used to be

542
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,610
it's gone this mob system used to be
 

543
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,640
it's gone this mob system used to be
very effective actually and now I've

544
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:17,650
very effective actually and now I've
 

545
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,860
very effective actually and now I've
noticed it's slowed down quite a bit

546
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:19,870
noticed it's slowed down quite a bit
 

547
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,130
noticed it's slowed down quite a bit
because all the animals are gone we got

548
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,140
because all the animals are gone we got
 

549
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,920
because all the animals are gone we got
a cat there Oh

550
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:24,930
a cat there Oh
 

551
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,660
a cat there Oh
Skelton he's gone okay and this side we

552
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:30,670
Skelton he's gone okay and this side we
 

553
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:41,220
Skelton he's gone okay and this side we
got nothing and woke alright another

554
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,230
got nothing and woke alright another
 

555
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,720
got nothing and woke alright another
layer looks like they're all gone

556
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:42,730
layer looks like they're all gone
 

557
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,370
layer looks like they're all gone
so yeah it's it's looking bad they need

558
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,380
so yeah it's it's looking bad they need
 

559
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,620
so yeah it's it's looking bad they need
to be replaced again in the patch notes

560
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:46,630
to be replaced again in the patch notes
 

561
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,770
to be replaced again in the patch notes
I saw they don't teleport if you put

562
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:49,780
I saw they don't teleport if you put
 

563
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,050
I saw they don't teleport if you put
them in mine cards now which is how I

564
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,060
them in mine cards now which is how I
 

565
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,430
them in mine cards now which is how I
originally did this but they did

566
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
originally did this but they did
 

567
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,460
originally did this but they did
teleport out of the mine carts and would

568
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,470
teleport out of the mine carts and would
 

569
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,060
teleport out of the mine carts and would
eventually kill themselves

570
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,070
eventually kill themselves
 

571
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,530
eventually kill themselves
see oh we still have a minecart they're

572
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:01,540
see oh we still have a minecart they're
 

573
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,560
see oh we still have a minecart they're
actually with tracks okay I did a bad

574
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,570
actually with tracks okay I did a bad
 

575
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,780
actually with tracks okay I did a bad
job of finishing this then I guess I

576
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:09,790
job of finishing this then I guess I
 

577
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,180
job of finishing this then I guess I
missed this all right guys so we got

578
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,190
missed this all right guys so we got
 

579
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,460
missed this all right guys so we got
three wolves here one in a minecart and

580
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,470
three wolves here one in a minecart and
 

581
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,800
three wolves here one in a minecart and
then these two I just have sitting down

582
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:19,810
then these two I just have sitting down
 

583
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,770
then these two I just have sitting down
there all tamed wolves in the past if I

584
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:22,780
there all tamed wolves in the past if I
 

585
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,950
there all tamed wolves in the past if I
would shoot myself near these guys they

586
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:25,960
would shoot myself near these guys they
 

587
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
would shoot myself near these guys they
would all teleport to me the only

588
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,370
would all teleport to me the only
 

589
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,010
would all teleport to me the only
difference is the one in the minecart

590
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,020
difference is the one in the minecart
 

591
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,540
difference is the one in the minecart
would then teleport back into the

592
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:30,550
would then teleport back into the
 

593
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,910
would then teleport back into the
minecart so we would quickly teleport to

594
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:32,920
minecart so we would quickly teleport to
 

595
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
minecart so we would quickly teleport to
me then and then back within like one

596
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:34,930
me then and then back within like one
 

597
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,950
me then and then back within like one
one frame problem is like if you're near

598
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:37,960
one frame problem is like if you're near
 

599
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,290
one frame problem is like if you're near
lava or blocks sometimes they would

600
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:40,300
lava or blocks sometimes they would
 

601
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,420
lava or blocks sometimes they would
suffocate or catch on fire and then they

602
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:42,430
suffocate or catch on fire and then they
 

603
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,970
suffocate or catch on fire and then they
would just die even though they they

604
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:44,980
would just die even though they they
 

605
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,430
would just die even though they they
were in a mine cards these guys they

606
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
were in a mine cards these guys they
 

607
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,560
were in a mine cards these guys they
would teleport or they they'd sit up if

608
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,570
would teleport or they they'd sit up if
 

609
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,870
would teleport or they they'd sit up if
you would get shot in here them let's

610
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:51,880
you would get shot in here them let's
 

611
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,850
you would get shot in here them let's
just see what happens now okay so like I

612
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:56,860
just see what happens now okay so like I
 

613
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,830
just see what happens now okay so like I
got it so even though they were sitting

614
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:58,840
got it so even though they were sitting
 

615
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,010
got it so even though they were sitting
down they sat up that's not good this

616
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,020
down they sat up that's not good this
 

617
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,630
down they sat up that's not good this
guy I didn't notice him dude he

618
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:03,640
guy I didn't notice him dude he
 

619
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,670
guy I didn't notice him dude he
teleports I don't think you did

620
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
teleports I don't think you did
 

621
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,260
teleports I don't think you did
which is what they supposed to be fixed

622
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,270
which is what they supposed to be fixed
 

623
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,410
which is what they supposed to be fixed
I think we're good like every one of

624
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,420
I think we're good like every one of
 

625
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,640
I think we're good like every one of
those shots you would teleport to me

626
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:17,650
those shots you would teleport to me
 

627
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,650
those shots you would teleport to me
before so I think if we put them in mine

628
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:19,660
before so I think if we put them in mine
 

629
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,600
before so I think if we put them in mine
carts in our mob system they'll be fine

630
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:21,610
carts in our mob system they'll be fine
 

631
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,090
carts in our mob system they'll be fine
now so I think for today we're just

632
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,100

right now goes up to the windmill and
 

713
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,330
right now goes up to the windmill and
and that's it a dead ends but it

714

connects right up to the man cave so

720
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
connects right up to the man cave so
 

721
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,430
connects right up to the man cave so
it's about two three hundred blocks long

722
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,440
it's about two three hundred blocks long
 

723
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,549
it's about two three hundred blocks long
right now we want to extend it we want

that area wrap it around up to the Nexus

730
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:00,679
that area wrap it around up to the Nexus
 

731
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,460
that area wrap it around up to the Nexus
and super smelter area there so we'll

732
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,470
and super smelter area there so we'll
 

733
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,490
and super smelter area there so we'll
see what we can do with it and the way I

734
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:06,500
see what we can do with it and the way I
 

735
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,380
see what we can do with it and the way I
do my path is pretty simple I just like

736
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,390
do my path is pretty simple I just like
 

737
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,150

run with the shovel and see what happens

738
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:13,160
run with the shovel and see what happens
 

739
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,780
run with the shovel and see what happens
and I try not to make it straight

740
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:16,790
and I try not to make it straight
 

741
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,510
and I try not to make it straight
and then I just fill it in with gravel

742
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
and then I just fill it in with gravel
 

743
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,160
and then I just fill it in with gravel
and then I go again with like

744
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,170
and then I go again with like
 

745
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,320
and then I go again with like
cobblestone and andesite with this path

746
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,330
cobblestone and andesite with this path
 

747
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,580
cobblestone and andesite with this path
okay so I'm expecting we're going to

748
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:27,590
okay so I'm expecting we're going to
 

749
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,860
okay so I'm expecting we're going to
want to build this up maybe although

750
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:29,870
want to build this up maybe although
 

751
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,400

this is like down here right
 

753
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,470
this is like down here right
maybe maybe we lower it and then build

754
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:35,480
maybe maybe we lower it and then build
 

755
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,590
maybe maybe we lower it and then build
like some kind of cool wall on this side

756
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
like some kind of cool wall on this side
 

757

not enough room for this stuff in the
 

771
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,030
not enough room for this stuff in the
the Nexus so it's kind of stayed here

772
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,040
the Nexus so it's kind of stayed here
 

773
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,450

789
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,500
the aerial view right now it is looking
not super defined over there it's pretty

790
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,510
not super defined over there it's pretty
 

791
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,040
not super defined over there it's pretty
good though

792
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,050
good though
 

793
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,760
good though
so I think I'll start filling in here

794
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:41,770

 

795
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,350

okay so let's check out the first pass

796
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,360
okay so let's check out the first pass
 

797
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,100
okay so let's check out the first pass
here see what it's like and it's a good

798
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,110
here see what it's like and it's a good
 

799
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,120
here see what it's like and it's a good
angle that's okay I like how this curves

800
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,130
angle that's okay I like how this curves
 

801
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,780
angle that's okay I like how this curves
a little little curve around the hill

802
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:55,790
a little little curve around the hill
 

803
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,440
a little little curve around the hill
there it's good see how it goes like

804
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,450
there it's good see how it goes like
 

805
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,060
there it's good see how it goes like
that that's I think that's good that's

806
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,070
that that's I think that's good that's
 

807
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,890
that that's I think that's good that's
natural this part might be a bit too

808
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:02,900
natural this part might be a bit too
 

809
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,210
natural this part might be a bit too
straight here but I like this curve over

810
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,220
straight here but I like this curve over
 

811
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,120
straight here but I like this curve over
here I think that's good yeah it looks

812
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,130
here I think that's good yeah it looks
 

813
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,590
here I think that's good yeah it looks
kind of straight doesn't it maybe I

814
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
kind of straight doesn't it maybe I
 

815
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,780
kind of straight doesn't it maybe I
should end up add a bend in somewhere

816
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:13,790
should end up add a bend in somewhere
 

817
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,110
should end up add a bend in somewhere
there okay very good very good

818
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
there okay very good very good
 

819
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
there okay very good very good
so this is our alternate path I'm going

820
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,370
so this is our alternate path I'm going
 

821
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,370
so this is our alternate path I'm going
to change the side back to grass I think

822
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:21,380
to change the side back to grass I think
 

823
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,780
to change the side back to grass I think
and then we'll we'll use this one

824
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:22,790
and then we'll we'll use this one
 

825
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,740
and then we'll we'll use this one
instead let's look from a distance here

826
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:25,750
instead let's look from a distance here
 

827
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,960
instead let's look from a distance here
always good to get a distance viewpoints

828
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:28,970
always good to get a distance viewpoints
 

829
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,910
always good to get a distance viewpoints
so before I was going to stray

830
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:30,920
so before I was going to stray
 

831
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,680
so before I was going to stray
through now can I have a bend in it and

832
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:32,690
through now can I have a bend in it and
 

833
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,990
through now can I have a bend in it and
hopefully that would look better mm-hmm

834
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,000
hopefully that would look better mm-hmm
 

835
