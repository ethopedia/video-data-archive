fire much faster oh yeah how to do this
 

193
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:37,460
fire much faster oh yeah how to do this
this is a lot easier with a better tree

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,970
I don't know why but I love doing this I
probably did this to five trees already

248
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:53,980

 

249
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,880

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,230
been getting lots of resources so I
 

265
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,590
been getting lots of resources so I
should be able to start building some

266
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:48,600
should be able to start building some
 

267
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,160
should be able to start building some
bigger things now I've got a fair bit of

268
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,170
bigger things now I've got a fair bit of
 

269
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,910
bigger things now I've got a fair bit of
redstone iron and getting lots of gold

270
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:57,920
redstone iron and getting lots of gold
 

271
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,470
redstone iron and getting lots of gold
we got lava if we need it and I'll just

272
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,480
we got lava if we need it and I'll just
 

273
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,070
we got lava if we need it and I'll just
show you how much I got cleared out

274
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,080

 

275
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,480

quite a bit um while I was working down

276
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,490
quite a bit um while I was working down
 

277
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,150
quite a bit um while I was working down
here I kept hearing like skeletons and

278
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,160
here I kept hearing like skeletons and
 

279
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,360
here I kept hearing like skeletons and
stuff so I dug up and discovered a bunch

280
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,370
stuff so I dug up and discovered a bunch
 

281
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,450
stuff so I dug up and discovered a bunch
of cave systems I'll show you these next

282
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:26,460
of cave systems I'll show you these next
 

283
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:34,880
of cave systems I'll show you these next
episode and yeah so I kept finding like

284
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:34,890
episode and yeah so I kept finding like
 

285
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,440
episode and yeah so I kept finding like
these pools of water which I found

286
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,450
these pools of water which I found
 

287
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,419
these pools of water which I found
strange and then I remembered not

288
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:41,429
strange and then I remembered not
 

289
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,990
strange and then I remembered not
chatted that feature the maps now and

290
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,000
chatted that feature the maps now and
 

291
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,419
chatted that feature the maps now and
this is the first map I've generated

292
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:47,429
this is the first map I've generated
 

293
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,680
this is the first map I've generated
that has it so I thought it was pretty

294
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:51,690
that has it so I thought it was pretty
 

295
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,910
that has it so I thought it was pretty
cool and then I realized something

296
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:54,920
cool and then I realized something
 

297
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,100
cool and then I realized something
terrible these are placed randomly

298
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,110
terrible these are placed randomly
 

299
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,590
terrible these are placed randomly
throughout the map I found one that goes

300
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:06,600
throughout the map I found one that goes
 

301
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,529
throughout the map I found one that goes
down

302
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:11,539

 

303
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,849

past where the bedrock should be which

304
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:15,859
past where the bedrock should be which
 

305
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,330
past where the bedrock should be which
means I have been I was dealing that all

306
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:19,340
means I have been I was dealing that all
 

307
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,849
means I have been I was dealing that all
out way above the lava level which is

308
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:24,859
out way above the lava level which is
 

309
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:30,190
out way above the lava level which is
actually where this is where I actually

310
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,200
actually where this is where I actually
 

311
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,129
actually where this is where I actually
should have been digging and this is

312
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:33,139
should have been digging and this is
 

313
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:34,330
should have been digging and this is
where I've been doing all the redstone

314
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,340
where I've been doing all the redstone
 

315
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,899
where I've been doing all the redstone
up there I wasn't getting any redstone

316
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:36,909
up there I wasn't getting any redstone
 

317
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,049
up there I wasn't getting any redstone
or

318
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:38,059
or
 

319
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:44,859
or
any diamonds or anything so kind of kind

320
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:44,869
any diamonds or anything so kind of kind
 

321
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,320
any diamonds or anything so kind of kind
of made a mistake but I'll just join the

322
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,330
of made a mistake but I'll just join the
 

323
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,820
of made a mistake but I'll just join the
two layers and it'll work fine and this

324
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:51,830
two layers and it'll work fine and this
 

325
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,259
two layers and it'll work fine and this
is gonna be the main layer though this

326
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:53,269
is gonna be the main layer though this
 

327
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:54,820
is gonna be the main layer though this
is well cheap data this is where I'm

328
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:54,830
is well cheap data this is where I'm
 

329
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,749
is well cheap data this is where I'm
gonna keep digging and I did find some

330
00:20:58,749 --> 00:20:58,759
gonna keep digging and I did find some
 

331
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:05,229
gonna keep digging and I did find some
diamonds first ones and I'll probably

332
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:05,239
diamonds first ones and I'll probably
 

333
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:11,279
diamonds first ones and I'll probably
start digging out some canals and yeah

334
