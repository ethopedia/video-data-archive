so this was like a solid mountain before
 

71
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,730
so this was like a solid mountain before
now we just have a thin wafer at the top

72
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:05,740
now we just have a thin wafer at the top
 

73
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,669
now we just have a thin wafer at the top
there that's pretty good ITT's not

74
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:08,679
there that's pretty good ITT's not
 

75
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,550

place a bunch of tnt for it to really be
 

85
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,210
place a bunch of tnt for it to really be
effective or it's really good for

86
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,220
effective or it's really good for

the beds are actually bouncy now you can
 

101
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,240
the beds are actually bouncy now you can
bounce on the bed you see that little

all right this is a long shot whoa don't

106
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,489
all right this is a long shot whoa don't
 

107
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,160

00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:03,459
fool we're trying to test things here
 

111
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,629

okay this is this one's bouncy yeah one

112
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:09,639
okay this is this one's bouncy yeah one
 

113
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,400
okay this is this one's bouncy yeah one
second okay so now if you drop an anvil

114
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,410
second okay so now if you drop an anvil
 

115
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,360
second okay so now if you drop an anvil
on it I doubt it'll bounce

116
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
on it I doubt it'll bounce
 

117
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,650
on it I doubt it'll bounce
yeah just breaks okay we're probably

118
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:19,660
yeah just breaks okay we're probably
 

119
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,150
yeah just breaks okay we're probably
high enough right yeah the bed just

120
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,160
high enough right yeah the bed just
 

121
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,199
high enough right yeah the bed just
disappears okay so let's let's jump

122
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,209
disappears okay so let's let's jump
 

123
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:32,120
disappears okay so let's let's jump
let's see what happens now woo hoo Oh

124
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,130

 

125
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,979

interesting okay so we took we took fall

126
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:34,989
interesting okay so we took we took fall
 

127
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,120
interesting okay so we took we took fall
damage two hearts with our feather

128
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,130
damage two hearts with our feather
 

129
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,400
damage two hearts with our feather
falling on but we did bounce pretty good

130
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,410
falling on but we did bounce pretty good
 

131
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:48,089
falling on but we did bounce pretty good
too 17 18 19 20 21 22 we should probably

132
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:48,099
too 17 18 19 20 21 22 we should probably
 

133
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,120
too 17 18 19 20 21 22 we should probably
stop there so we lose half a heart for

134
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,130
stop there so we lose half a heart for
 

135
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,410
stop there so we lose half a heart for
every block we drop with no armor on

136
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,420
every block we drop with no armor on
 

137
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,230
every block we drop with no armor on
but it takes three bucks for us to

138
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,240
but it takes three bucks for us to
 

139
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,760
but it takes three bucks for us to
initial yet going so we should have like

140
00:03:59,760 --> 00:03:59,770
initial yet going so we should have like
 

141
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,700
initial yet going so we should have like
half a heart left right I'm wondering if

142
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:02,710
half a heart left right I'm wondering if
 

143
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,560
half a heart left right I'm wondering if
the damage dampens our fall kind of like

144
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,570
the damage dampens our fall kind of like
 

145
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:12,810
the damage dampens our fall kind of like
the hay bales do but it's been a while

146
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:12,820
the hay bales do but it's been a while
 

147
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,340
the hay bales do but it's been a while
since I've done like falling tests so I

148
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,350
since I've done like falling tests so I
 

149
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,470
since I've done like falling tests so I
just might not know what's wet anymore

150
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:16,480
just might not know what's wet anymore
 

151
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,620
just might not know what's wet anymore
yeah let's try it without the bed now do

152
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,630
yeah let's try it without the bed now do
 

153
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,040
yeah let's try it without the bed now do
some proper science here you know with

154
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,050
some proper science here you know with
 

155
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,420
some proper science here you know with
and without okay now if we fall again so

156
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,430
and without okay now if we fall again so
 

157
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,390
and without okay now if we fall again so
we got down to four four Hertz down and

158
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
we got down to four four Hertz down and
 

159
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,090
we got down to four four Hertz down and
half heart okay so it does dampen the

160
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,100
half heart okay so it does dampen the
 

161
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,850
half heart okay so it does dampen the
fall kind of like hay bales okay so I

162
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:35,860
fall kind of like hay bales okay so I
 

163
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,440
fall kind of like hay bales okay so I
did a little bit of mining here you see

164
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,450
did a little bit of mining here you see
 

165
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,180
did a little bit of mining here you see
we got some flat spots now set up a

166
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,190
we got some flat spots now set up a
 

167
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,670
we got some flat spots now set up a
beacon with speed mining all that kind

168
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
beacon with speed mining all that kind
 

169
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,350
beacon with speed mining all that kind
of stuff went and got some hay bales and

170
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
of stuff went and got some hay bales and
 

171
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,890
of stuff went and got some hay bales and
now let's try these out no armor on it

172
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:46,900
now let's try these out no armor on it
 

173
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,010
now let's try these out no armor on it
goes down to hearts so that was four

174
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,020
goes down to hearts so that was four
 

175
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:17,910
goes down to hearts so that was four
hearts down this is two hearts down so

176
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:17,920
hearts down this is two hearts down so
 

177
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,100
hearts down this is two hearts down so
check it out everybody we're about to

178
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,110
check it out everybody we're about to
 

179
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,990
check it out everybody we're about to
pack up and go do some other stuff here

180
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
pack up and go do some other stuff here
 

181
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,180
pack up and go do some other stuff here
but that's not which farm and I just

182
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,190
but that's not which farm and I just
 

183
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,920
but that's not which farm and I just
want to show you what we've mined and

184
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:25,930
want to show you what we've mined and
 

185
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,170
want to show you what we've mined and
what we got left to mine here it's

186
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,180
what we got left to mine here it's
 

187
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,430
what we got left to mine here it's
actually pretty easy to see it now that

188
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
actually pretty easy to see it now that
 

189
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,180
actually pretty easy to see it now that
I've cut out this section so this is one

190
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,190
I've cut out this section so this is one
 

191
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,860
I've cut out this section so this is one
of our corners and there's a dividing

192
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:34,870
of our corners and there's a dividing
 

193
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,970
of our corners and there's a dividing
line somewhere here oh I think we didn't

194
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:38,980
line somewhere here oh I think we didn't
 

195
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,100
line somewhere here oh I think we didn't
see it over here yeah so this is our

196
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,110
see it over here yeah so this is our
 

197
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,170
see it over here yeah so this is our
dividing line so everything this way I

198
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,180
dividing line so everything this way I
 

199
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,570
dividing line so everything this way I
want to flood eventually that means we

200
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
want to flood eventually that means we
 

201
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,030
want to flood eventually that means we
got to get rid of all that up there all

202
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,040
got to get rid of all that up there all
 

203
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,940
got to get rid of all that up there all
that there and then we're like maybe

204
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:52,950

 

205
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,640

about just shy of 10 blocks probably

206
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:56,650
about just shy of 10 blocks probably
 

207
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,050
about just shy of 10 blocks probably
above the water so I want to dig down

208
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,060
above the water so I want to dig down
 

209
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,680
above the water so I want to dig down
still as well flood this all and then we

210
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:01,690
still as well flood this all and then we
 

211
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,120
still as well flood this all and then we
got light up the caves in this area and

212
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,130
got light up the caves in this area and
 

213
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,350
got light up the caves in this area and
then we should probably be able to get

214
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
then we should probably be able to get
 

215
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,330
then we should probably be able to get
some redstone off of our witch farm

216
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,340
some redstone off of our witch farm
 

217
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,650
some redstone off of our witch farm
hopefully but

218
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:07,660
hopefully but
 

219
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,210
hopefully but
let's let's take a run down here get an

220
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,220
let's let's take a run down here get an
 

221
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,810
let's let's take a run down here get an
idea of the size it is like 200 bucks

222
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:12,820
idea of the size it is like 200 bucks
 

223
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,570
idea of the size it is like 200 bucks
from one side to other right it's quite

224
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:15,580
from one side to other right it's quite
 

225
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,600
from one side to other right it's quite
a bit goes all the way up to here

226
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,610
a bit goes all the way up to here
 

227
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,470
a bit goes all the way up to here
aha so got some some work to do over

228
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:22,480
aha so got some some work to do over
 

229
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:30,840
aha so got some some work to do over
here ladies and gentlemen I present to

230
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:30,850
here ladies and gentlemen I present to
 

231

here ladies and gentlemen I present to
you the world's greatest sniper ever

232
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,610
you the world's greatest sniper ever
 

233
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,840
you the world's greatest sniper ever
known to mankind slushee the Snowman

234
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:41,850

 

235
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,650

he'll get it one day probably not though

236
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,660
he'll get it one day probably not though
 

237
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,940
he'll get it one day probably not though
alright everybody so I don't know if you

238
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:50,950
alright everybody so I don't know if you
 

239
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,440
alright everybody so I don't know if you
guys are gonna be able to handle this

240
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,450
guys are gonna be able to handle this
 

241
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,660
guys are gonna be able to handle this
but I have learnt a new trick check this

242
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:54,670
but I have learnt a new trick check this
 

243
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,110
but I have learnt a new trick check this
out

244
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
out
 

245
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,650
out
if you run and jump off these stairs oh

246
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,660

 

247
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,430

I can fly look at this yeah guys we are

248
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
I can fly look at this yeah guys we are
 

249
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,950
I can fly look at this yeah guys we are
in a copy of our LP world right now I

250
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:07,960
in a copy of our LP world right now I
 

251
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,900
in a copy of our LP world right now I
thought I'd include you on some design

252
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:09,910
thought I'd include you on some design
 

253
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,840
thought I'd include you on some design
stuff right now I don't know this is a

254
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:12,850
stuff right now I don't know this is a
 

255
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,670
stuff right now I don't know this is a
good idea or not but I decided maybe

256
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:14,680
good idea or not but I decided maybe
 

257
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,470
good idea or not but I decided maybe
let's try to get the bomb factory

258
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:16,480
let's try to get the bomb factory
 

259
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,070
let's try to get the bomb factory
working again the last like two or three

260
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
working again the last like two or three
 

261
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,100
working again the last like two or three
attempts of doing that have failed so

262
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,110
attempts of doing that have failed so
 

263
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,960
attempts of doing that have failed so
that's why I'm a little hesitant to try

264
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:24,970
that's why I'm a little hesitant to try
 

265
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,990
that's why I'm a little hesitant to try
again but the game has changed a bit

266
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
again but the game has changed a bit
 

267
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,670
again but the game has changed a bit
since last time so the big problem

268
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
since last time so the big problem
 

269
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,420
since last time so the big problem
before we got the bomb factory part

270
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,430
before we got the bomb factory part
 

271
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,510
before we got the bomb factory part
working like this complicated parts but

272
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:36,520
working like this complicated parts but
 

273
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,820
working like this complicated parts but
I was never able to reliably separate

274
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:38,830
I was never able to reliably separate
 

275
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,180
I was never able to reliably separate
the creepers from other mobs in our mob

276
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,190
the creepers from other mobs in our mob
 

277
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,940
the creepers from other mobs in our mob
separator part there that's really easy

278
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:44,950
separator part there that's really easy
 

279
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,770
separator part there that's really easy
to do now cuz creepers are shorter than

280
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:46,780
to do now cuz creepers are shorter than
 

281
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,500
to do now cuz creepers are shorter than
other mobs they made a change with that

282
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,510
other mobs they made a change with that
 

283
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,890
other mobs they made a change with that
but this bomb factory part doesn't work

284
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:52,900
but this bomb factory part doesn't work
 

285
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,420
but this bomb factory part doesn't work
anymore because they also have changed

286
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,430
anymore because they also have changed
 

287
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,060
anymore because they also have changed
skeletons since I originally made this

288
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,070
skeletons since I originally made this
 

289
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,370
skeletons since I originally made this
now skeletons you know they pull back on

290
00:07:59,370 --> 00:07:59,380
now skeletons you know they pull back on
 

291
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,110
now skeletons you know they pull back on
the bow and they have a little bit

292
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
the bow and they have a little bit
 

293
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,620
the bow and they have a little bit
different

294
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:01,630
different
 

295
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,710
different
AI now so we got a redesign it a little

296
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
AI now so we got a redesign it a little
 

297
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,500
AI now so we got a redesign it a little
bit so when working with mobs I like to

298
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,510
bit so when working with mobs I like to
 

299
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,880
bit so when working with mobs I like to
go into creative because it just

300
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:08,890
go into creative because it just
 

301
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,790
go into creative because it just
simplifies things a lot which is why

302
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,800
simplifies things a lot which is why
 

303
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,230
simplifies things a lot which is why
we're here and I got a try a little

304
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
we're here and I got a try a little
 

305
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,820
we're here and I got a try a little
sequence here this is what I got to

306
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:17,830
sequence here this is what I got to
 

307
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,170
sequence here this is what I got to
figure out so we're gonna have a snow

308
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,180
figure out so we're gonna have a snow
 

309
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,390
figure out so we're gonna have a snow
golem

310
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,400
golem
 

311
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,520
golem
over here right so we want the snow

312
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,530
over here right so we want the snow
 

313
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:30,600
over here right so we want the snow
golem to shoot the skeleton once and we

314
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:30,610
golem to shoot the skeleton once and we
 

315
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,610
golem to shoot the skeleton once and we
also have to detect when that happens we

316
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:32,620
also have to detect when that happens we
 

317
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,290
also have to detect when that happens we
need to prevent the skeleton from

318
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,300
need to prevent the skeleton from
 

319
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,260
need to prevent the skeleton from
shooting the snow golem afterwards so

320
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,270
shooting the snow golem afterwards so
 

321
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,260
shooting the snow golem afterwards so
that's our first challenge then after

322
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,270
that's our first challenge then after
 

323
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,420
that's our first challenge then after
that so we we let the snow glow masseuse

324
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:42,430
that so we we let the snow glow masseuse
 

325
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,880
that so we we let the snow glow masseuse
the skeleton once we detect when that

326
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:44,890
the skeleton once we detect when that
 

327
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,820
the skeleton once we detect when that
happens using a tripwire above here if

328
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:47,830
happens using a tripwire above here if
 

329
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,620
happens using a tripwire above here if
we have a tripwire right above he'll hit

330
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,630
we have a tripwire right above he'll hit
 

331
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,290
we have a tripwire right above he'll hit
his head in that and we can use redstone

332
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:52,300
his head in that and we can use redstone
 

333
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,740
his head in that and we can use redstone
so then open up a thing here which will

334
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:55,750
so then open up a thing here which will
 

335
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,180
so then open up a thing here which will
let a creeper down and then the skeleton

336
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,190
let a creeper down and then the skeleton
 

337
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,510
let a creeper down and then the skeleton
will shoot the creeper and then the

338
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:03,520
will shoot the creeper and then the
 

339
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,190
will shoot the creeper and then the
creeper will blow up when he's near the

340
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
creeper will blow up when he's near the
 

341
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
creeper will blow up when he's near the
skeleton but but when we do that we got

342
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,450
skeleton but but when we do that we got
 

343
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,510
skeleton but but when we do that we got
to make sure the snow boom also doesn't

344
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:09,520
to make sure the snow boom also doesn't
 

345
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,480
to make sure the snow boom also doesn't
shoot the creeper let's focus on that

346
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,490
shoot the creeper let's focus on that
 

347
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,040
shoot the creeper let's focus on that
first here so how do we make the snow

348
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,050
first here so how do we make the snow
 

349
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,530
first here so how do we make the snow
golem shoot the skeleton but not the

350
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:16,540
golem shoot the skeleton but not the
 

351
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,050
golem shoot the skeleton but not the
creeper the way I was doing it before

352
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,060
creeper the way I was doing it before
 

353
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,590
creeper the way I was doing it before
was with a slab but I'm finding that's

354
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,600
was with a slab but I'm finding that's
 

355
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,100
was with a slab but I'm finding that's
changed sometimes the snow golem will

356
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,110
changed sometimes the snow golem will
 

357
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,620
changed sometimes the snow golem will
actually hit the creeper like the slab

358
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,630
actually hit the creeper like the slab
 

359
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,040
actually hit the creeper like the slab
used to always block the snow balls but

360
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,050
used to always block the snow balls but
 

361
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,050
used to always block the snow balls but
every once in a while he's actually

362
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,060
every once in a while he's actually
 

363
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,640
every once in a while he's actually
gonna hit the creeper here I've I've

364
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:35,650
gonna hit the creeper here I've I've
 

365
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,790
gonna hit the creeper here I've I've
noticed so this doesn't work anymore it

366
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
noticed so this doesn't work anymore it
 

367
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,030
noticed so this doesn't work anymore it
actually does nothing I think yeah it's

368
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,040
actually does nothing I think yeah it's
 

369
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,630
actually does nothing I think yeah it's
pretty rare but it does happen so what I

370
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:45,640
pretty rare but it does happen so what I
 

371
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,850
pretty rare but it does happen so what I
was experimenting with here is using

372
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:47,860
was experimenting with here is using
 

373
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,880
was experimenting with here is using
snow slabs snow slabs I think if we get

374
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:50,890
snow slabs snow slabs I think if we get
 

375
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,900
snow slabs snow slabs I think if we get
just the right height it might work

376
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:53,910
just the right height it might work
 

377
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,640
just the right height it might work
let's try it that height there we want

378
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:56,650
let's try it that height there we want
 

379
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,710
let's try it that height there we want
the snow golem to be able to still shoot

380
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
the snow golem to be able to still shoot
 

381
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,160
the snow golem to be able to still shoot
and we can go f3b to see line-of-sight -

382
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,170
and we can go f3b to see line-of-sight -
 

383
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,720
and we can go f3b to see line-of-sight -
that might help us out so yeah I don't

384
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:09,730
that might help us out so yeah I don't
 

385
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,360
that might help us out so yeah I don't
know kind of got to watch it for a bit

386
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,370
know kind of got to watch it for a bit
 

387
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,500
know kind of got to watch it for a bit
but I don't think you'll hit him because

388
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,510
but I don't think you'll hit him because
 

389
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,630
but I don't think you'll hit him because
of the obsidian here gets in the way Oh

390
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
of the obsidian here gets in the way Oh
 

391
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,610
of the obsidian here gets in the way Oh
No aha this is why we test because if

392
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:23,620
No aha this is why we test because if
 

393
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,430
No aha this is why we test because if
this happens when it's fully built

394
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
this happens when it's fully built
 

395
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,350
this happens when it's fully built
goodbye hours and hours of work we don't

396
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,360
goodbye hours and hours of work we don't
 

397
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,329
goodbye hours and hours of work we don't
want it to ever blow up let's go down

398
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:30,339
want it to ever blow up let's go down
 

399
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,079
want it to ever blow up let's go down
one lower hopefully we can find the

400
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,089
one lower hopefully we can find the
 

401
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,320
one lower hopefully we can find the
magic spot here

402
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,330
magic spot here
 

403
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,490
magic spot here
okay you can still see them it looks

404
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,500
okay you can still see them it looks
 

405
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,050
okay you can still see them it looks
like he's shooting upwards though so

406
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,060
like he's shooting upwards though so
 

407
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,000
like he's shooting upwards though so
that might be a problem okay okay you

408
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,010
that might be a problem okay okay you
 

409
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,860
that might be a problem okay okay you
hit a pretty sweet spot here it looks

410
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:46,870
hit a pretty sweet spot here it looks
 

411
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,680
hit a pretty sweet spot here it looks
like it's not quite perfect but it's

412
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:49,690
like it's not quite perfect but it's
 

413
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,540
like it's not quite perfect but it's
it's probably the best we're gonna get I

414
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,550
it's probably the best we're gonna get I
 

415
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,670
it's probably the best we're gonna get I
think the red line on the snow golem has

416
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
think the red line on the snow golem has
 

417
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,800
think the red line on the snow golem has
to be above the blocks here for this to

418
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:55,810
to be above the blocks here for this to
 

419
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,730
to be above the blocks here for this to
work oh did you get shot buddy or did

420
00:10:59,730 --> 00:10:59,740
work oh did you get shot buddy or did
 

421
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,540
work oh did you get shot buddy or did
you shoot yourself I missed that

422
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:03,550
you shoot yourself I missed that
 

423
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,090
you shoot yourself I missed that
I think the skeleton can shoot him if

424
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,100
I think the skeleton can shoot him if
 

425
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,760
I think the skeleton can shoot him if
he's up in the air when he shoots so we

426
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:08,770
he's up in the air when he shoots so we
 

427
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,740
he's up in the air when he shoots so we
might even want to add like a trapdoor

428
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:10,750
might even want to add like a trapdoor
 

429
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,050
might even want to add like a trapdoor
here just so that's less likely but the

430
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,060
here just so that's less likely but the
 

431
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,470
here just so that's less likely but the
snow going to hit the skeleton very

432
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,480
snow going to hit the skeleton very
 

433
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,930
snow going to hit the skeleton very
important skeleton that seems to not be

434
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:21,940
important skeleton that seems to not be
 

435
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,370
important skeleton that seems to not be
able to shoot the snow golem which is

436
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,380
able to shoot the snow golem which is
 

437
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,190
able to shoot the snow golem which is
awesome and the big challenge here as

438
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,200
awesome and the big challenge here as
 

439
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,840
awesome and the big challenge here as
well those we don't want the snow gonna

440
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:27,850
well those we don't want the snow gonna
 

441
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:36,630
well those we don't want the snow gonna
shoot the creeper and he tries I did

442
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
shoot the creeper and he tries I did
 

443
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,780
shoot the creeper and he tries I did
have him hit him once but I think if

444
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:39,790
have him hit him once but I think if
 

445
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,340
have him hit him once but I think if
that happens it's just gonna be a dud

446
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,350
that happens it's just gonna be a dud
 

447
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,140
that happens it's just gonna be a dud
explosion I think we'll be will prevent

448
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,150
explosion I think we'll be will prevent
 

449
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,940
explosion I think we'll be will prevent
it from blowing up in in the chamber

450
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:44,950
it from blowing up in in the chamber
 

451
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,750
it from blowing up in in the chamber
here anyways like a dud when he

452
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:48,760
here anyways like a dud when he
 

453
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,770
here anyways like a dud when he
recombines with the skeleton I mean

454
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:51,780
recombines with the skeleton I mean
 

455
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,890
recombines with the skeleton I mean
uh-huh uh-huh yeah it looks pretty good

456
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:55,900
uh-huh uh-huh yeah it looks pretty good
 

457
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,740
uh-huh uh-huh yeah it looks pretty good
though now it would be really cool if we

458
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:58,750
though now it would be really cool if we
 

459
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,990
though now it would be really cool if we
could find out when the skeleton shoots

460
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,000
could find out when the skeleton shoots
 

461
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,610
could find out when the skeleton shoots
the creeper actually so I'm gonna try

462
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,620
the creeper actually so I'm gonna try
 

463
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,280
the creeper actually so I'm gonna try
put a tripwire above him that creeper is

464
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,290
put a tripwire above him that creeper is
 

465
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,140
put a tripwire above him that creeper is
shorter than skeletons so he might not

466
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,150
shorter than skeletons so he might not
 

467
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,420
shorter than skeletons so he might not
fly up high enough to trigger that let's

468
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,430
fly up high enough to trigger that let's
 

469
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,230
fly up high enough to trigger that let's
put a lamp on so we can see it easy if

470
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
put a lamp on so we can see it easy if
 

471
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,840
put a lamp on so we can see it easy if
it happens and we're gonna put the

472
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:15,850
it happens and we're gonna put the
 

473
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,600
it happens and we're gonna put the
skeleton in here so keep an eye up here

474
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,610
skeleton in here so keep an eye up here
 

475
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,760
skeleton in here so keep an eye up here
see if it flashes when we do this and

476
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:20,770

minutes one moment here I made a mistake
 

507
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,320
minutes one moment here I made a mistake
with this I assumed like once we

508
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,330
with this I assumed like once we
 

509
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,150
with this I assumed like once we
introduce a creeper into this that the

510
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,160
introduce a creeper into this that the

other I don't know what I was thinking
they become each other's enemies right

518

undo oh but the creeper is too far away
so he can't detonate on the snow golem

644
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:33,710
so he can't detonate on the snow golem
 

645
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,920
so he can't detonate on the snow golem
oh okay so that's actually not a problem

646
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:35,930
oh okay so that's actually not a problem
 

647
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,470
oh okay so that's actually not a problem
if it happens

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:42,770
AHA not that it should ever happen all
 

651
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,240
AHA not that it should ever happen all
right I think we're good I think we are

652
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,250
right I think we're good I think we are
 

653
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,680
right I think we're good I think we are
good here so notice the trap door closes

654
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:50,690
good here so notice the trap door closes
 

655
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,000
good here so notice the trap door closes
there for a brief moment I guess let's

656
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,010
there for a brief moment I guess let's
 

657
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,380
there for a brief moment I guess let's
actually try it without the trap door

658
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,390
actually try it without the trap door
 

659
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,300
actually try it without the trap door
maybe I added that in and it's not even

660
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,310
maybe I added that in and it's not even
 

661
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,340
maybe I added that in and it's not even
necessary cuz I didn't do any tests

662
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,350
necessary cuz I didn't do any tests
 

663
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:09,269
necessary cuz I didn't do any tests
without it not sure if it'll matter Oh

664
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:09,279

 

665
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,740

so it almost looked like the snow golem

666
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:11,750
so it almost looked like the snow golem
 

667
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,100
so it almost looked like the snow golem
shot him first there right Jen it might

668
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,110
shot him first there right Jen it might
 

669
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:24,960
shot him first there right Jen it might
actually matter come on there you go

670
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:24,970
actually matter come on there you go
 

671
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,950
actually matter come on there you go
yeah that is why we need the trapdoor

672
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah that is why we need the trapdoor
 

673
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,240
yeah that is why we need the trapdoor
okay so we got the new one loaded in

674
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,250
okay so we got the new one loaded in
 

675
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,190
okay so we got the new one loaded in
here guys and I've added a chamber at

676
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
here guys and I've added a chamber at
 

677
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
here guys and I've added a chamber at
the bottom here I want to test something

678
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:34,850
the bottom here I want to test something
 

679
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,029
the bottom here I want to test something
I want to see how long that creeper

680
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
I want to see how long that creeper
 

681
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,510
I want to see how long that creeper
stays mad at the skeleton for last time

682
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
stays mad at the skeleton for last time
 

683
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,340
stays mad at the skeleton for last time
I tested this the creeper stayed mad

684
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,350
I tested this the creeper stayed mad
 

685
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,100
I tested this the creeper stayed mad
forever but that might have changed

686
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,110
forever but that might have changed
 

687
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,590
forever but that might have changed
because it was a long time ago I tried

688
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
because it was a long time ago I tried
 

689
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,970
because it was a long time ago I tried
that okay so you can see the skeletons

690
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:51,980
that okay so you can see the skeletons
 

691
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,899
that okay so you can see the skeletons
still mad at the snow golem there let's

692
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:55,909
still mad at the snow golem there let's
 

693
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,500

give it a little bit of time here uh-huh

694
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,510
give it a little bit of time here uh-huh
 

695
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,029

now I think once he gets line of sight

698
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
now I think once he gets line of sight
 

699
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:14,680
now I think once he gets line of sight
to the skeleton he should oh oh no they

okay that could be a issue what happened

704
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:22,970
okay that could be a issue what happened
 

705
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,440
okay that could be a issue what happened
there what happened guys I don't know

706
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,450
there what happened guys I don't know
 

707
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,649
there what happened guys I don't know
let's try it again because I'm sure I've

708
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:29,659
let's try it again because I'm sure I've
 

709
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,210
let's try it again because I'm sure I've
had some that have been that longer than

710
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,220
had some that have been that longer than
 

711
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:39,340
had some that have been that longer than
that just be my set up here yeah you

712
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,350
that just be my set up here yeah you
 

713
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,919
that just be my set up here yeah you
still mad okay I tested it a little bit

714
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:44,929
still mad okay I tested it a little bit
 

715
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,840
still mad okay I tested it a little bit
more here guys and it seems like maybe

716
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:46,850
more here guys and it seems like maybe
 

717
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,360
more here guys and it seems like maybe
around 10 seconds roughly that they

718
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,370
around 10 seconds roughly that they
 

719
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,720
around 10 seconds roughly that they
forgive each other but here's the key I

720
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,730
forgive each other but here's the key I
 

721
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,720
forgive each other but here's the key I
found out if we renew their line of

722
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:55,730
found out if we renew their line of
 

723
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,600
found out if we renew their line of
sites every so often then he'll stay

724
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:58,610
sites every so often then he'll stay
 

725
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,370
sites every so often then he'll stay
angry it seems to reset the counter

726
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:02,380

 

727
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,330

he'll stay angry forever
 

729
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,310
he'll stay angry forever
I noticed the skeleton once he stops up

730
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
I noticed the skeleton once he stops up
 

731
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,039
I noticed the skeleton once he stops up
in there that's that's when he forgives

732
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,049
in there that's that's when he forgives
 

733
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,210
in there that's that's when he forgives
us no goal about that amount of time

734
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,220
us no goal about that amount of time
 

735
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,649
us no goal about that amount of time
yeah this week as long as we let them

736
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:16,659
yeah this week as long as we let them
 

737
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:17,909
yeah this week as long as we let them
see each other every now and then

738
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
see each other every now and then
 

739
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,649
see each other every now and then
without the creeper exploding we can

740
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:19,659
without the creeper exploding we can
 

741
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,229
without the creeper exploding we can
transport them as far as we want if they

742
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:22,239
transport them as far as we want if they
 

743
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,649
transport them as far as we want if they
don't despawn is the other condition

744
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:24,659
don't despawn is the other condition
 

745
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,389
don't despawn is the other condition
okay so now I'll try to show you the

746
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:27,399
okay so now I'll try to show you the
 

747
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,009
okay so now I'll try to show you the
Redstone and explain how it works for

748
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:29,019
Redstone and explain how it works for
 

749
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,190
Redstone and explain how it works for
quickly here if possible this is much

750
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,200
quickly here if possible this is much
 

751
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,049
quickly here if possible this is much
smaller than our old design and it seems

752
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:34,059
smaller than our old design and it seems
 

753
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,969
smaller than our old design and it seems
to work a lot better more reliable I

754
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:35,979
to work a lot better more reliable I
 

755
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:39,389
to work a lot better more reliable I
haven't had it fail yet which is good so

756
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:39,399
haven't had it fail yet which is good so
 

757
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,940
haven't had it fail yet which is good so
to begin with let's look over here you

758
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:41,950
to begin with let's look over here you
 

759
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,070
to begin with let's look over here you
see we have two sets of trip wires the

760
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
see we have two sets of trip wires the
 

761
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,489
see we have two sets of trip wires the
upper trip wires here one for both the

762
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:47,499
upper trip wires here one for both the
 

763
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,769
upper trip wires here one for both the
creeper and the skeleton and then

764
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:48,779
creeper and the skeleton and then
 

765
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,839
creeper and the skeleton and then
another pair down here so this first

766
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:51,849
another pair down here so this first
 

767
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,960
another pair down here so this first
pair at the top here just makes sure

768
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:53,970
pair at the top here just makes sure
 

769
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,489
pair at the top here just makes sure
that there is both a creeper and

770
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:56,499
that there is both a creeper and
 

771
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:00,659
that there is both a creeper and
skeleton ready in position so look at

772
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:00,669
skeleton ready in position so look at
 

773
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,330
skeleton ready in position so look at
this indeed over here the creeper is

774
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,340
this indeed over here the creeper is
 

775
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,789
this indeed over here the creeper is
there that torch goes off if a skeletons

776
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:05,799
there that torch goes off if a skeletons
 

777
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,369
there that torch goes off if a skeletons
here and that torch goes off which makes

778
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:08,379
here and that torch goes off which makes
 

779
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,469
here and that torch goes off which makes
this torture turn on all right and when

780
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:13,479
this torture turn on all right and when
 

781
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,210
this torture turn on all right and when
this torch turns on it activates the

782
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,220
this torch turns on it activates the
 

783
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,279
this torch turns on it activates the
redstone it down here goes to here to

784
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,289
redstone it down here goes to here to
 

785
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,560
redstone it down here goes to here to
the trapdoor which drops the skeleton at

786
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,570
the trapdoor which drops the skeleton at
 

787
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,940
the trapdoor which drops the skeleton at
the beginning so that's the first thing

788
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:20,950
the beginning so that's the first thing
 

789
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,820
the beginning so that's the first thing
that happens here only the skeleton

790
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:23,830
that happens here only the skeleton
 

791
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,879
that happens here only the skeleton
falls down not the creeper skeleton

792
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:26,889
falls down not the creeper skeleton
 

793
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,219
falls down not the creeper skeleton
waits to get shots and then he activates

794
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:29,229
waits to get shots and then he activates
 

795
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,529
waits to get shots and then he activates
the wire up there you see that so that

796
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:31,539
the wire up there you see that so that
 

797
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:35,009
the wire up there you see that so that
power is this line down here you follow

798
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:35,019
power is this line down here you follow
 

799
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,859
power is this line down here you follow
it around it goes to this trapdoor to

800
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:37,869
it around it goes to this trapdoor to
 

801
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,369
it around it goes to this trapdoor to
the creeper one drops down the creeper

802
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:40,379
the creeper one drops down the creeper
 

803
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:43,109
the creeper one drops down the creeper
and then when the creeper gets shots

804
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:43,119
and then when the creeper gets shots
 

805
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,070
and then when the creeper gets shots
then it activates this tripwire redstone

806
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,080
then it activates this tripwire redstone
 

807
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,060
then it activates this tripwire redstone
runs here got a sticky piston there down

808
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,070
runs here got a sticky piston there down
 

809
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,999
runs here got a sticky piston there down
to the redstone and pulls back the

810
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:54,009
to the redstone and pulls back the
 

811
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,979
to the redstone and pulls back the
piston so that they fall down if they

812
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:55,989
piston so that they fall down if they
 

813
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,019
piston so that they fall down if they
stayed in there the whole chamber would

814
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:58,029
stayed in there the whole chamber would
 

815
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,539
stayed in there the whole chamber would
explode but we use gravity to get them

816
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:00,549
explode but we use gravity to get them
 

817
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,789
explode but we use gravity to get them
out of there as quick as possible so

818
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
out of there as quick as possible so
 

819
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,950
out of there as quick as possible so
that we break the line of sight if we

820
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
that we break the line of sight if we
 

821
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,659
that we break the line of sight if we
used water streams or something there's

822
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:06,669
used water streams or something there's
 

823
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,009
used water streams or something there's
a chance they might fight the water

824
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:08,019
a chance they might fight the water
 

825
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,869
a chance they might fight the water
currents so that's why I decided to go

826
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:09,879
currents so that's why I decided to go
 

827
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:12,389
currents so that's why I decided to go
for a vertical design this time our old

828
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:12,399
for a vertical design this time our old
 

829
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,460
for a vertical design this time our old
one was using water streams which I

830
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,470
one was using water streams which I
 

831
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,279
one was using water streams which I
don't think was as good and we also got

832
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:17,289
don't think was as good and we also got
 

833
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,289
don't think was as good and we also got
to control that trapdoor right so we use

834
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:19,299
to control that trapdoor right so we use
 

835
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,720
to control that trapdoor right so we use
this wire here to do that connects to

836
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:21,730
this wire here to do that connects to
 

837
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,930
this wire here to do that connects to
the tripwire the skeleton activates if

838
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:24,940
the tripwire the skeleton activates if
 

839
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,650
the tripwire the skeleton activates if
we follow it along here

840
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:26,660
we follow it along here
 

841
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,010
we follow it along here
goes to an inverted trapdoor over here

842
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,020
goes to an inverted trapdoor over here
 

843
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,960
goes to an inverted trapdoor over here
so it's open most the time just when the

844
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:31,970
so it's open most the time just when the
 

845
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,940
so it's open most the time just when the
skeleton gets shot and he wants to shoot

846
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:33,950
skeleton gets shot and he wants to shoot
 

847
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,730
skeleton gets shot and he wants to shoot
the snow golem we close it so it breaks

848
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:36,740
the snow golem we close it so it breaks
 

849
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,860
the snow golem we close it so it breaks
the line of sight and it also sets up

850
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:38,870
the line of sight and it also sets up
 

851
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,720
the line of sight and it also sets up
the timing perfectly for when the the

852
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:40,730
the timing perfectly for when the the
 

853
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,260
the timing perfectly for when the the
creeper enters the chamber AHA and then

854
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,270
creeper enters the chamber AHA and then
 

855
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,960
creeper enters the chamber AHA and then
we got to do what we got to do one other

856
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:46,970
we got to do what we got to do one other
 

857
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,000
we got to do what we got to do one other
thing here you'll notice when the

858
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,010
thing here you'll notice when the
 

859
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,470
thing here you'll notice when the
skeleton Falls and when the creeper

860
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
skeleton Falls and when the creeper
 

861
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,430
skeleton Falls and when the creeper
falls they activate this tripwire here

862
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
falls they activate this tripwire here
 

863
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,220
falls they activate this tripwire here
on the way down and also when they get

864
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,230
on the way down and also when they get
 

865
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,399
on the way down and also when they get
shot so we have to add some redstone to

866
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:00,409
shot so we have to add some redstone to
 

867
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,710
shot so we have to add some redstone to
ignore when they initially fall down

868
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
ignore when they initially fall down
 

869
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,230
ignore when they initially fall down
which is what this stuff here is about

870
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,240
which is what this stuff here is about
 

871
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,590
which is what this stuff here is about
so if this isn't here it like makes this

872
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:08,600
so if this isn't here it like makes this
 

873
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,690
so if this isn't here it like makes this
block go up so that this wire can't

874
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:10,700
block go up so that this wire can't
 

875
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,720
block go up so that this wire can't
connect to here basically so if that's

876
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:13,730
connect to here basically so if that's
 

877
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,140
connect to here basically so if that's
not activated and we try to run this

878
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,150
not activated and we try to run this
 

879
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,710
not activated and we try to run this
watch the difference I think that one we

880
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
watch the difference I think that one we
 

881
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,539
watch the difference I think that one we
removed us for the creeper okay it works

882
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:25,549
removed us for the creeper okay it works
 

883
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,740
removed us for the creeper okay it works
kind of that time but basically it

884
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:29,750
kind of that time but basically it
 

885
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,529
kind of that time but basically it
doesn't wait for the creeper to get shot

886
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:32,539
doesn't wait for the creeper to get shot
 

887
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,230
doesn't wait for the creeper to get shot
other it's like as soon as the creeper

888
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,240
other it's like as soon as the creeper
 

889
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,539
other it's like as soon as the creeper
falls down then he then these pistons

890
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:37,549
falls down then he then these pistons
 

891
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:39,190
falls down then he then these pistons
retract whether or not he gets shot

892
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
retract whether or not he gets shot
 

893
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,000
retract whether or not he gets shot
unless this is here and then we also

894
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,010
unless this is here and then we also
 

895
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,500
unless this is here and then we also
have a thing here for the skeleton which

896
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:47,510
have a thing here for the skeleton which
 

897
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,450
have a thing here for the skeleton which
activates this piston and makes it

898
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,460
activates this piston and makes it
 

899
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,820
activates this piston and makes it
ignore letting the creeper and otherwise

900
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:51,830
ignore letting the creeper and otherwise
 

901
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,409
ignore letting the creeper and otherwise
as soon as the skeleton would fall down

902
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:53,419
as soon as the skeleton would fall down
 

903
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,779
as soon as the skeleton would fall down
and activate this tripwire he would let

904
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:55,789
and activate this tripwire he would let
 

905
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:58,419
and activate this tripwire he would let
the creeper fall down as well because it

906
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:58,429
the creeper fall down as well because it
 

907
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,060
the creeper fall down as well because it
connects right to the creeper one so we

908
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,070
connects right to the creeper one so we
 

909
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,090
connects right to the creeper one so we
got to ignore that the first time well I

910
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,100
got to ignore that the first time well I
 

911
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,070
got to ignore that the first time well I
think we got it figured out guys so we

912
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
think we got it figured out guys so we
 

913
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,250
think we got it figured out guys so we
are back in the LP world here just found

914
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:09,260
are back in the LP world here just found
 

915
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,340
are back in the LP world here just found
a dungeon wanted to check it out

916
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,350
a dungeon wanted to check it out
 

917
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,159
a dungeon wanted to check it out
I think this has been here a long time

918
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:15,169
I think this has been here a long time
 

919
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:17,020
I think this has been here a long time
though so there's probably nothing super

920
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,030
though so there's probably nothing super
 

921
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,630
though so there's probably nothing super
special but yeah I gotta get some

922
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:19,640
special but yeah I gotta get some
 

923
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,820
special but yeah I gotta get some
redstone still need redstone huh yes aha

924
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:24,830
redstone still need redstone huh yes aha
 

925
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,240
redstone still need redstone huh yes aha
okay not much there so this is where we

926
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,250
okay not much there so this is where we
 

927
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,520
okay not much there so this is where we
do the speed mining right at corrupted

928
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:30,530
do the speed mining right at corrupted
 

929
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,080
do the speed mining right at corrupted
border got our beacon here

930
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,090

 

931
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:42,900

[Music]

932
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:42,910

 

933
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,300

redstone it kills me some people

934
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,310
redstone it kills me some people
 

935
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,090
redstone it kills me some people
actually throw this stuff away like what

936
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,100

is wrong with you people that's been so
much time trying to collect it oh I'm at

940
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,360
much time trying to collect it oh I'm at
 

941
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,860
much time trying to collect it oh I'm at
the range of the beach in - okay cool so

942
00:23:59,860 --> 00:23:59,870
the range of the beach in - okay cool so
 

943
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,620
the range of the beach in - okay cool so
we've got some redstone again guys got a

944
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:02,630
we've got some redstone again guys got a
 

945
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,020
we've got some redstone again guys got a
stack of blocks in here - uh-huh

946
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,030
stack of blocks in here - uh-huh
 

947
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,240
stack of blocks in here - uh-huh
very good we got our plan figured outs

948
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,250
very good we got our plan figured outs
 

949
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,370
very good we got our plan figured outs
but one thing we don't have is time

950
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:11,380
but one thing we don't have is time
 

951
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,840
but one thing we don't have is time
getting a little bit long in the episode

952
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:13,850
getting a little bit long in the episode
 

953
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,850
getting a little bit long in the episode
I think we'll try build the creeper

954
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:15,860
I think we'll try build the creeper
 

955
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,140
I think we'll try build the creeper
separator and then we'll do the rest

956
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,150
separator and then we'll do the rest
 

957
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,680
separator and then we'll do the rest
next time so we got to replace this old

958
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:20,690
next time so we got to replace this old
 

959
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,740
next time so we got to replace this old
system we have here that's the old bomb

960
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:23,750
system we have here that's the old bomb
 

961
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,620
system we have here that's the old bomb
factory there that we just read designs

962
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:26,630
factory there that we just read designs
 

963
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,020
factory there that we just read designs
so we're gonna be tearing most this outs

964
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,030
so we're gonna be tearing most this outs
 

965
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:35,830
so we're gonna be tearing most this outs
I think we had a switch at this no it's

966
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
I think we had a switch at this no it's
 

967
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,750
I think we had a switch at this no it's
this over here okay okay and then they

968
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:40,760
this over here okay okay and then they
 

969
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,190
this over here okay okay and then they
drop down here okay that is where we're

970
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
drop down here okay that is where we're
 

971
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,900
drop down here okay that is where we're
gonna start with the whole thing I guess

972
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:48,910
gonna start with the whole thing I guess
 

973
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,370
gonna start with the whole thing I guess
okay last time we did this I was trying

974
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,380
okay last time we did this I was trying
 

975
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,870
okay last time we did this I was trying
to do it with the minecarts and then I

976
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
to do it with the minecarts and then I
 

977
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,050
to do it with the minecarts and then I
discovered oh mobs can actually control

978
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,060
discovered oh mobs can actually control
 

979
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,930
discovered oh mobs can actually control
mine carts now and that did not work

980
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:58,940
mine carts now and that did not work
 

981
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,210
mine carts now and that did not work
like they didn't overpower power rails

982
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,220
like they didn't overpower power rails
 

983
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,160
like they didn't overpower power rails
even if you tell them to go down the

984
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,170
even if you tell them to go down the
 

985
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,290
even if you tell them to go down the
track and they won't listen to you so

986
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:05,300
track and they won't listen to you so
 

987
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,110
track and they won't listen to you so
that was kind of the big downfall last

988
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,120
that was kind of the big downfall last
 

989
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,950
that was kind of the big downfall last
time I just broke a bunch of stuff here

990
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:11,960
time I just broke a bunch of stuff here
 

991
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,810
time I just broke a bunch of stuff here
so we'd have some building space and I

992
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:13,820
so we'd have some building space and I
 

993
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,550
so we'd have some building space and I
think I got a plan for what we're gonna

994
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:15,560
think I got a plan for what we're gonna
 

995
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,090
think I got a plan for what we're gonna
try here so there's not gonna be any men

996
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,100
try here so there's not gonna be any men
 

997
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,470
try here so there's not gonna be any men
in the mob stream here so we only need

998
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
in the mob stream here so we only need
 

999
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,280
in the mob stream here so we only need
two blocks heights one two I think and

1000
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,290
two blocks heights one two I think and
 

1001
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,800
two blocks heights one two I think and
this is where we're gonna separate the

1002
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,810
this is where we're gonna separate the
 

1003
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:33,790
this is where we're gonna separate the
creepers out oh yeah this is a mess okay

1004
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:33,800
creepers out oh yeah this is a mess okay
 

1005
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,620
creepers out oh yeah this is a mess okay
umm it's really hard to do anything okay

1006
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:38,630
umm it's really hard to do anything okay
 

1007
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,700
umm it's really hard to do anything okay
so I think we're gonna want a piston

1008
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:41,710
so I think we're gonna want a piston
 

1009
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,930
so I think we're gonna want a piston
here

1010
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:43,940
here
 

1011
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,900
here
and then we're gonna try to get two more

1012
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,910
and then we're gonna try to get two more
 

1013
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,940
and then we're gonna try to get two more
Oh what just happened

1014
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:48,950
Oh what just happened
 

1015
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,730
Oh what just happened
big leg spike we're fine I think we'll

1016
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:54,740
big leg spike we're fine I think we'll
 

1017
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:01,170
big leg spike we're fine I think we'll
have a glass here two pistons here and

1018
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:01,180
have a glass here two pistons here and
 

1019
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,900
have a glass here two pistons here and
let's put a trapdoor here so this is the

1020
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:04,910
let's put a trapdoor here so this is the
 

1021
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,010
let's put a trapdoor here so this is the
thing like a skeleton and a zombie they

1022
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,020
thing like a skeleton and a zombie they
 

1023
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,930
thing like a skeleton and a zombie they
can't walk through here we can and

1024
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:10,940
can't walk through here we can and
 

1025
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,590
can't walk through here we can and
creepers can as well so there's no

1026
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:14,600
creepers can as well so there's no
 

1027
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,080
creepers can as well so there's no
chance of a zombie or Skelton going here

1028
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,090
chance of a zombie or Skelton going here
 

1029
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,310
chance of a zombie or Skelton going here
this is where the creepers will fall

1030
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,320
this is where the creepers will fall
 

1031
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,780
this is where the creepers will fall
down and then the skeletons and zombies

1032
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:22,790
down and then the skeletons and zombies
 

1033
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,720
down and then the skeletons and zombies
let's make them fall down here make a

1034
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:25,730
let's make them fall down here make a
 

1035
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,120
let's make them fall down here make a
little holding chamber for them just for

1036
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,130
little holding chamber for them just for
 

1037
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,560
little holding chamber for them just for
now while we test this oh that was our

1038
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,570
now while we test this oh that was our
 

1039
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,210
now while we test this oh that was our
floor uh-huh put that back you try to

1040
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:37,220
floor uh-huh put that back you try to
 

1041
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,820
floor uh-huh put that back you try to
make it nice and neat and now we're

1042
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:39,830
make it nice and neat and now we're
 

1043
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:46,570
make it nice and neat and now we're
stuck okay and then to activate these

1044
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:46,580
stuck okay and then to activate these
 

1045
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,650
stuck okay and then to activate these
pistons what do we do I think we want

1046
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:49,660
pistons what do we do I think we want
 

1047
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:58,710
pistons what do we do I think we want
this one extended maybe do it like this

1048
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720

 

1049
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,810

do we have space here oh yeah there's a

1050
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:01,820
do we have space here oh yeah there's a
 

1051
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,660
do we have space here oh yeah there's a
little gap here okay I'm gonna put a

1052
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:04,670
little gap here okay I'm gonna put a
 

1053
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,650
little gap here okay I'm gonna put a
repeater here to activate that piston

1054
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:07,660
repeater here to activate that piston
 

1055
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,390
repeater here to activate that piston
and this will be the block we power and

1056
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
and this will be the block we power and
 

1057
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,940
and this will be the block we power and
then that will activate this piston and

1058
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:15,950
then that will activate this piston and
 

1059
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,120
then that will activate this piston and
then we need to invert this one so let's

1060
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,130
then we need to invert this one so let's
 

1061
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,130
then we need to invert this one so let's
do it like this let's put a repeater

1062
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,140
do it like this let's put a repeater
 

1063
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,420
do it like this let's put a repeater
here and redstone torch on the back and

1064
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:30,430
here and redstone torch on the back and
 

1065
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,100
here and redstone torch on the back and
redstone here okay

1066
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,110
redstone here okay
 

1067
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,780
redstone here okay
well want a little bit of delay on this

1068
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:34,790
well want a little bit of delay on this
 

1069
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,530
well want a little bit of delay on this
one probably and do we have stuff to

1070
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:38,540
one probably and do we have stuff to
 

1071
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,220
one probably and do we have stuff to
make a button I think we do okay

1072
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,230
make a button I think we do okay
 

1073
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,860
make a button I think we do okay
just to try it out here let's see if we

1074
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:44,870
just to try it out here let's see if we
 

1075
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,850
just to try it out here let's see if we
need take a step back to okay so I think

1076
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:48,860
need take a step back to okay so I think
 

1077
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,759
need take a step back to okay so I think
when we press this

1078
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:51,769
when we press this
 

1079
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:59,060
when we press this
kind of hard to see okay so this I think

1080
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,070
kind of hard to see okay so this I think
 

1081
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,970
kind of hard to see okay so this I think
pushed them that way first then when

1082
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:01,980
pushed them that way first then when
 

1083
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,950
pushed them that way first then when
that retracted this one pushed them and

1084
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:03,960
that retracted this one pushed them and
 

1085
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
that retracted this one pushed them and
then this one which went back into place

1086
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:05,970
then this one which went back into place
 

1087
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,810
then this one which went back into place
so I think that should work just

1088
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:10,820
so I think that should work just
 

1089
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,370
so I think that should work just
finished up the holding chambers here

1090
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:13,380
finished up the holding chambers here
 

1091
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,259
finished up the holding chambers here
got it all sealed up and now we're gonna

1092
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:15,269
got it all sealed up and now we're gonna
 

1093
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,649
got it all sealed up and now we're gonna
flip the switch we won't be able to get

1094
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:18,659
flip the switch we won't be able to get
 

1095
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,139
flip the switch we won't be able to get
them out of there just by leaving the

1096
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:21,149
them out of there just by leaving the
 

1097
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,629
them out of there just by leaving the
area only but this will be a good test

1098
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:23,639
area only but this will be a good test
 

1099
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,360
area only but this will be a good test
to see if the thing works so I think the

1100
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,370
to see if the thing works so I think the
 

1101
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,159
to see if the thing works so I think the
creepers might go there on their own

1102
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:28,169
creepers might go there on their own
 

1103
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,899
creepers might go there on their own
that's fine if they do yeah so it'll

1104
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:32,909
that's fine if they do yeah so it'll
 

1105
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:34,850
that's fine if they do yeah so it'll
fall down but the skeletons and zombies

1106
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:34,860
fall down but the skeletons and zombies
 

1107
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,029
fall down but the skeletons and zombies
will never fall down there and we want

1108
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:38,039
will never fall down there and we want
 

1109

to make sure no creepers go down here

1110
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,350
to make sure no creepers go down here
 

1111

to make sure no creepers go down here
because they can fit over here which is

because they can fit over here which is
why we got the arm holding them and now

1114
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
why we got the arm holding them and now
 

1115
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,930
why we got the arm holding them and now
let's see oh darn it

because there was so many in there
 

1121
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,169
because there was so many in there
already and got pushed that way we might

1122
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:09,179
already and got pushed that way we might
 

1123
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,659
already and got pushed that way we might
need to activate this pretty frequently

1124
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:13,669

 

1125
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,860

anyways we'll play with it more next

1126
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:15,870
anyways we'll play with it more next
 

1127

working on the witch farm last time it
 

1137
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,620
working on the witch farm last time it
says wouldn't it be better for the witch

1138

need a certain time to flush out the
witches once they spawned but once

1146

witches once they spawned but once
 

1147

shouldn't there be more time for them to
 

1151
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,919
shouldn't there be more time for them to
respond or in other words keep it dry so

1152
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:42,929
respond or in other words keep it dry so
 

1153

once we actually light up the caves and
 

1159
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,340
once we actually light up the caves and
get maximum spawn rates at the at the

1160
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,350
get maximum spawn rates at the at the
 

1161
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,490
get maximum spawn rates at the at the
moment it's kind of whatever
