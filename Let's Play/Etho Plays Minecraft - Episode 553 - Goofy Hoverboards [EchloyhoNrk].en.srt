uh it's a little bit we're gonna we're

20
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
uh it's a little bit we're gonna we're
 

21
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,390
uh it's a little bit we're gonna we're
gonna fix up the interface

gonna fix up the interface
 

23
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,389
gonna fix up the interface
trust me this is the getting the

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
trust me this is the getting the
 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,069
trust me this is the getting the
connection set up first

26
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
connection set up first
 

27
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,430
connection set up first
and figuring out how we want to do it

28
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
and figuring out how we want to do it
 

29
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,350
and figuring out how we want to do it
first oh

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
first oh
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,950
first oh
oh so we don't want the trapdoor

32
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
oh so we don't want the trapdoor
 

33
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,190
oh so we don't want the trapdoor
triggering twice either

34
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
triggering twice either
 

35
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,030
triggering twice either
because then bad things happen like that

36
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
because then bad things happen like that
 

37
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,790

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
uh but yeah let's uh let's go see how
 

39
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,709
uh but yeah let's uh let's go see how
far away that is so that teleports us

40
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
far away that is so that teleports us
 

41
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,510
far away that is so that teleports us
all the way

42
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
all the way
 

43
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,790
all the way
to over right around

44
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
to over right around
 

45
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,270
to over right around
here so it's quite quite a distance and

00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
the man cave is pretty much below this
 

49
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,069
the man cave is pretty much below this
now so

50
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
now so
 

51
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,430

netherright mining guys
 

61
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,750
netherright mining guys
so we can finally finish up our tools uh

62
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
so we can finally finish up our tools uh

65
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,910
netherride tools are actually pretty
good

66
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
good
 

67
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,590
good
i like the extra durability you get from

68
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
i like the extra durability you get from
 

69
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,670
i like the extra durability you get from
it um and i really do like

70
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
it um and i really do like
 

71
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,990
it um and i really do like
if you die in lava or something your

72
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
if you die in lava or something your
 

73
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,510
if you die in lava or something your
stuff will float on on top it doesn't

74
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
stuff will float on on top it doesn't
 

75
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,390

and i don't have a wither rose farm so i
thought it might be fun to spawn a bunch

150
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
thought it might be fun to spawn a bunch
 

151
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,990
thought it might be fun to spawn a bunch
of snow golems on an end island yeah i

this is a fountain that snowballs up at

168
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
this is a fountain that snowballs up at
 

169
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,390
this is a fountain that snowballs up at
them that's great

170
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
them that's great
 

171
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,830
them that's great
oh he took out the thing right in front

oh he took out the thing right in front
 

173
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,270
oh he took out the thing right in front
of me action shot

174
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
of me action shot
 

175
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,390
of me action shot
all right i think i'm safe am i safe

176
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
all right i think i'm safe am i safe
 

177
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,190
all right i think i'm safe am i safe
probably not safe i'm as safe as i'm

178
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
probably not safe i'm as safe as i'm
 

179
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,070
probably not safe i'm as safe as i'm
gonna be here

180
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
gonna be here
 

181
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,509
gonna be here
let's run around now and pick up the

182
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
let's run around now and pick up the
 

183
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,350
let's run around now and pick up the
wither roses there should be a ton of

184
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
wither roses there should be a ton of
 

185
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,229
wither roses there should be a ton of
them on the ground oh

186
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
them on the ground oh
 

187
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,430
them on the ground oh
lots of snowballs too redstone somebody

188
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
lots of snowballs too redstone somebody
 

189
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,070
lots of snowballs too redstone somebody
hit me

190
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
hit me
 

191
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,190
hit me
let's make sure i'm not falling into the

192
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
let's make sure i'm not falling into the
 

193
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,110
let's make sure i'm not falling into the
void yeah we're good okay i'm just gonna

194
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
void yeah we're good okay i'm just gonna
 

195
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,390
void yeah we're good okay i'm just gonna
scatter them in my inventory like that

196
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
scatter them in my inventory like that
 

197
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,430
scatter them in my inventory like that
so we can pick up more

198
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
so we can pick up more
 

199
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,670
so we can pick up more
and it's working like a champ this is

200
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
and it's working like a champ this is
 

201
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,030
and it's working like a champ this is
great i'm just getting chased by a few

202
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
great i'm just getting chased by a few
 

203
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,550
great i'm just getting chased by a few
endermen but other than that

204
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560

 

205
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,589

seems like a a success to me okay

206
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
seems like a a success to me okay
 

207
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,589
seems like a a success to me okay
well i think that's our cue to leave he

208
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
well i think that's our cue to leave he
 

209
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,630
well i think that's our cue to leave he
pretty much killed all the snow golems

210
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
pretty much killed all the snow golems
 

211
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,990
pretty much killed all the snow golems
uh he'll keep fighting the enderman

212
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
uh he'll keep fighting the enderman
 

213
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,270
uh he'll keep fighting the enderman
though and we'll get with the roses off

214
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
though and we'll get with the roses off
 

215
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,149
though and we'll get with the roses off
of them too

216
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
of them too
 

217
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,350
of them too
but it's much slower

218
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
but it's much slower
 

219
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,949
but it's much slower
yeah he can have the island though i

220
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
yeah he can have the island though i
 

221
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,869
yeah he can have the island though i
think we're we're gonna

222
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
think we're we're gonna
 

223
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,390
think we're we're gonna
just surrender it to him we got plenty

224
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
just surrender it to him we got plenty
 

225
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,830
just surrender it to him we got plenty
of islands we don't need to keep that

226
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
of islands we don't need to keep that
 

227
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,350
of islands we don't need to keep that
one

228
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
one
 

229
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,070
one
and yeah let's head back home here so uh

230
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
and yeah let's head back home here so uh
 

231
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,270
and yeah let's head back home here so uh
all in all we got

232
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
all in all we got
 

233
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,110
all in all we got
a bunch of weather roses we reclaimed

234
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
a bunch of weather roses we reclaimed
 

235
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,470
a bunch of weather roses we reclaimed
some of our snow and

236
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
some of our snow and
 

237
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,070
some of our snow and
it's also a good way of getting endstone

238
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
it's also a good way of getting endstone
 

239
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,830
it's also a good way of getting endstone
just setting up a wither in the

240
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
just setting up a wither in the
 

241
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,589
just setting up a wither in the
end like this he'll he'll farm it for

242
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
end like this he'll he'll farm it for
 

243
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,390
end like this he'll he'll farm it for
you he's gotta go pick it up

244
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
you he's gotta go pick it up
 

245
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,470
you he's gotta go pick it up
we don't go here too often but this is

246
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
we don't go here too often but this is
 

247
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,789
we don't go here too often but this is
where we get our wither skeleton skulls

248
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
where we get our wither skeleton skulls
 

249
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,110
where we get our wither skeleton skulls
from

250
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
from
 

251
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,630
from
we're gonna make a wither skeleton farm

252
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
we're gonna make a wither skeleton farm
 

253
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,789
we're gonna make a wither skeleton farm
today uh it's pretty close to our nether

254
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
today uh it's pretty close to our nether
 

255
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,710
today uh it's pretty close to our nether
hub we're only like 600 blocks away and

256
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
hub we're only like 600 blocks away and
 

257
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,030
hub we're only like 600 blocks away and
the goon farm is up above above the

258
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
the goon farm is up above above the
 

259
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,710
the goon farm is up above above the
bedrock ceiling

260
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
bedrock ceiling
 

261
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,070
bedrock ceiling
and a long time ago we slabbed over most

262
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
and a long time ago we slabbed over most
 

263
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,589
and a long time ago we slabbed over most
of this place and lately i've been

264
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
of this place and lately i've been
 

265
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:13,990
of this place and lately i've been
working

266
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
working
 

267
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,469
working
on uh slapping it even better there's

268
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
on uh slapping it even better there's
 

269
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,990
on uh slapping it even better there's
still a couple spots missing

270
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
still a couple spots missing
 

271
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,789
still a couple spots missing
but it's kind of at the point where we

272
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
but it's kind of at the point where we
 

273
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,710
but it's kind of at the point where we
could probably make a pretty good farm

274
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
could probably make a pretty good farm
 

275
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,110
could probably make a pretty good farm
um it's all slabbed over here we did

276
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
um it's all slabbed over here we did
 

277
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,830
um it's all slabbed over here we did
this

278
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
this
 

279
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,070
this
many years ago actually like when wither

280
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
many years ago actually like when wither
 

281
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,670
many years ago actually like when wither
skeletons first came out and i've just

282
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
skeletons first came out and i've just
 

283
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,030
skeletons first came out and i've just
been like running around the fortress

284
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
been like running around the fortress
 

285
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,830
been like running around the fortress
killing them

286
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
killing them
 

287
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,110
killing them
i kind of want something a bit more

288
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
i kind of want something a bit more
 

289
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,670
i kind of want something a bit more
automatic now yeah so the plan is to

290
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
automatic now yeah so the plan is to
 

291
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,590
automatic now yeah so the plan is to
build our wither skeleton farm at this

292
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
build our wither skeleton farm at this
 

293
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,790
build our wither skeleton farm at this
intersection here

294
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
intersection here
 

295
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,310
intersection here
um you want to build them in the

296
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
um you want to build them in the
 

297
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,749
um you want to build them in the
intersections generally because they're

298
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
intersections generally because they're
 

299
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,350
intersections generally because they're
the biggest piece of the fortress

300
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
the biggest piece of the fortress
 

301
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,830
the biggest piece of the fortress
19 by 19 area and you get up to three

302
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
19 by 19 area and you get up to three
 

303
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,909
19 by 19 area and you get up to three
layers vertically squeezed in

304
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
layers vertically squeezed in
 

305
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,710
layers vertically squeezed in
which is a lot of spawning area we also

306
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
which is a lot of spawning area we also
 

307
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,189
which is a lot of spawning area we also
have another intersection over there

308
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
have another intersection over there
 

309
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,110
have another intersection over there
so it's they're pretty close together

310
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
so it's they're pretty close together
 

311
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,390
so it's they're pretty close together
there's one more up ahead there that

312
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
there's one more up ahead there that
 

313
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,830
there's one more up ahead there that
we'll probably slap over

314
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
we'll probably slap over
 

315
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,350
we'll probably slap over
and i think just for today we're going

316
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
and i think just for today we're going
 

317
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,189
and i think just for today we're going
to keep this pretty simple i just want

318
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
to keep this pretty simple i just want
 

319
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,950
to keep this pretty simple i just want
to get something up and running

320
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
to get something up and running
 

321
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,950
to get something up and running
and then later we'll come back to this

322
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
and then later we'll come back to this
 

323
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,990
and then later we'll come back to this
most likely and try and prove it a bit

324
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
most likely and try and prove it a bit
 

325
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,150
most likely and try and prove it a bit
so we want a 3x3 area in the middle

326
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
so we want a 3x3 area in the middle
 

327
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,110
so we want a 3x3 area in the middle
where the

328
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
where the
 

329
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,710
where the
we'll put a piglet for the wither

330
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
we'll put a piglet for the wither
 

331
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,629
we'll put a piglet for the wither
skeletons to chase and then all around

332
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
skeletons to chase and then all around
 

333
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,510
skeletons to chase and then all around
that

334
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
that
 

335
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,510
that
we're gonna put grass with wither roses

336
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
we're gonna put grass with wither roses
 

337
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,790
we're gonna put grass with wither roses
on top of it

338
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
on top of it
 

339
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,230
on top of it
that's where the withered skeletons will

340
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
that's where the withered skeletons will
 

341
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,189
that's where the withered skeletons will
spawn and i think i might need to go get

342
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
spawn and i think i might need to go get
 

343
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,070
spawn and i think i might need to go get
more weather roses

344
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
more weather roses
 

345
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,790
more weather roses
actually i did the math it's like oh we

346
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
actually i did the math it's like oh we
 

347
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,150
actually i did the math it's like oh we
don't even have like

348
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
don't even have like
 

349
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,990
don't even have like
close to what we need here so from that

350
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
close to what we need here so from that
 

351
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,270
close to what we need here so from that
three by three in the middle we're gonna

352
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
three by three in the middle we're gonna
 

353
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,909
three by three in the middle we're gonna
go seven

354
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
go seven
 

355
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,189
go seven
grass blocks out all around it

356
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199

 

357
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,110

okay here we go i brought that guy from
 

359
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,870
okay here we go i brought that guy from
our nether hub hopefully

360
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
our nether hub hopefully
 

361
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,510
our nether hub hopefully
we don't waste this opportunity this is

362

we don't waste this opportunity this is
 

363
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,710
we don't waste this opportunity this is
always the hardest part about making

364
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
always the hardest part about making
 

365
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,469
always the hardest part about making
these farms

366
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
these farms
 

367
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,430
these farms
just trying to get them into position

running here now i would like to add
another layer above and below this one

396
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
another layer above and below this one
 

397
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,350
another layer above and below this one
we'll just leave a three air block space

398
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
we'll just leave a three air block space
 

399
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,270
we'll just leave a three air block space
for the wither skeletons to spawn

400
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
for the wither skeletons to spawn
 

401
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,390
for the wither skeletons to spawn
uh but we didn't have enough weather

402
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
uh but we didn't have enough weather
 

403
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,990
uh but we didn't have enough weather
roses to do it today we'll have to do it

404
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
roses to do it today we'll have to do it
 

405
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,350
roses to do it today we'll have to do it
another day

406
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
another day
 

407
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,550
another day
um and uh it turns out

um and uh it turns out
 

409
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,390
um and uh it turns out
i probably got a lot more slabbing to do

410
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
i probably got a lot more slabbing to do
 

411
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,230
i probably got a lot more slabbing to do
after all

412
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
after all
 

413
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,230
after all
because i got it up and running and it's

414
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
because i got it up and running and it's
 

415
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,430
because i got it up and running and it's
like okay

416
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
like okay
 

417
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,189
like okay
we'll get maybe one wave of wither

418
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
we'll get maybe one wave of wither
 

419
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,710
we'll get maybe one wave of wither
skeletons and then i just stop

420
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
skeletons and then i just stop
 

421
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,870
skeletons and then i just stop
spotting them completely let's see if

422
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
spotting them completely let's see if
 

423
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,790
spotting them completely let's see if
there's anybody there

424
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
there's anybody there
 

425
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,749
there's anybody there
oh yeah here comes the first wave there

426
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
oh yeah here comes the first wave there
 

427
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,749
oh yeah here comes the first wave there
they go to the piglen they fall down and

428
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
they go to the piglen they fall down and
 

429
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,870
they go to the piglen they fall down and
then

430
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
then
 

431
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,029
then
there's like gonna be very little after

432
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
there's like gonna be very little after
 

433
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,029
there's like gonna be very little after
that so that means there's zombie pigmen

434
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
that so that means there's zombie pigmen
 

435
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,029
that so that means there's zombie pigmen
spawning nearby and they take up the mob

436
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
spawning nearby and they take up the mob
 

437
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,070
spawning nearby and they take up the mob
cap and then

438
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
cap and then
 

439
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,550
cap and then
no more wither skeletons spawn there but

440
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
no more wither skeletons spawn there but
 

441
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,309
no more wither skeletons spawn there but
i did add a thing down below here like a

442
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
i did add a thing down below here like a
 

443
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,589
i did add a thing down below here like a
chamber to

444
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
chamber to
 

445
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,909
chamber to
drop them down i'll get a couple more

446
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
drop them down i'll get a couple more
 

447
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,589
drop them down i'll get a couple more
falling down

448
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
falling down
 

449
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,670
falling down
so i can come here and and get them like

450
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
so i can come here and and get them like
 

451
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,029
so i can come here and and get them like
this now it's a little bit easier than

452
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
this now it's a little bit easier than
 

453
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,350
this now it's a little bit easier than
what i was doing before

454
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
what i was doing before
 

455
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,870
what i was doing before
but it definitely needs some improvement

456
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
but it definitely needs some improvement
 

457
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,029
but it definitely needs some improvement

with the efficiency hose and it's just
 

475
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,670
with the efficiency hose and it's just
really cool

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,350
didn't mean it okay now that he's
touched the ground oh no he still floats

972
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
touched the ground oh no he still floats
 

973
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,790
touched the ground oh no he still floats
i'm gonna try to pull him over and then

974
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
i'm gonna try to pull him over and then
 

975
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,430
i'm gonna try to pull him over and then
like hop on

976
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440

 

977
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,550

oh okay that's a mistake i regret it oh

978
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
oh okay that's a mistake i regret it oh
 

979
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,310
oh okay that's a mistake i regret it oh
we're fine uh he bumped into him

980
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
we're fine uh he bumped into him
 

981
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,470
we're fine uh he bumped into him
up we go to the bedrock ceiling

982
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
up we go to the bedrock ceiling
 

983
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,790
up we go to the bedrock ceiling
that's the goon farm up there so let me

984
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
that's the goon farm up there so let me
 

985
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,629
that's the goon farm up there so let me
know if you guys have any cool ideas for

986
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
know if you guys have any cool ideas for
 

987
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,310
know if you guys have any cool ideas for
what we could use this for but

988
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
what we could use this for but
 

989
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,990
what we could use this for but
i think we'll try one more here i'm just

990
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
i think we'll try one more here i'm just
 

991
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,189
i think we'll try one more here i'm just
curious if we can get him in a boat

992
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
curious if we can get him in a boat
 

993
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,949
curious if we can get him in a boat
and if like the boat will start hovering

994
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
and if like the boat will start hovering
 

995
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:00,790
and if like the boat will start hovering
or something kinda doubt it

996
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800

 

997
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,069

got him yeah just fly in my kite

998
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079

 

999
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,390

that's so good well we still got a few

1000
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
that's so good well we still got a few
 

1001
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,750
that's so good well we still got a few
minutes left here so i thought we would

1002
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
minutes left here so i thought we would
 

1003
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,909
minutes left here so i thought we would
get started on another project a simple

1004
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
get started on another project a simple
 

1005
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,549
get started on another project a simple
one here

1006
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
one here
 

1007
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,949
one here
but a massive one and i'll try to get it

1008
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
but a massive one and i'll try to get it
 

1009
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,710
but a massive one and i'll try to get it
done between episodes

1010
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
done between episodes
 

1011
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,390
done between episodes
uh you might remember a while ago we

1012
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
uh you might remember a while ago we
 

1013
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,990
uh you might remember a while ago we
worked on the guardian farm we put a

1014
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
worked on the guardian farm we put a
 

1015
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,150
worked on the guardian farm we put a
mural in the wall here

1016
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
mural in the wall here
 

1017
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,230
mural in the wall here
a lot of you wanted me to make four of

1018
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
a lot of you wanted me to make four of
 

1019
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,510
a lot of you wanted me to make four of
them in total i don't think we're gonna

1020
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
them in total i don't think we're gonna
 

1021
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,549
them in total i don't think we're gonna
do that we're just gonna do

1022
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
do that we're just gonna do
 

1023
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,430
do that we're just gonna do
two maybe i think chocolate island was

1024
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
two maybe i think chocolate island was
 

1025
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,070
two maybe i think chocolate island was
suggested

1026
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
suggested
 

1027
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,549
suggested
for this side of the wall and then these

1028
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
for this side of the wall and then these
 

1029
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,310
for this side of the wall and then these
other two sides we'll just put

1030
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
other two sides we'll just put
 

1031
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,510
other two sides we'll just put
a giant kelp farm in i think yeah

1032
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
a giant kelp farm in i think yeah
 

1033
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,710
a giant kelp farm in i think yeah
i think that'll look pretty cool it'll

1034
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
i think that'll look pretty cool it'll
 

1035
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,710
i think that'll look pretty cool it'll
kind of suit the water we have in the

1036
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
kind of suit the water we have in the
 

1037
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,150
kind of suit the water we have in the
area so that's what we're going to get

1038
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
area so that's what we're going to get
 

1039
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,270
area so that's what we're going to get
started on

1040
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
started on
 

1041
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,510
started on
and trying out here so this is our

1042
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
and trying out here so this is our
 

1043
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,549
and trying out here so this is our
center point

1044
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
center point
 

1045
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,870
center point
right around here it's even based even

1046
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
right around here it's even based even
 

1047
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,070
right around here it's even based even
numbers

1048
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
numbers
 

1049
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,590
numbers
which can sometimes make things a bit

1050
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
which can sometimes make things a bit
 

1051
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,190
which can sometimes make things a bit
tricky but we will see so

1052
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
tricky but we will see so
 

1053
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,270
tricky but we will see so
around the edges we have the sandstone

1054
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
around the edges we have the sandstone
 

1055
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,510
around the edges we have the sandstone
border i think we're gonna want that to

1056
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
border i think we're gonna want that to
 

1057
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,909
border i think we're gonna want that to
stick out at least one block just so we

1058
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
stick out at least one block just so we
 

1059
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,350
stick out at least one block just so we
have a bit of depth

1060
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
have a bit of depth
 

1061
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,549
have a bit of depth
and then we'll probably put the glass

1062
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
and then we'll probably put the glass
 

1063
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,110
and then we'll probably put the glass
i think we're gonna go for cyan glass

1064
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
i think we're gonna go for cyan glass
 

1065
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,950
i think we're gonna go for cyan glass
instead of the light blue just uh

1066
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
instead of the light blue just uh
 

1067
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,470
instead of the light blue just uh
because i think it's a little easier to

1068
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
because i think it's a little easier to
 

1069
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,270
because i think it's a little easier to
see through

1070
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
see through
 

1071
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,870
see through
hopefully it won't look out of place

1072
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
hopefully it won't look out of place
 

1073
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,710
hopefully it won't look out of place
though i don't know yet

1074
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
though i don't know yet
 

1075
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,830
though i don't know yet
uh so sandstone at this block glass

1076
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
uh so sandstone at this block glass
 

1077
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,669
uh so sandstone at this block glass
the kelp will go here and then we'll

1078
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
the kelp will go here and then we'll
 

1079
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,029
the kelp will go here and then we'll
need a backdrop so

1080
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
need a backdrop so
 

1081
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,110
need a backdrop so
i'm thinking we'll go for the warped

1082
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
i'm thinking we'll go for the warped
 

1083
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,710
i'm thinking we'll go for the warped
wart block

1084
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
wart block
 

1085
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,150
wart block
i think it's uh pretty good for a

1086
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
i think it's uh pretty good for a
 

1087
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,070
i think it's uh pretty good for a
background for water stuff

1088
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
background for water stuff
 

1089
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,950
background for water stuff
it's got a bit of a texture to it so it

1090
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
it's got a bit of a texture to it so it
 

1091
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,630
it's got a bit of a texture to it so it
looks a bit interesting as well through

1092
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
looks a bit interesting as well through
 

1093
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,750
looks a bit interesting as well through
the water

1094
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
the water
 

1095
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,150
the water
so we got to mine out quite a bit of

1096
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
so we got to mine out quite a bit of
 

1097
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,669
so we got to mine out quite a bit of
blocks here

1098
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
blocks here
 

1099
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,549
blocks here
uh all this four blocks deep this big

1100
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
uh all this four blocks deep this big
 

1101
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,630
uh all this four blocks deep this big
giant wall both sides needs to be mined

1102
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
giant wall both sides needs to be mined
 

1103
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,270
giant wall both sides needs to be mined
out

1104
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280

 

1105
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,430

oh that etho guy you gotta check him out

1106
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
oh that etho guy you gotta check him out
 

1107
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,430
oh that etho guy you gotta check him out
he's been playing the same world for

1108
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
he's been playing the same world for
 

1109
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,110
he's been playing the same world for
almost 10 years now

1110
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
almost 10 years now
 

1111
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,310
almost 10 years now
he's done all the things crazy gadgets

1112
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
he's done all the things crazy gadgets
 

1113
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,350
he's done all the things crazy gadgets
all the gizmos you could imagine to my

1114
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
all the gizmos you could imagine to my
 

1115
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,710
all the gizmos you could imagine to my
utmost shame

1116
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
utmost shame
 

1117
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,909
utmost shame
i've never made a kelp farm in

1118
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
i've never made a kelp farm in
 

1119
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,630
i've never made a kelp farm in
any series i've never ever made a kelp

1120
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
any series i've never ever made a kelp
 

1121
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,070
any series i've never ever made a kelp
farm so i might making some mistakes

1122
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
farm so i might making some mistakes
 

1123
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,190
farm so i might making some mistakes
with this i don't know

1124
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
with this i don't know
 

1125
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,029
with this i don't know
just kind of winging it here i think the

1126
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
just kind of winging it here i think the
 

1127
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,549
just kind of winging it here i think the
kelp plants going to go here

1128
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
kelp plants going to go here
 

1129
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,909
kelp plants going to go here
we're going to put blocks in front of

1130
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
we're going to put blocks in front of
 

1131
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,150
we're going to put blocks in front of
the sticky pistons so you can't see them

1132
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
the sticky pistons so you can't see them
 

1133
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,950
the sticky pistons so you can't see them
and then it's going to extend out and

1134
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
and then it's going to extend out and
 

1135
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,549
and then it's going to extend out and
break the kelp and it's going to float

1136
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
break the kelp and it's going to float
 

1137
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,990
break the kelp and it's going to float
up and we're gonna collect it at the top

1138
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
up and we're gonna collect it at the top
 

1139
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,750
up and we're gonna collect it at the top
i think that's all there is to it right

1140
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
i think that's all there is to it right
 

1141
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,390
i think that's all there is to it right
okay well we got it mined out i beefed

1142
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
okay well we got it mined out i beefed
 

1143
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,789
okay well we got it mined out i beefed
up the sandstone we got the backdrop

1144
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
up the sandstone we got the backdrop
 

1145
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,990
up the sandstone we got the backdrop
in uh i put sand and sandstone for the

1146
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
in uh i put sand and sandstone for the
 

1147
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,110
in uh i put sand and sandstone for the
floor

1148
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
floor
 

1149
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,110
floor
that we're gonna plant the kelp on and

1150
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
that we're gonna plant the kelp on and
 

1151
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,789
that we're gonna plant the kelp on and
this is what it's looking like i'm a

1152
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
this is what it's looking like i'm a
 

1153
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,909
this is what it's looking like i'm a
little worried

1154
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
little worried
 

1155
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,669
little worried
it's going to be too plain just like

1156
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
it's going to be too plain just like
 

1157
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,710
it's going to be too plain just like
that we might need to add some details

1158
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
that we might need to add some details
 

1159
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,470
that we might need to add some details
but we'll try it we'll see how it looks

1160
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
but we'll try it we'll see how it looks
 

1161
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,470
but we'll try it we'll see how it looks
i guess so the last thing i'm going to

1162
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
i guess so the last thing i'm going to
 

1163
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,390
i guess so the last thing i'm going to
do here is put well not the last thing

1164
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
do here is put well not the last thing
 

1165
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,789
do here is put well not the last thing
but

1166
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
but
 

1167
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,590
but
the next thing is uh put the cyan glass

1168
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
the next thing is uh put the cyan glass
 

1169
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,430
the next thing is uh put the cyan glass
in front and then we gotta start

1170
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
in front and then we gotta start
 

1171
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,350
in front and then we gotta start
flooding it and putting the tail plants

1172
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
flooding it and putting the tail plants
 

1173
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,750
flooding it and putting the tail plants
in now the question is if you guys are

1174
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
in now the question is if you guys are
 

1175
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,430
in now the question is if you guys are
building a giant wall like this

1176
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
building a giant wall like this
 

1177
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,270
building a giant wall like this
how do you place your blocks i like to

1178
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
how do you place your blocks i like to
 

1179
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,470
how do you place your blocks i like to
go horizontally like this some people

1180
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
go horizontally like this some people
 

1181
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,070
go horizontally like this some people
though they like to stack up in

1182
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
though they like to stack up in
 

1183
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,070
though they like to stack up in
maybe three blocks or so and then they

1184
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
maybe three blocks or so and then they
 

1185
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,630
maybe three blocks or so and then they
kind of crouch and go over like this

1186
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
kind of crouch and go over like this
 

1187
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,149
kind of crouch and go over like this
i've never really liked that method i

1188
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
i've never really liked that method i
 

1189
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,909
i've never really liked that method i
don't know why it just feels slower to

1190
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
don't know why it just feels slower to
 

1191
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,630
don't know why it just feels slower to
me somehow

1192
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
me somehow
 

1193
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,950
me somehow
aha so we got all the glass in now we

1194
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
aha so we got all the glass in now we
 

1195
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,870
aha so we got all the glass in now we
might need to add lighting in there as

1196
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
might need to add lighting in there as
 

1197
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,590
might need to add lighting in there as
well

1198
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
well
 

1199
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,710
well
we'll see how it looks but now we got to

1200
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
we'll see how it looks but now we got to
 

1201
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,270
we'll see how it looks but now we got to
start

1202
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
start
 

1203
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,230
start
putting the water and the kelp in my

1204
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
putting the water and the kelp in my
 

1205
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,470
putting the water and the kelp in my
question is

1206
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
question is
 

1207
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,830
question is
there's a certain trick in this game

1208
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
there's a certain trick in this game
 

1209
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,789
there's a certain trick in this game
that like everybody seems to love and

1210
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
that like everybody seems to love and
 

1211
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,310
that like everybody seems to love and
i've never used it

1212
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
i've never used it
 

1213
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,710
i've never used it
the water and kelp thing can we use that

1214
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
the water and kelp thing can we use that
 

1215
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,070
the water and kelp thing can we use that
here like can we grow that

1216
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
here like can we grow that
 

1217
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,390
here like can we grow that
into this downward yeah you can okay

1218
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
into this downward yeah you can okay
 

1219
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,909
into this downward yeah you can okay
that is probably what we want to do then

1220
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
that is probably what we want to do then
 

1221
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,669
that is probably what we want to do then
we'll place water at the top

1222
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
we'll place water at the top
 

1223
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,750
we'll place water at the top
and then the kelp will grow into it and

1224
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
and then the kelp will grow into it and
 

1225
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,710
and then the kelp will grow into it and
we don't have to

1226
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
we don't have to
 

1227
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,029
we don't have to
place every single source block oh man

1228
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
place every single source block oh man
 

1229
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,870
place every single source block oh man
this is actually pretty cool i didn't

1230
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
this is actually pretty cool i didn't
 

1231
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,430
this is actually pretty cool i didn't
know this

1232
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
know this
 

1233
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,430
know this
so you don't even need to place it at

1234
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
so you don't even need to place it at
 

1235
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,630
so you don't even need to place it at
the top

1236
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
the top
 

1237
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,149
the top
if you just left it like this i think

1238
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
if you just left it like this i think
 

1239
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,390
if you just left it like this i think
eventually this would fill up totally

1240
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
eventually this would fill up totally
 

1241
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,390
eventually this would fill up totally
with water source blocks

1242
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
with water source blocks
 

1243
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,510
with water source blocks
because this plant will grow up and as

1244
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
because this plant will grow up and as
 

1245
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,390
because this plant will grow up and as
it does the water

1246
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
it does the water
 

1247
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,990
it does the water
oh maybe not did i get it wrong

1248
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
oh maybe not did i get it wrong
 

1249
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,830
oh maybe not did i get it wrong
i might have got it wrong okay maybe

1250
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
i might have got it wrong okay maybe
 

1251
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,029
i might have got it wrong okay maybe
it's this one that needs to grow

1252
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
it's this one that needs to grow
 

1253
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,990
it's this one that needs to grow
that one grows that one will reach the

1254
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
that one grows that one will reach the
 

1255
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,669
that one grows that one will reach the
top and then this one can start growing

1256
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
top and then this one can start growing
 

1257
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,070
top and then this one can start growing
right

1258
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
right
 

1259
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,750
right
yeah this one grows and then the water

1260
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
yeah this one grows and then the water
 

1261
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,590
yeah this one grows and then the water
moves over one block

1262
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
moves over one block
 

1263
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,830
moves over one block
and then this one can grow the water

1264
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
and then this one can grow the water
 

1265
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,430
and then this one can grow the water
moves over another block

1266
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
moves over another block
 

1267
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,350
moves over another block
and eventually it'll make it its way all

1268
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
and eventually it'll make it its way all
 

1269
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,950
and eventually it'll make it its way all
the way down to the end it would take a

1270
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
the way down to the end it would take a
 

1271
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,549
the way down to the end it would take a
long time but it's possible

1272
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
long time but it's possible
 

1273
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,470
long time but it's possible
well anyways we got the whole thing

1274
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
well anyways we got the whole thing
 

1275
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,310
well anyways we got the whole thing
flooded and the kelp has grown to the

1276
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
flooded and the kelp has grown to the
 

1277
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,909
flooded and the kelp has grown to the
maximum this is what it's going to look

1278
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
maximum this is what it's going to look
 

1279
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,270
maximum this is what it's going to look
like when that happens

1280
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
like when that happens
 

1281
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,029
like when that happens
uh we'll probably harvest it before that

1282
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
uh we'll probably harvest it before that
 

1283
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,789
uh we'll probably harvest it before that
does ever happen though it'll be

1284
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
does ever happen though it'll be
 

1285
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,549
does ever happen though it'll be
shorter um yeah what do you guys think i

1286
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
shorter um yeah what do you guys think i
 

1287
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,990
shorter um yeah what do you guys think i
think it's better than the gray wall we

1288
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
think it's better than the gray wall we
 

1289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,750
think it's better than the gray wall we
had there but it might need to add a bit

1290
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
had there but it might need to add a bit
 

1291
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,590
had there but it might need to add a bit
more to it i'm not sure

1292
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
more to it i'm not sure
 

1293
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,029
more to it i'm not sure
it's pretty plain uh but yeah i think we

1294
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
it's pretty plain uh but yeah i think we
 

1295
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,470
it's pretty plain uh but yeah i think we
gotta wrap it up for today i didn't get

1296
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
gotta wrap it up for today i didn't get
 

1297
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,909
gotta wrap it up for today i didn't get
the redstone hooked up to it or the

1298
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
the redstone hooked up to it or the
 

1299
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,510
the redstone hooked up to it or the
collection system or any of that

1300
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
collection system or any of that
 

1301
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,750
collection system or any of that
i'll do that between episodes probably

1302
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
i'll do that between episodes probably
 

1303
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,590
i'll do that between episodes probably
but the comment of the day says hey etho

1304
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
but the comment of the day says hey etho
 

1305
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,549
but the comment of the day says hey etho
what are you gonna do about the new 1.17

1306
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
what are you gonna do about the new 1.17
 

1307
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,350
what are you gonna do about the new 1.17
update

1308
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
update
 

1309
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,070
update
coming next year the cave updates i'd

1310
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
coming next year the cave updates i'd
 

1311
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,950
coming next year the cave updates i'd
love to see you

1312
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
love to see you
 

1313
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,750
love to see you
start anew instead of going off tens of

1314
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
start anew instead of going off tens of
 

1315
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,430
start anew instead of going off tens of
thousands of blocks to get to the

1316
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
thousands of blocks to get to the
 

1317
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,310
thousands of blocks to get to the
new terrain again either way suits me

1318
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
new terrain again either way suits me
 

1319
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,510
new terrain again either way suits me
however i'd love to hear your opinion

1320
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
however i'd love to hear your opinion
 

1321
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,950
however i'd love to hear your opinion
uh yeah it's probably a little bit too

1322
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
uh yeah it's probably a little bit too
 

1323
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,270
uh yeah it's probably a little bit too
early to know exactly what i'm gonna do

1324
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
early to know exactly what i'm gonna do
 

1325
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,549
early to know exactly what i'm gonna do
we gotta figure out how they're gonna

1326
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
we gotta figure out how they're gonna
 

1327
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,149
we gotta figure out how they're gonna
implement things and all that

1328
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
implement things and all that
 

1329
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,950
implement things and all that
uh before we can make calls uh i had a

1330
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
uh before we can make calls uh i had a
 

1331
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,750
uh before we can make calls uh i had a
lot of people

1332
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
lot of people
 

1333
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,230
lot of people
asking me about that though uh most

1334
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
asking me about that though uh most
 

1335
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,430
asking me about that though uh most
likely we'll just go

1336
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
likely we'll just go
 

1337
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,070
likely we'll just go
to a new area and uh play around in the

1338
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
to a new area and uh play around in the
 

1339
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,470
to a new area and uh play around in the
new

1340
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
new
 

1341
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,350
new
new features like we usually do um i

1342
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
new features like we usually do um i
 

1343
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,149
new features like we usually do um i
don't need to go

1344
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
don't need to go
 

1345
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,270
don't need to go
very far like not tens of thousands

1346
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
very far like not tens of thousands
 

1347
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,270
very far like not tens of thousands
if i go 2 000 blocks that way over the

1348
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
if i go 2 000 blocks that way over the
 

1349
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,750
if i go 2 000 blocks that way over the
mountains it's new terrain

1350
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
mountains it's new terrain
 

1351
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,990
mountains it's new terrain
i don't explore much in the world here

1352
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
i don't explore much in the world here
 

1353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,590
i don't explore much in the world here
actually i try not to

1354
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
actually i try not to
 

1355
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,830
actually i try not to
because it makes the world bigger and i

1356
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
because it makes the world bigger and i
 

1357
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,990
because it makes the world bigger and i
gotta go farther right so

1358
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
gotta go farther right so
 

1359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,909
gotta go farther right so
there is stuff nearby where we haven't

1360
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
there is stuff nearby where we haven't
 

1361
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,029
there is stuff nearby where we haven't
explored for sure

1362
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
explored for sure
 

1363
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,950
explored for sure
lots of it now before we wrap up the

1364
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
lots of it now before we wrap up the
 

1365
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,110
lots of it now before we wrap up the
episode i do want to talk about how i

1366
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
episode i do want to talk about how i
 

1367
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,870
episode i do want to talk about how i
think they should implement the skulk

1368
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
think they should implement the skulk
 

1369
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,909
think they should implement the skulk
sensor

1370
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
sensor
 

1371
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,029
sensor
because that's the thing i'm most

1372
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
because that's the thing i'm most
 

1373
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,430
because that's the thing i'm most
excited about in the next update

1374
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
excited about in the next update
 

1375
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,310
excited about in the next update
the redstone thing obviously um so if

1376
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
the redstone thing obviously um so if
 

1377
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,510
the redstone thing obviously um so if
you don't know it's basically going to

1378
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
you don't know it's basically going to
 

1379
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,870
you don't know it's basically going to
be a sensor that can

1380
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
be a sensor that can
 

1381
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,990
be a sensor that can
sense sounds or vibrations so if you

1382
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
sense sounds or vibrations so if you
 

1383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,350
sense sounds or vibrations so if you
look at the bottom right i turn the

1384
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
look at the bottom right i turn the
 

1385
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,149
look at the bottom right i turn the
sound

1386
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
sound
 

1387
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,549
sound
text on to give you an idea what's going

1388
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
text on to give you an idea what's going
 

1389
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,430
text on to give you an idea what's going
on here

1390
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
on here
 

1391
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,390
on here
so every sound in the game has its own

1392
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
so every sound in the game has its own
 

1393
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,669
so every sound in the game has its own
unique uh

1394
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
unique uh
 

1395
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,110
unique uh

as you walk footsteps play so having a

1398
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
as you walk footsteps play so having a
 

1399
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,510
as you walk footsteps play so having a
sensor that can detect sounds is going

1400
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
sensor that can detect sounds is going
 

1401
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,390
sensor that can detect sounds is going
to be really

1402
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
to be really
 

1403
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,710
to be really
cool uh especially because it does other

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
cool uh especially because it does other
 

1405
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,470
cool uh especially because it does other
things it's got the wireless redstone

1406
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
things it's got the wireless redstone
 

1407
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,269
things it's got the wireless redstone
feature

1408
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
feature
 

1409
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,110
feature
uh something i i noticed that i don't

1410
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
uh something i i noticed that i don't
 

1411
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,549
uh something i i noticed that i don't
think a lot of people mentioned is it

1412
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
think a lot of people mentioned is it
 

1413
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,390
think a lot of people mentioned is it
seemed like you could use it as a timer

1414
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
seemed like you could use it as a timer
 

1415
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,190
seemed like you could use it as a timer
as well like

1416
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
as well like
 

1417
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,669
as well like
the time to send from one skulk sensor

1418
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
the time to send from one skulk sensor
 

1419
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,350
the time to send from one skulk sensor
to the other

1420
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
to the other
 

1421
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,190
to the other
seem to be based on how far apart they

1422
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
seem to be based on how far apart they
 

1423
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,789
seem to be based on how far apart they
were from each other so that i could see

1424
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
were from each other so that i could see
 

1425
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,630
were from each other so that i could see
that being quite useful

1426
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
that being quite useful
 

1427
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,830
that being quite useful
um and just on its own if it's a

1428
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
um and just on its own if it's a
 

1429
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,990
um and just on its own if it's a
general sound sensor that's gonna be

1430
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
general sound sensor that's gonna be
 

1431
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,830
general sound sensor that's gonna be
great but the thing that will make it

1432
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
great but the thing that will make it
 

1433
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,190
great but the thing that will make it
amazing

1434
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
amazing
 

1435
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,190
amazing
is if they make it so you can filter

1436
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
is if they make it so you can filter
 

1437
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,029
is if they make it so you can filter
specific sounds

1438
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
specific sounds
 

1439
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,470
specific sounds
uh they're gonna have directional

1440
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
uh they're gonna have directional
 

1441
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,149
uh they're gonna have directional
filtering with the wool blocks

1442
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
filtering with the wool blocks
 

1443
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,430
filtering with the wool blocks
but specific sounds like footsteps you

1444
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
but specific sounds like footsteps you
 

1445
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,430
but specific sounds like footsteps you
walk along and a door opens only if it

1446
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
walk along and a door opens only if it
 

1447
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,870
walk along and a door opens only if it
hears footsteps

1448
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
hears footsteps
 

1449
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,350
hears footsteps
um that would be amazing the problem is

1450
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
um that would be amazing the problem is
 

1451
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,630
um that would be amazing the problem is
if it's like all

1452
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
if it's like all
 

1453
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,630
if it's like all
sounds you could have a bat spawn and

1454
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
sounds you could have a bat spawn and
 

1455
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,710
sounds you could have a bat spawn and
then it's gonna cause your redstone

1456
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
then it's gonna cause your redstone
 

1457
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,669
then it's gonna cause your redstone
device to trigger

1458
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
device to trigger
 

1459
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,750
device to trigger
and you're gonna get mad and frustrated

1460
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
and you're gonna get mad and frustrated
 

1461
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,510
and you're gonna get mad and frustrated
so i think they kind of need to add

1462
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
so i think they kind of need to add
 

1463
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,710
so i think they kind of need to add
filters

1464
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
filters
 

1465
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,950
filters
how do they do its next question i would

1466
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
how do they do its next question i would
 

1467
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,789
how do they do its next question i would
like to see them add filters in two

1468
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
like to see them add filters in two
 

1469
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,789
like to see them add filters in two
different ways so let's pretend this is

1470
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
different ways so let's pretend this is
 

1471
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,070
different ways so let's pretend this is
our skulk sensor

1472
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
our skulk sensor
 

1473
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,350
our skulk sensor
over here um firstly

1474
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
over here um firstly
 

1475
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,110
over here um firstly
for newer players or people that don't

1476
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
for newer players or people that don't
 

1477
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,950
for newer players or people that don't
really understand how it works i would

1478
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
really understand how it works i would
 

1479
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,510
really understand how it works i would
love it

1480
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
love it
 

1481
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,190
love it
if you could right click it and then

1482
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
if you could right click it and then
 

1483
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,110
if you could right click it and then
maybe a light turns on

1484
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
maybe a light turns on
 

1485
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,870
maybe a light turns on
or you get some kind of visual

1486
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
or you get some kind of visual
 

1487
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,470
or you get some kind of visual
indication that it's in

1488
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
indication that it's in
 

1489
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,870
indication that it's in
listening mode maybe some particles are

1490
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
listening mode maybe some particles are
 

1491
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,950
listening mode maybe some particles are
spawning off of it who knows

1492
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
spawning off of it who knows
 

1493
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,110
spawning off of it who knows
when it's in listening mode it listens

1494
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
when it's in listening mode it listens
 

1495
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,430
when it's in listening mode it listens
to all sounds around it and the last one

1496
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
to all sounds around it and the last one
 

1497
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,750
to all sounds around it and the last one
it

1498
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
it
 

1499
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,630
it
hears is what the filter gets set to and

1500
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
hears is what the filter gets set to and
 

1501
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,230
hears is what the filter gets set to and
then when you shut it off

1502
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
then when you shut it off
 

1503
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,710
then when you shut it off
it saves it basically and i would like

1504
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
it saves it basically and i would like
 

1505
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,310
it saves it basically and i would like
it if like

1506
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
it if like
 

1507
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,870
it if like
you when you hover over it if it says

1508
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
you when you hover over it if it says
 

1509
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,630
you when you hover over it if it says
what it is or maybe there's some way to

1510
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,640
what it is or maybe there's some way to
 

1511
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,310
what it is or maybe there's some way to
even play the sound

1512
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
even play the sound
 

1513
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,870
even play the sound
from it and so when you look at it maybe

1514
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
from it and so when you look at it maybe
 

1515
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,470
from it and so when you look at it maybe
it says what the sound

1516
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
it says what the sound
 

1517
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,710
it says what the sound
is the other way i would like to see it

1518
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
is the other way i would like to see it
 

1519
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,470
is the other way i would like to see it
is for more experienced minecraft

1520
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
is for more experienced minecraft
 

1521
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,350
is for more experienced minecraft
players like

1522
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
players like
 

1523
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,950
players like
hey maybe you know what the sounds are

1524
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
hey maybe you know what the sounds are
 

1525
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,710
hey maybe you know what the sounds are
in the game and you could name

1526
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
in the game and you could name
 

1527
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,950
in the game and you could name
pretend i'm naming the skull sensor

1528
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
pretend i'm naming the skull sensor
 

1529
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,669
pretend i'm naming the skull sensor
right now footsteps

1530
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
right now footsteps
 

1531
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,430
right now footsteps
you name it and then the filter gets set

1532
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
you name it and then the filter gets set
 

1533
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,750
you name it and then the filter gets set
to that and then

1534
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
to that and then
 

1535
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,310
to that and then
if it's like an mbt data stuff it it'll

1536
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
if it's like an mbt data stuff it it'll
 

1537
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,430
if it's like an mbt data stuff it it'll
save it

1538
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
save it
 

1539
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,430
save it
even after you pick it up and put it

1540
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
even after you pick it up and put it
 

1541
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,190
even after you pick it up and put it
down again it'll still

1542
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
down again it'll still
 

1543
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,269
down again it'll still
keep that filter so you could do like

1544
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
keep that filter so you could do like
 

1545
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,710
keep that filter so you could do like
full stacks of them at a time

1546
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
full stacks of them at a time
 

1547
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,950
full stacks of them at a time
even and i think if they could only pick

1548
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
even and i think if they could only pick
 

1549
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,549
even and i think if they could only pick
one of those options i would want them

1550
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
one of those options i would want them
 

1551
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,070
one of those options i would want them
to pick the first one because it

1552
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
to pick the first one because it
 

1553
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,990
to pick the first one because it
wouldn't require any game knowledge

1554
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
wouldn't require any game knowledge
 

1555
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,390
wouldn't require any game knowledge
and anybody could do it and i like the

1556
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
and anybody could do it and i like the
 

1557
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,350
and anybody could do it and i like the
idea like

1558
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
idea like
 

1559
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,149
idea like
if you wanted to react to pig sounds

1560
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
if you wanted to react to pig sounds
 

1561
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,070
if you wanted to react to pig sounds
you'd have to bring a pig next to the

1562
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
you'd have to bring a pig next to the
 

1563
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,470
you'd have to bring a pig next to the
sensor like it would involve interacting

1564
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
sensor like it would involve interacting
 

1565
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,990
sensor like it would involve interacting
with the world more so i think that's

1566
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
with the world more so i think that's
 

1567
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,110
with the world more so i think that's
better

1568
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
better
 

1569
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,149
better
although it would be more tedious

1570
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
although it would be more tedious
 

1571
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,830
although it would be more tedious
anyways those are a couple of my ideas

1572
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
anyways those are a couple of my ideas
 

1573
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,110
anyways those are a couple of my ideas
let me know what you think of it we're

1574
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
let me know what you think of it we're
 

1575
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,789
let me know what you think of it we're
gonna wrap up for today though thank you
